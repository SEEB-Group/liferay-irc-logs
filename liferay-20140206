05:07 < Axxell:#liferay> Hey guys, trying to get my theme to load fast and get a better performance grade.. css and jss files are in 9 seperate files, i do have in ext-portal.properties javascript.fast.load=true theme.css.fast.load=true, but still these 9 files do not combine? How do i do that?
05:20 < Axxell:#liferay> anyone?
05:31 < Axxell:#liferay> yslow says that its 12js files and 10css files... is there anyway to force them to combine
06:45 < Axxell:#liferay> please help fellow mamals!
09:08 < modd_:#liferay> hi there
09:10 < modd_:#liferay> I have a LR6.0.6 here which should use users.email.address.required=false
09:11 < modd_:#liferay> and it works, I can create users without email
09:11 < modd_:#liferay> but if these users try to login, they have to add an email or they can't do anything
09:11 < modd_:#liferay> seems like it recognize an email with the given suffix as invalid :\
09:18 < modd_:#liferay> found a ticket: https://support.liferay.com/browse/LPS-21083
12:58 <@jhf:#liferay> nightly builds back on: http://releases.liferay.com/portal/nightly/
12:58 <@jhf:#liferay> yay!!
12:59 -!- jhf changed the topic of #liferay to: Liferay Community Discussion Channel! *THIS CHANNEL IS LOGGED* (Log: http://goo.gl/SMte1N) Plz be patient - timezones matter :)  Liferay 6.2 GA1 RELEASE http://goo.gl/XMZiG3   Forum: http://forums.liferay.com Homepage: http://liferay.org User Groups http://goo.gl/WFVtPe Nightly build http://goo.gl/vQngHn
13:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, why were they tuned off?
13:02 <@jhf:#liferay> lack of care and feeding
13:05 <@jhf:#liferay> no one turned it off, it just quietly died :)
13:05 <@jhf:#liferay> (presumably someone changed a script somewhere in the build system, and didn't think about the impact on the nightlies)
13:05 <@jhf:#liferay> dang script kiddies
14:52 < kim____:#liferay> How can i debug sso issues? "10.241.42.32
14:52 < kim____:#liferay> -ip
14:52 < kim____:#liferay> "Liferay has failed to connect to the OpenSSO server. Please check your configuration and verify that the OpenSSO server is running."
14:57 <@jhf:#liferay> kim____: turn on debugging via Control Panel -> Server Administration -> Log Levels
14:58 <@jhf:#liferay> for log com.liferay.portal.security.auth and com.liferay.portal.servlet.filters.sso turn them both to the ALL log level
14:58 <@jhf:#liferay> (add them if those two loggers aren't listed on the log levels screen)
15:01 < kim____:#liferay> Thanks!
15:05 <@jhf:#liferay> are you really using OpenSSO (i.e. the product from Sun Microsystems)?
15:05 <@jhf:#liferay> Or OpenAM (or Oracle Identity Manager)?
15:56 < kim____:#liferay> jhf: No, OpenAM:)
15:57 < kim____:#liferay> "Test OpenSSO Configuration" is now loading forever...
15:59 <@jhf:#liferay> also watch the Liferay log file for clues
15:59 <@jhf:#liferay> if you're using tomcat, it's in tomcat-xx.xx.xx/logs/catalina.out
16:00 < kim____:#liferay> got a portlet with some webservices using SSO-token for Authentication, might be some issues with Cookie domains there
16:00 < kim____:#liferay> I'm able to login using SSO
16:01 <@jhf:#liferay> is the portlet making the call to the web services from the server side, or client side?
16:02 < kim____:#liferay> server-side
16:09 <@jhf:#liferay> I've never done that before - you'd have to make the call from your java code (on Liferay server) to the external server, and add the necessary authorization headers, which I'm not sure is possible since the authorization headers are only good when the call is coming from the client.. I think
16:09 <@jhf:#liferay> in other words, the liferay server isn't SSO-signed in, only the user is. I think that's how it works. I could be wrong.
16:20 < kim____:#liferay> you might be correct
