05:07 < Axxell:#liferay> Hey guys, trying to get my theme to load fast and get a better performance grade.. css and jss files are in 9 seperate files, i do have in ext-portal.properties javascript.fast.load=true theme.css.fast.load=true, but still these 9 files do not combine? How do i do that?
05:20 < Axxell:#liferay> anyone?
05:31 < Axxell:#liferay> yslow says that its 12js files and 10css files... is there anyway to force them to combine
06:45 < Axxell:#liferay> please help fellow mamals!
09:08 < modd_:#liferay> hi there
09:10 < modd_:#liferay> I have a LR6.0.6 here which should use users.email.address.required=false
09:11 < modd_:#liferay> and it works, I can create users without email
09:11 < modd_:#liferay> but if these users try to login, they have to add an email or they can't do anything
09:11 < modd_:#liferay> seems like it recognize an email with the given suffix as invalid :\
09:18 < modd_:#liferay> found a ticket: https://support.liferay.com/browse/LPS-21083

13:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, why were they tuned off?
13:02 <@jhf:#liferay> lack of care and feeding
13:05 <@jhf:#liferay> no one turned it off, it just quietly died :)
13:05 <@jhf:#liferay> (presumably someone changed a script somewhere in the build system, and didn't think about the impact on the nightlies)
13:05 <@jhf:#liferay> dang script kiddies
14:52 < kim____:#liferay> How can i debug sso issues? "10.241.42.32
14:52 < kim____:#liferay> -ip
14:52 < kim____:#liferay> "Liferay has failed to connect to the OpenSSO server. Please check your configuration and verify that the OpenSSO server is running."
14:57 <@jhf:#liferay> kim____: turn on debugging via Control Panel -> Server Administration -> Log Levels
14:58 <@jhf:#liferay> for log com.liferay.portal.security.auth and com.liferay.portal.servlet.filters.sso turn them both to the ALL log level
14:58 <@jhf:#liferay> (add them if those two loggers aren't listed on the log levels screen)
