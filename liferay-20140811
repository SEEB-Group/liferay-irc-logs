07:58 < Axxell:#liferay> any help would be appreciated
09:33 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik, you there?
09:35 < topolik:#liferay> jardineworks: yup
09:35 < jardineworks:#liferay> praise the lord! I need you help.
09:35 < jardineworks:#liferay> I have something that is driving me bananas. I actually had a temper tantrum yesterday :)
09:35 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik, background:
09:36 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik, Some crazy requirement to have PRECISION expiration on content. So basically, if I say that this thing expires at 10:04am, then that is exactly when the content expires. I know you can set the CheckArticle job to run every minute but there were concerns over load.
09:37 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik, So I created a few hooks/control panel portlets that basically allow you, when scheduling content, to specify that you want a "precision expiration" ... and if checked a Quartz job is created and scheduled when saving that is specific to the expiration of the content.
