03:20 < winem_:#liferay> morning
04:13 < winem_:#liferay> has anyone experience with liferay + one-page-design?
07:10 < Axxell:#liferay> Hey guys, im wondering if there is a way to embed a portlet into a application display template?
07:26 < Axxell:#liferay> i can embed into a webcontent portlets, but what i want to do is embed it in any application display template, in this case i want to embed a assetpubliser in a assetpublisher
07:58 < Axxell:#liferay> any help would be appreciated
09:33 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik, you there?
09:35 < topolik:#liferay> jardineworks: yup
09:35 < jardineworks:#liferay> praise the lord! I need you help.
09:35 < jardineworks:#liferay> I have something that is driving me bananas. I actually had a temper tantrum yesterday :)
09:35 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik, background:
09:36 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik, Some crazy requirement to have PRECISION expiration on content. So basically, if I say that this thing expires at 10:04am, then that is exactly when the content expires. I know you can set the CheckArticle job to run every minute but there were concerns over load.
09:37 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik, So I created a few hooks/control panel portlets that basically allow you, when scheduling content, to specify that you want a "precision expiration" ... and if checked a Quartz job is created and scheduled when saving that is specific to the expiration of the content.
09:38 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik, I have a few odd things happening, most of them problematic only in a cluster environment.
09:39 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik, First of all, I have two detination names I use -- the one for "expire jobs" is precision_expire
09:40 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik, if I add 3 articles... all set to expire at 10:02am lets say. In a non-clustered environment, all three fire, but the first seems to fire 3x, the 2nd 2x, the 3rd 1x.
09:40 < jardineworks:#liferay> I don't really understand why to be honest.
09:41 < topolik:#liferay> hmm, how do you select which articles to expire?
09:41 < jardineworks:#liferay> but that I can fix with specific destination names per job (destination name + job name for example). The bigger issue is that some of the jobs don't appear to fire when they are supposed to. I think they are trigger misfires.
09:41 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik, you know the "schedule" page for a piece of content?
09:42 < topolik:#liferay> well, we met, but no serious relationship ;)
09:42 < jardineworks:#liferay> I wrote a JSP hook that adds a checkbox with two text fields, name and description. If the user checks the box then in the CustomEditArticleAction I execute the logic to create a specific job for that piece of content.
09:42 < jardineworks:#liferay> haha
09:43 < jardineworks:#liferay> there are several things that I can't figure out. For starters, what is the polling class that checks to the triggers to see if they should be fired?
09:45 < jardineworks:#liferay> I see a few classes with Poller in the name, and a spring config with the same... but not sure if they are the ones.
09:45 < jardineworks:#liferay> (also Liferay 6.1.1 ce)
