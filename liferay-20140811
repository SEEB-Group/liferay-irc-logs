03:20 < winem_:#liferay> morning
04:13 < winem_:#liferay> has anyone experience with liferay + one-page-design?
07:10 < Axxell:#liferay> Hey guys, im wondering if there is a way to embed a portlet into a application display template?
07:26 < Axxell:#liferay> i can embed into a webcontent portlets, but what i want to do is embed it in any application display template, in this case i want to embed a assetpubliser in a assetpublisher
07:58 < Axxell:#liferay> any help would be appreciated
09:33 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik, you there?
09:35 < topolik:#liferay> jardineworks: yup
09:35 < jardineworks:#liferay> praise the lord! I need you help.
09:35 < jardineworks:#liferay> I have something that is driving me bananas. I actually had a temper tantrum yesterday :)
09:35 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik, background:
09:36 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik, Some crazy requirement to have PRECISION expiration on content. So basically, if I say that this thing expires at 10:04am, then that is exactly when the content expires. I know you can set the CheckArticle job to run every minute but there were concerns over load.
09:37 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik, So I created a few hooks/control panel portlets that basically allow you, when scheduling content, to specify that you want a "precision expiration" ... and if checked a Quartz job is created and scheduled when saving that is specific to the expiration of the content.
09:38 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik, I have a few odd things happening, most of them problematic only in a cluster environment.
09:39 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik, First of all, I have two detination names I use -- the one for "expire jobs" is precision_expire
09:40 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik, if I add 3 articles... all set to expire at 10:02am lets say. In a non-clustered environment, all three fire, but the first seems to fire 3x, the 2nd 2x, the 3rd 1x.
09:40 < jardineworks:#liferay> I don't really understand why to be honest.
09:41 < topolik:#liferay> hmm, how do you select which articles to expire?
09:41 < jardineworks:#liferay> but that I can fix with specific destination names per job (destination name + job name for example). The bigger issue is that some of the jobs don't appear to fire when they are supposed to. I think they are trigger misfires.
09:41 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik, you know the "schedule" page for a piece of content?
09:42 < topolik:#liferay> well, we met, but no serious relationship ;)
09:42 < jardineworks:#liferay> I wrote a JSP hook that adds a checkbox with two text fields, name and description. If the user checks the box then in the CustomEditArticleAction I execute the logic to create a specific job for that piece of content.
09:42 < jardineworks:#liferay> haha
09:43 < jardineworks:#liferay> there are several things that I can't figure out. For starters, what is the polling class that checks to the triggers to see if they should be fired?
09:45 < jardineworks:#liferay> I see a few classes with Poller in the name, and a spring config with the same... but not sure if they are the ones.
09:45 < jardineworks:#liferay> (also Liferay 6.1.1 ce)
09:48 < topolik:#liferay> hmm, I guess it's Quartz that is responsible for the scheduling & firing jobs
09:50 < jardineworks:#liferay> do you have a few minutes for me to show you in mikogo?
09:54 < topolik:#liferay> ok
09:54 < topolik:#liferay> let me install it
09:58 < topolik:#liferay> jardineworks: I'm ready
10:02 < jardineworks:#liferay> k
10:02 < jardineworks:#liferay> sending you a pm
10:02 < jardineworks:#liferay> (from aj_)
10:06 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik, sent

10:10 <@jhf:#liferay> hey jardineworks
10:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, \o/
10:11 <@jhf:#liferay> I have some good news for you
10:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> I like good news
10:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> :)
10:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> especially on MOndays
10:12 <@jhf:#liferay> if you’re still interested in doing something related to Lucene/Solr on your dev.life session, the developer who originally signed up for it has changed his mind, so you are free to tackle that on October 21st!
10:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> oh
10:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> I didn't even know someone else was doign it
10:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> I thought it was me
10:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> lol
10:13 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, wait, if that is new, then what did you have me penciled in for?
10:13 <@jhf:#liferay> OpenSearch
10:14 < jardineworks:#liferay> OpenSearch is related though :)
10:14 <@jhf:#liferay> oh wait
10:14 <@jhf:#liferay> I’m confused
10:14 < jardineworks:#liferay> lol
10:14 < jardineworks:#liferay> OpenSearch is the standard... I was just going to show how you can use it to search both your custom entities and external ones using the "Search" (federated search) portlet.
10:15 < jardineworks:#liferay> which meant Lucene for me... because I don't have the SOLR stuff done.
10:15 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah, that’s cool.. for some reason I thought you wanted to do Lucene/Solr but you were interested in ADT
10:15 <@jhf:#liferay> so.. carry on, nothing to see here :/
10:15 < jardineworks:#liferay> yeah -- but you said one of your crew was doing that one :)
10:16 < jardineworks:#liferay> bah! way to get me all worked up over some exciting news and then just stare at me.
10:16 <@jhf:#liferay> well we are designing a custom tee shirt for all session leaders, if that’s any consolation :)
10:17 < jardineworks:#liferay> sweet! though, being in Canada, I would request a hoodie -- just sayin'
10:19 <@jhf:#liferay> hoodie on request
10:19 <@jhf:#liferay> (meaning, it is on request, not that you can get one by requesting it)
10:20 <@jhf:#liferay> :)
10:22 < jardineworks:#liferay> haha

19:54 < bijoo_:#liferay> winem_: yes, have had Liferay one-page design exp.
19:55 < bijoo_:#liferay> Axxell: you can try same approach as web content; have you tried that or just asking here? I've not had to embed in ADT.
21:46 < jrmiah:#liferay> ran ant deploy in the samples-jsp-portlets directory of the plugins project on github; was this portlet supposed to automagically appear in the running portal? a search for its title (via portlet.xml) provided nada
21:48 < jrmiah:#liferay> my bad just saw that this version of the portlet doesnt support this version of liferay hah
