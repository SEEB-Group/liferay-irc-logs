04:05 < modd> hi
06:13 < sm`> hello
06:14 < sm`> does anyone have any resource for creating JSONWebService without using Service Builder
06:14 < sm`> http://www.liferay.com/community/forums/-/message_boards/message/36741036
06:14 < sm`> i got stuck with using ServiceBuilder cuz the generated stuff (spring conf topolik suggested) is colliding with my custom
06:14 < sm`> spring configuration
06:15 < sm`> my spring+hibernate configuratioN*
06:15 < topolik> sm`: Hi, I thought about it and there is no other exception in spring registration, right?
06:16 < sm`> no just those 2
06:16 < sm`> however i noticed another thing
06:16 < sm`> i have <listener-class>org.springframework.web.context.ContextLoaderListener</listener-class> in my web.xml
06:17 < sm`> i found some suggestions on the forum
06:17 < sm`> to use <listener-class>com.liferay.portal.kernel.spring.context.PortletContextLoaderListener</listener-class>
06:18 < topolik> the PortletContextLoaderListener should be added during auto deploy
06:18 < sm`> but when i do this, my portlet is not working ie my appcontext is not loaded corectly
06:20 < topolik> PortletContextLoaderListener is responsible to init the spring context
06:20 < topolik> but it inits the context from the service builder files
06:20 < topolik> on the other hand, ContextLoaderListener should initialize from your app XML
06:20 < topolik> so I guess there is a conflict in the initialization
06:21 < topolik> (there can be only one root spring context)
06:21 < sm`> i moved my spring conf in ext-spring.xml
06:21 < sm`> and it loads fine from there too
06:21 < sm`> the portlet is working fine
06:21 < sm`> but the jsonws still throws the same exception
06:21 < topolik> and you kept the ContextLoaderListener in web.xml?
06:22 < sm`> nope removed it
06:22 < topolik> ok
06:22 < sm`> i thought the service builder will load it
06:22 < sm`> and it did
06:22 < topolik> ok
06:22 < sm`> but there is still some other problem
06:23 < sm`> thats why i thought that maybe i should go and do everything manually
