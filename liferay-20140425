03:57 < twen> 'morning
04:05 < modd> hi
06:13 < sm`> hello
06:14 < sm`> does anyone have any resource for creating JSONWebService without using Service Builder
06:14 < sm`> http://www.liferay.com/community/forums/-/message_boards/message/36741036
06:14 < sm`> i got stuck with using ServiceBuilder cuz the generated stuff (spring conf topolik suggested) is colliding with my custom
06:14 < sm`> spring configuration
06:15 < sm`> my spring+hibernate configuratioN*
06:15 < topolik> sm`: Hi, I thought about it and there is no other exception in spring registration, right?
06:16 < sm`> no just those 2
06:16 < sm`> however i noticed another thing
06:16 < sm`> i have <listener-class>org.springframework.web.context.ContextLoaderListener</listener-class> in my web.xml
06:17 < sm`> i found some suggestions on the forum
06:17 < sm`> to use <listener-class>com.liferay.portal.kernel.spring.context.PortletContextLoaderListener</listener-class>
06:18 < topolik> the PortletContextLoaderListener should be added during auto deploy
06:18 < sm`> but when i do this, my portlet is not working ie my appcontext is not loaded corectly
06:20 < topolik> PortletContextLoaderListener is responsible to init the spring context
06:20 < topolik> but it inits the context from the service builder files
06:20 < topolik> on the other hand, ContextLoaderListener should initialize from your app XML
06:20 < topolik> so I guess there is a conflict in the initialization
06:21 < topolik> (there can be only one root spring context)
06:21 < sm`> i moved my spring conf in ext-spring.xml
06:21 < sm`> and it loads fine from there too
06:21 < sm`> the portlet is working fine
06:21 < sm`> but the jsonws still throws the same exception
06:21 < topolik> and you kept the ContextLoaderListener in web.xml?
06:22 < sm`> nope removed it
06:22 < topolik> ok
06:22 < sm`> i thought the service builder will load it
06:22 < sm`> and it did
06:22 < topolik> ok
06:22 < sm`> but there is still some other problem
06:23 < sm`> thats why i thought that maybe i should go and do everything manually
06:23 < sm`> create my own Service and ServiceImpl @JSONWebService classes
06:25 < topolik> uhm, it should work OOTB
06:26 < topolik> and you still get the same exception - that bean locator is not set?
06:27 < topolik> because now it should be set when ServiceBuilder is initialized (at least with our beans)
06:27 < topolik> *our = your :D
06:27 < sm``> yes
06:27 < sm``> {"exception":"com.liferay.portal.kernel.bean.BeanLocatorException: BeanLocator has not been set for servlet context StoreFinder-portlet"}
06:28 < sm``> and also INFO   | jvm 1    | 2014/04/25 11:43:26 | SEVERE: ClassNotFoundException while loading persisted sessions: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: com.liferay.portal.model.impl.UserImpl
06:28 < sm``> on restart
06:29 < topolik> hmm, ok, let's try to solve this one, just in case it has something in common
06:30 < topolik> I think tomcat is saving existing sessions into some files somewhere so that they persist restarts
06:31 < topolik> yeah, SESSIONS.ser - https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/config/manager.html
06:31 < topolik> is it possible for you to delete the file?
06:31 < sm`> yes
06:31 < sm`> at least on the developent server
06:39 < sm`> find . -name 'SESSIONS.ser'
06:39 < sm`> ./tomcat-7.0.27.mac/work/Catalina/localhost/StoreFinder-portlet/SESSIONS.ser
06:40 < sm`> let me remove that one
06:40 < sm`> and start the tomcat again
06:42 < sm`> that fixed the exceptions on statup
06:42 < sm`> u were right
06:42 < sm`> tnx
06:43 < sm`> but the problem with the jsonws is still there
06:43 < sm`> damn.
06:44 < topolik> ok, at least we know it's not related :)
06:45 < sm`> haha
06:45 < sm`> true
06:47 < topolik> can you please share content of the service.properties, all the spring config files and deployed web.xml (the rewritten one)?
06:49 < sm`> web.xml, the one after deployment or my latest?
06:52 < sm`> nvm
06:52 < sm`> let me pastebin
06:53 < sm`> service.properties, ext-spring.xml, web.xml - http://pastebin.com/jgZQUrsM
06:53 < sm`> shall i pastebin the other generated by service builder such as base-spring, cluster-spring, hibernate-spring etc. ?
06:55 < modd> will journalarticlelocalserviceutil.getarticlebyresourceprimkey always return the list sorted by version desc? I can't find the service.xml for this service
06:57 < topolik> sm`: I see you still have org.springframework.web.context.ContextLoaderListener in the web.xml
06:57 < topolik> and yes, I meant the one inside tomcat, after deployment
07:02 < sm`> yes i do... shall i remove it?
07:04 < sm`> let me try that and then paste the deployed web.xml
07:09 < sm`> how the @JSONWebService
07:09 < sm`> is not scanned
07:10 < sm`> the webserivces are not listed on /StoreFinder-portlet/api/jsonws
07:10 < sm`> after i removed the ContextLoaderListener
07:12 < sm`> and heres the deployed web.xml
