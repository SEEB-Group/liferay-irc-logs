09:44 < sm`:#liferay> Hello
09:44 < sm`:#liferay> how do i get the text from <option> field
09:44 < sm`:#liferay> in the processAction method?
09:44 < sm`:#liferay> i seems ParamUtil.getString(field, request) returns the 'value' tag
09:45 < sm`:#liferay> nad i need the text
10:14 < topolik:#liferay> Hi, the option text/label is not submitted by the HTML form => you cannot read it from the request
10:15 < topolik:#liferay> but you could use JavaScript to copy the text into a hidden input when the <option> is selected ... hint: <select onchange=...>
13:40 < bijoo__:#liferay> rocknrol1_ need to define in portlet.xml
