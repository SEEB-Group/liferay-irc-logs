00:00 < bradley:#liferay> is it possible to add css to a layout template?
00:09 < bijoo_:#liferay> bradley: probably not since it's only layout; also no fields for that in (com.liferay.portal.model.LayoutTemplatecom.liferay.portal.model.LayoutTemplatecom.liferay.portal.model.LayoutTemplate) and/or in (file:///opt/lr/62rc6/liferay-portal-src-6.2.0-ce-rc6/definitions/liferay-layout-templates_6_2_0.dtd )
00:10 < bradley:#liferay> I'm saying you should be able to add a main.css file like any other plugin
00:10 < bradley:#liferay> because if you have an external layout
00:10 < bradley:#liferay> then you might need styles that will work with any theme
00:11 < bijoo_:#liferay> "Layout Templates allow you to choose how portlets will be arranged on a page. They are simple table or CSS-based containers into which portlets can be dropped and sit within the body of the page. Liferay Portal comes with several built-in layout templates, but if you require a more complex page layout you may wish to use this custom layout template. A thumbnail is displayed when the end user clicks Layout Template from the Dock menu. C
00:12 < bradley:#liferay> I'm creating a custom layout
00:13 < bradley:#liferay> I had to put css styles at the top of the .tpl files
00:13 < bradley:#liferay> such as .full-width .portlet-body #main { padding-left:0; padding-right:0;}
00:13 < bijoo_:#liferay> bradley: okay, I see; my mistake there my friend.
00:14 < bijoo_:#liferay> bradley: I know what you mean now; yea, that makes sense.
00:16 < bijoo_:#liferay> bradley: you may be able to add one from there; since it'll live in servlet context, correct? Just that portal won't minimize it there.
00:28 < bradley:#liferay> ya
00:28 < bradley:#liferay> I'm working on maven so it gets a little tricky parsing the sass
02:10 < Axxell:#liferay> continiuing from yesterday: trying to compile https://github.com/arcusys/liferay-vaadin-plugin with maven, using maven for the first time. Still using the instructions provided on that page, will not compile the plugin. If i use the option -llr it starts to compile but gets problems with liferay portal-impl.jar
02:10 < Axxell:#liferay> it seems that a liferay.version=6.2.0 does not exist
02:10 < Axxell:#liferay> what seems to exist is liferay.version=6.2.0-RC5
02:11 < Axxell:#liferay> nor does liferay.version=6.2.0-ga1 exist
02:23 < Axxell:#liferay> i do believe it tries to download from the official maven repository, but i havent found info yet how to configure it to use another repository, maybe liferay has its own?
02:32 < Axxell:#liferay> ok so the official maven repo only has liferay 6.2.0-rc5 jars, but if use the following profile with the url to the liferay repo, it compiles ok http://pastebin.com/C1BDbGCZ
04:44 < Axxell:#liferay> so has somebody tried to get vaadin 7 to work on liferay 6.2? Im trying to get a liferay IDE created vaadin portlet to work... i got it to compile but it seems that it killed liferay 500 error
04:49 < Rajesh:#liferay> Hello friends
04:50 < Guest65878:#liferay> can you please tell me, how to add set  portlet for an organization?
04:51 < Guest65878:#liferay> I wanna to assign a specific portlet to specific organization.
04:51 < Guest65878:#liferay> please help me
05:09 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> hi, has anyone used jbpm in liferay?
05:10 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> Guest65878, from my knowledge, there is no way to do that. instead you can set the site containing that portlet as the organization's private site.
05:18 < Guest65878:#liferay> what is jbpm?
05:22 < Guest65878:#liferay> how to set a portlet for a specific user login ?
05:27 < Datatreis:#liferay> hi friends
05:28 < Datatreis:#liferay> can you please tell me how to assign a portlet to users
05:30 < Datatreis:#liferay> I have list of portlet and want  to give access to user lohgin in liferay.
09:21 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> anyone there?
09:24 < dave_k:#liferay> Hey all ... I'm looking for ideas to deliver requests for /apple-touch-icon-precomposed.png via liferay or tomcat. would it be better in the theme or statically configured?
09:25 < dave_k:#liferay> (oh ... it's for liferay 6.1.0)
09:28 <@jhf:#liferay> hey bijoo
10:00 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey guys
10:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> I have an awesome puzzle if anyone is up for a brain melter.
10:01 <@jhf:#liferay> uh oh
10:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> I have two pages -- both pages have the exact same portlet configuration (I know, terrible, not my doing)
10:01 <@jhf:#liferay> btw if anyone is interested in getting notified of new and exciting Liferay Marketplace apps, follow @LiferayApps on twitter. we just set this up yesterday.
10:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> The three portlets. -- one web content display, one "custom search results" and one "reated products"
10:02 < jardineworks:#liferay> the page itself is driven by a tag -- so for eaxmple page A is "Gluten-Free"  page B is "Vegetarian"
10:03 < jardineworks:#liferay> in the theme for my site I have a portlet embedded. When you click a link in the nav (where it is embedded) an overlay displays. As part of this process a AJAX call to the embedded portlet is made.
10:03 < jardineworks:#liferay> this works without issue on all pages -- EXCEPT the Vegetarian page.
10:03 < jardineworks:#liferay> on that page I get a 400 nad request
10:03 < jardineworks:#liferay> and my AJAX call of course never completes.
10:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> I checked the urls... and they ae identical, save the layout name (gluten-free vs. vegetarian)
10:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> The code that makes the ajax call is a JS function and is the same function for all of these calls.
10:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> Questions --
10:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> 1/ has anyone seen something like this before?
10:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> 2/ does anyone know how I can get more details from a 400 server error?
10:05 <@jhf:#liferay> this should be easy to debug
10:05 <@jhf:#liferay> first, any errors in the tomcat log?
10:06 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, one sec
10:06 < jardineworks:#liferay> I don't think so, but I might be looking in the wrong place
10:07 < jardineworks:#liferay> i just realized I am tailing catalina.out which is probably wrong
10:08 <@jhf:#liferay> no that's the right log file
10:08 <@jhf:#liferay> anyway, if no errors then can you open "chrome developer tools" in chrome (or firebug in firefox)?
10:08 <@jhf:#liferay> you can see the actual url that the ajax call tries to request, the headers sent and received, etc
10:08 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf,  nothing in the log
10:09 <@jhf:#liferay> if you are using IE then you're dead to me
10:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> haha
10:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> linux
10:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> no ie
10:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> windows is dead to me
10:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> here is the 400 bad error link.. (it happens for two of the four vegetarian and this one)
10:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> http://sprouts.twelpful.net/topics/sprouts-brand?p_p_id=shoppinglist_WAR_shoppinglistportlet&p_p_lifecycle=2&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&p_p_resource_id=getShoppingListItem&p_p_cacheability=cacheLevelPage&no_cache=1390489556867
10:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> and the only difference is the /topics/[topic-name]
10:10 <@jhf:#liferay> when I click that URL it asks me for http basic auth username/password
10:10 <@jhf:#liferay> oh you're just saying thats the url
10:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> right
10:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> because the server is protected
10:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> I'm not sure what I should be looking for in the headers... it all looks fine to me
