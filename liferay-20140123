00:00 < bradley:#liferay> is it possible to add css to a layout template?
00:09 < bijoo_:#liferay> bradley: probably not since it's only layout; also no fields for that in (com.liferay.portal.model.LayoutTemplatecom.liferay.portal.model.LayoutTemplatecom.liferay.portal.model.LayoutTemplate) and/or in (file:///opt/lr/62rc6/liferay-portal-src-6.2.0-ce-rc6/definitions/liferay-layout-templates_6_2_0.dtd )
00:10 < bradley:#liferay> I'm saying you should be able to add a main.css file like any other plugin
00:10 < bradley:#liferay> because if you have an external layout
00:10 < bradley:#liferay> then you might need styles that will work with any theme
00:11 < bijoo_:#liferay> "Layout Templates allow you to choose how portlets will be arranged on a page. They are simple table or CSS-based containers into which portlets can be dropped and sit within the body of the page. Liferay Portal comes with several built-in layout templates, but if you require a more complex page layout you may wish to use this custom layout template. A thumbnail is displayed when the end user clicks Layout Template from the Dock menu. C
00:12 < bradley:#liferay> I'm creating a custom layout
00:13 < bradley:#liferay> I had to put css styles at the top of the .tpl files
00:13 < bradley:#liferay> such as .full-width .portlet-body #main { padding-left:0; padding-right:0;}
00:13 < bijoo_:#liferay> bradley: okay, I see; my mistake there my friend.
00:14 < bijoo_:#liferay> bradley: I know what you mean now; yea, that makes sense.
00:16 < bijoo_:#liferay> bradley: you may be able to add one from there; since it'll live in servlet context, correct? Just that portal won't minimize it there.
00:28 < bradley:#liferay> ya
00:28 < bradley:#liferay> I'm working on maven so it gets a little tricky parsing the sass
02:10 < Axxell:#liferay> continiuing from yesterday: trying to compile https://github.com/arcusys/liferay-vaadin-plugin with maven, using maven for the first time. Still using the instructions provided on that page, will not compile the plugin. If i use the option -llr it starts to compile but gets problems with liferay portal-impl.jar
02:10 < Axxell:#liferay> it seems that a liferay.version=6.2.0 does not exist
02:10 < Axxell:#liferay> what seems to exist is liferay.version=6.2.0-RC5
02:11 < Axxell:#liferay> nor does liferay.version=6.2.0-ga1 exist
02:23 < Axxell:#liferay> i do believe it tries to download from the official maven repository, but i havent found info yet how to configure it to use another repository, maybe liferay has its own?
02:32 < Axxell:#liferay> ok so the official maven repo only has liferay 6.2.0-rc5 jars, but if use the following profile with the url to the liferay repo, it compiles ok http://pastebin.com/C1BDbGCZ
04:44 < Axxell:#liferay> so has somebody tried to get vaadin 7 to work on liferay 6.2? Im trying to get a liferay IDE created vaadin portlet to work... i got it to compile but it seems that it killed liferay 500 error

05:09 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> hi, has anyone used jbpm in liferay?
05:10 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> Guest65878, from my knowledge, there is no way to do that. instead you can set the site containing that portlet as the organization's private site.
