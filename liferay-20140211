02:54 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> *sigh* Sometimes good intentions are the direct opposite of good.

07:36 < jardineworks:#liferay> good morning guys
08:29 < modd_:#liferay> jhf: liferay has serious problems with url-changes. all old community portlet urls are down (ok, it doesn't exist anymore) but also a lot of documentation links are down (check the documentation links of your 6.2 blog entry)
08:40 < AhmadElMelegy:#liferay> Is there a Question&Answers portlet like stackoverflow or askubuntu ?
08:44 < modd_:#liferay> the forum portlet
09:40 <@jhf:#liferay> hey mod
09:41 <@jhf:#liferay> well he's gone. dang.

09:52 < bodik:#liferay> hi
09:52 < cr3:#liferay> hi folks, I'd like to write junit tests for the models of a liferay portlet but I don't know where to start. for example, where should I put the files, under ./docroot/WEB-INF/test or ./docroot/tests or somewhere else?
09:52 < bodik:#liferay> is there something like "pastebin portlet" ? i cannt find anything like that ...
10:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> cr3, I think it's more a case of preference than requirement. I personally put them under WEB-INF/src/test
10:02 < jardineworks:#liferay> bodik, I've never seen a pastebin portlet. YOu could fake it though by allowing guest users to create web content and then using the asset publisher to show them.
10:02 < jardineworks:#liferay> probably not what you want (ultimately) but it'd be a place to start.
10:03 < cr3:#liferay> jardineworks: I haven't done any junit testing though, so I'd like to adopt a directory that people are likely to find easily :)
10:05 < bodik:#liferay> jardineworks: thanks
10:05 < bodik:#liferay> jardineworks: si think i have to create one by myself ;|
10:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> cr3, I think the convention is driven by maven style projects which usually use src/main/ for the main source tree and src/test for the unit test branch.
10:11 < cr3:#liferay> jardineworks: I'm still using ant but I'd like to eventually migrate to maven, so I should probably adopt maven practices in preparation for the future
10:14 < jardineworks:#liferay> cr3, I'm an ANT guy myself (for Liferay) but the structure for maven is one that I have adopted because I think it makes sense.
12:40 < AhmadElMelegy:#liferay> Is there a Question&Answers portlet like stackoverflow or askubuntu ?
12:43 <@jhf:#liferay> AhmadElMelegy: yes, the "Message Boards" portlet is the closest
12:43 < AhmadElMelegy:#liferay> how can I edit it to rename the buttons etc..
12:49 < AhmadElMelegy:#liferay> please anyone can help ?
12:50 <@jhf:#liferay> AhmadElMelegy: if you want to change what the buttons say, you can override its JSPs using a "Hook" plugin
12:51 < AhmadElMelegy:#liferay> is there any tutorial about something like that ?
12:52 <@jhf:#liferay> https://www.liferay.com/web/raymond.auge/blog/-/blogs/jsp-include-buffer
12:53 <@jhf:#liferay> also, the official docs: https://www.liferay.com/documentation/liferay-portal/6.2/development/-/ai/customizing-jsps-by-extending-the-original
12:58 < AhmadElMelegy:#liferay> thank you very much :)
13:01 <@jhf:#liferay> no problem, that is a very common thing to want to do, so there are lots of examples around
13:04 < AhmadElMelegy:#liferay> jhf: I am new to liferay, Can you show me an open-source example of this please
13:08 <@jhf:#liferay> here is a step-by-step guide for creating a hook: http://www.opensourceforlife.com/2012/07/create-liferay-hook-using-liferay-ide.html
13:08 <@jhf:#liferay> I would work through that first, and ensure it "works"
13:13 < AhmadElMelegy:#liferay> thanks, I'll be back if something went wrong :)
13:13 <@jhf:#liferay> k
13:13 <@jhf:#liferay> just FYI, the basic idea is that the built-in message boards portlet consists of a bunch of JSPs. you can "override" any of the JSPs to change anything in there.
13:14 <@jhf:#liferay> so for example, a JSP might declare a button like <aui:button type="submit" value="move-thread" />
13:15 <@jhf:#liferay> you can override the jsp by copying the original code, and changing it to something like                 <aui:button type="submit" value="MOVE IT" />
13:15 <@jhf:#liferay> to change the text (but not the behavior) on the button
13:22 < AhmadElMelegy:#liferay> great, but where I can found the original code of message boards portlet ?
13:42 < bijoo_:#liferay> AhmadElMelegy: https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/
13:42 < bijoo_:#liferay> AhmadElMelegy: are you familiar with GitHub there?
13:43 < AhmadElMelegy:#liferay> yes, but where specifically is the "Message Boards" in these directories ?
13:44 < AhmadElMelegy:#liferay> bijoo
13:46 < bijoo_:#liferay> AhmadElMelegy: it's in portal-web/html/portlet/messageboards
13:46 < bijoo_:#liferay> AhmadElMelegy: note you'll have to select the right version
13:47 < bijoo_:#liferay> AhmadElMelegy: you can clone the repo, it's easy then; it will take about 4.5 GB
13:50 < AhmadElMelegy:#liferay> it this valid for LifeRay 6.2 CE GA1 ?
13:51 < AhmadElMelegy:#liferay> https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/tree/master/portal-web/docroot/html/portlet/message_boards
13:57 < modd:#liferay> AhmadElMelegy: message boards are part of the default installation
13:57 < modd:#liferay> so you have it already in your portal
13:58 < AhmadElMelegy:#liferay> The original code is in the installation ?
14:03 < modd:#liferay> the whole portlet is in it
14:04 < modd:#liferay> go to any page and open the add-menu on the left side
14:04 < modd:#liferay> then switch to the portlet tab or how it's called
14:04 < modd:#liferay> and type message board into the searchbox
14:17 < AhmadElMelegy:#liferay> I want to edit it, modd
14:18 < modd:#liferay> you can hook it
14:19 < bijoo_:#liferay> AhmadElMelegy: so yes, modd is correct as well here; the code for the JSPs are here: (assuming you are using tomcat there) ${CATALINA_HOME}/webapps/ROOT/html/portlets/messageboards/
14:20 < bijoo_:#liferay> AhmadElMelegy: but to answer your question, no, that's not; but all you have to do is select "tag" : https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/tree/6.1.1-ga2/portal-web/docroot/html/portlet/message_boards
14:20 < bijoo_:#liferay> whoops that's the link for 6.1.1 GA2
14:21 < bijoo_:#liferay> 6.2.0-GA1 is here:
14:21 < bijoo_:#liferay> https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/tree/6.2.0-ga1/portal-web/docroot/html/portlet/message_boards
14:22 < AhmadElMelegy:#liferay> ok thanks :)
