02:54 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> *sigh* Sometimes good intentions are the direct opposite of good.

07:36 < jardineworks:#liferay> good morning guys
08:29 < modd_:#liferay> jhf: liferay has serious problems with url-changes. all old community portlet urls are down (ok, it doesn't exist anymore) but also a lot of documentation links are down (check the documentation links of your 6.2 blog entry)
08:40 < AhmadElMelegy:#liferay> Is there a Question&Answers portlet like stackoverflow or askubuntu ?
08:44 < modd_:#liferay> the forum portlet
09:40 <@jhf:#liferay> hey mod
09:41 <@jhf:#liferay> well he's gone. dang.

09:52 < bodik:#liferay> hi
09:52 < cr3:#liferay> hi folks, I'd like to write junit tests for the models of a liferay portlet but I don't know where to start. for example, where should I put the files, under ./docroot/WEB-INF/test or ./docroot/tests or somewhere else?
09:52 < bodik:#liferay> is there something like "pastebin portlet" ? i cannt find anything like that ...
10:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> cr3, I think it's more a case of preference than requirement. I personally put them under WEB-INF/src/test
10:02 < jardineworks:#liferay> bodik, I've never seen a pastebin portlet. YOu could fake it though by allowing guest users to create web content and then using the asset publisher to show them.
10:02 < jardineworks:#liferay> probably not what you want (ultimately) but it'd be a place to start.
