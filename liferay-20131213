03:43 < hufg:#liferay> what is the document library file rank?
03:50 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Good morning.
04:16 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Hey guys...has anyone of you every used /c/journal/view_article_content?
04:17 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> In 6.1.0 we were using &version=latest, but apparently this is being ignored on 6.1.2
04:17 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> "latest" doesn't work any more. I can only use an actual version number.
04:17 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Any ideas how I could get the latest version this way?
09:14 < bjornjohansson:#liferay> Can I force liferay to recreate the previews from Open Office?
09:14 < bjornjohansson:#liferay> My fonts is corrupt, even though I just installed ImageMagick
09:14 < bjornjohansson:#liferay> Perhaps some font is missing?
09:14 < bjornjohansson:#liferay> (I run liferay as a service in Windows)
09:15 < bjornjohansson:#liferay> I tried to use the functions under "Server Administration"
09:27 < bjornjohansson:#liferay> found it..
09:27 < bjornjohansson:#liferay> :)
09:30 < bjornjohansson:#liferay> I didn't read everything under Server Administration
09:35 < bjornjohansson:#liferay> Where are the previews stored?
10:10 < bjornjohansson:#liferay> found that as well
10:10 < bjornjohansson:#liferay> now I have to leave :)
