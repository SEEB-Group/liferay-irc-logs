05:25 < Bilou:#liferay> Hi, im new in liferay world, and i need some councils to start developping in this technologie. by what i soulad start please.
08:28 < goku_:#liferay> Hi,How to add a new field in user creation page ,along with other pages and it should get added to a seperate table , is that possible to do this with hooks?
08:28 < goku_:#liferay> *along with other params
09:06 < jardineworks_:#liferay> goku_, do you mean in the user (self) registration page? or do you mean in the control panel?
09:07 < goku_:#liferay> jardineworks_, i need one extra param in user_edit.jsp and save that new param in different table
09:09 < goku_:#liferay> jardineworks_, if i edit that jsp page the new param will come in the add page in control panel right?
09:09 < jardineworks_:#liferay> goku_, ok -- so you would use a JSP hook to add that field... and then you need to create a StrutsAction (Portlet I think) hook to "augment" the save action. EditUserAction I think is the class for the strts action.
09:09 < jardineworks_:#liferay> goku_, yep.
09:10 < jardineworks_:#liferay> and then for the save, you basically copy the EditUserAction -- let it do whatever it does now, but at the end of the "save" steps, add in the ones for your own -- save it to an expando, or external database, call a service, whatever.
09:11 < jardineworks_:#liferay> goku_, I think you dropped before this came throuhg.
09:11 < jardineworks_:#liferay> and then for the save, you basically copy the EditUserAction -- let it do whatever it does now, but at the end of the "save" steps, add in the ones for your own -- save it to an expando, or external database, call a service, whatever.
09:12 < goku_:#liferay> jardineworks_, ok
09:16 < goku_:#liferay> jardineworks_, i am new to the struts action overriding this..am checking it ,,thanks for helping
09:21 < Bilou:#liferay> Hi All, I'm new in liferay world, and i need some councils to start developping in this technologie. by what i soulad start please.
09:21 < Bilou:#liferay> Hi All, I'm new in liferay world, and i need some councils to start developping in this technologie. by what i should start please.
09:24 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> hi there
09:24 < jardineworks_:#liferay> hey goku_ are you planning to save the extra details in the LR database? or soemwhere else entirely?
09:24 < jardineworks_:#liferay> hey nicolas_FR
09:25 < jardineworks_:#liferay> Bilou, start with a project idea and go from there. There are also a lot of books published now that have examples you can walk through.
09:28 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> problem with GroupFinderImpl apparently. We're migrating our portlet from 5.2.3 to 6.1.2 and one of the portlet has a configuration page which call a search method from GroupFinderImpl. If I click the "configure" link from the portlet, I have an error. Debugging the portal, I see that GroupFinderImpl has an exception thrown at L693 (adding the last query param).
09:29 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> Exception being : Positional parameter does not exist: 6 in query:
09:31 < jardineworks_:#liferay> nicolas_FR, I don't have a 6.1.2 code base handy -- but have you tried putting a break point in that method and stepping through? make sure your parameters have the values you expect, etc?
09:32 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> jardineworks_: yes I'm debugging with a break point. most params are null (but query test is param is null). Adding last one throws the error. Seems like there too much params to add or not enough "?" in the query...don't know
09:36 < jardineworks_:#liferay> nicolas_FR, If you didn't have the right number of parameters then the method wouldn't be called right? Method signature has to match in order for the call to be made -- so I doubt it is that. UNLESS... you have your binaries mixed up and you have the wrong class in your classpath being invoked or something.
09:36 < goku_:#liferay> jardineworks_, actually i need to store this data in different database..or is that possible to save in LR db?
09:36 < jardineworks_:#liferay> but if it was were the parameters then I would expect a "no such method" exception.
09:37 < jardineworks_:#liferay> goku_, if you just want to have more user attributes and you can keep them in the same database then I would recommend an Expando attribute for the user model. You can set those values (once defined) in the custom attributes section when editing a user.
09:38 < jardineworks_:#liferay> goku_, what is the attribute you are trying to record?
09:39 < goku_:#liferay> jardineworks_, i need this new attribute to be showns along side with the user name and all on the main page,,if i use expando then i will only able to show them in the custom fields link right?
09:39 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> jardineworks_: I'm debugging this class : http://grepcode.com/file/repo1.maven.org/maven2/com.liferay.portal/portal-impl/6.1.2/com/liferay/portal/service/persistence/GroupFinderImpl.java?av=f. All is ok until line 693, which trigger the exception and go to the catch L738
09:40 < jardineworks_:#liferay> goku_, yeah, I suppose it depends on whether or not you can edit it from that page as well.
09:40 < jardineworks_:#liferay> goku_, if it is just to display you could use the expando and then a JSP hook to show it.
09:41 < jardineworks_:#liferay> goku_, But if you need to change it, then you would need to use the StrutsAction hook.
09:42 < jardineworks_:#liferay> nicolas_FR, qpos.add(description) is shown twice... I wonder why.
09:43 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> jardineworks_: the query is like "if description = ? or ? is null
09:43 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> so they add x2 description
09:43 < jardineworks_:#liferay> 	public void  [More ...] add(String value) {
09:43 < jardineworks_:#liferay> 313
09:43 < jardineworks_:#liferay> 		_query.setString(_pos++, value);
09:43 < jardineworks_:#liferay> 314
09:43 < jardineworks_:#liferay> 	}
09:43 < jardineworks_:#liferay> nicolas_FR, but why?
09:44 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> well they do the same for "name" param, and they do it too in 6.2
09:44 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> doing a qPos.add(name, 2)
09:45 < jardineworks_:#liferay> nicolas_FR, can you share the full stack trace with me?
09:45 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> sure, 1min
09:45 < jardineworks_:#liferay> I think that is a hibernate error
09:47 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> http://pastebin.com/9nhudDpG
09:56 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> jardineworks_: question : in a QueryPos, first ? is pos 0 or pos 1 ?
09:57 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> Because the setJoin add a param into the query and do a pos_++, so first query parameter (companyId) is set at pos_=1
10:14 < jardineworks_:#liferay> nicolas_FR, sorry -- conference call
10:15 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> jardineworks_: np
10:19 < jardineworks_:#liferay> nicolas_FR, possibly related? https://issues.liferay.com/browse/LPS-25552?jql=project%20%3D%20LPS%20AND%20text%20~%20%22Positional%20parameter%20does%20not%20exist%22
10:24 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> jardineworks_: We might have found something.. we were setting the "type_" param instead of the "types". But can't say if that's it
10:25 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> jardineworks_: we were doing :params.put("type_", 1); We are now doing : params.put("types", typesTmp); where typesTmp is a list of Integer ( just the number 1)
10:37 < vernaillen:#liferay> jardineworks_, thanks for your reply in the forum regarding the Recources Importer
10:38 < vernaillen:#liferay> jardineworks_, I mean this thread: https://www.liferay.com/community/forums/-/message_boards/message/43256723
10:38 < jardineworks_:#liferay> vernaillen, no problem
10:38 < goku_:#liferay> jardinwworks_, hi is that possible to get the newly created user id on the hook ,which will be overriding the /users_admin/edit_user struts action ?
10:38 < jardineworks_:#liferay> you want the source with the changes I made?
10:38 < jardineworks_:#liferay> vernaillen, I also added localization for the friendly urls.
10:38 < vernaillen:#liferay> jardineworks_, that would be great if you want to share that
