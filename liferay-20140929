05:25 < Bilou:#liferay> Hi, im new in liferay world, and i need some councils to start developping in this technologie. by what i soulad start please.
08:28 < goku_:#liferay> Hi,How to add a new field in user creation page ,along with other pages and it should get added to a seperate table , is that possible to do this with hooks?
08:28 < goku_:#liferay> *along with other params
09:06 < jardineworks_:#liferay> goku_, do you mean in the user (self) registration page? or do you mean in the control panel?
09:07 < goku_:#liferay> jardineworks_, i need one extra param in user_edit.jsp and save that new param in different table
09:09 < goku_:#liferay> jardineworks_, if i edit that jsp page the new param will come in the add page in control panel right?
09:09 < jardineworks_:#liferay> goku_, ok -- so you would use a JSP hook to add that field... and then you need to create a StrutsAction (Portlet I think) hook to "augment" the save action. EditUserAction I think is the class for the strts action.
09:09 < jardineworks_:#liferay> goku_, yep.
09:10 < jardineworks_:#liferay> and then for the save, you basically copy the EditUserAction -- let it do whatever it does now, but at the end of the "save" steps, add in the ones for your own -- save it to an expando, or external database, call a service, whatever.
09:11 < jardineworks_:#liferay> goku_, I think you dropped before this came throuhg.
