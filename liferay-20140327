13:32 < juan_:#liferay> does anyone has any idea of how to modify the auth session system of liferay?
13:32 < juan_:#liferay> is there some special porlet for modifying it?
13:50 < jardineworks:#liferay> juan_, in the control panel you can set the various authentication mechanims -- including one for OpenSSO
13:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> juan_, otherwise you may need to write hooks to provide your own method
17:18 < Naenyn:#liferay> so, when adding a hook.. you can write a hook for any property that is listed in portal.properties?
17:26 < Naenyn:#liferay> any property that contains a classname, anyway
