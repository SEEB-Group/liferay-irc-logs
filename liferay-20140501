10:58 < dawn> @jhf: I have quick question about Search container orderable column headers. I see a different behaviour in CE vs EE version. In EE one can sort by either clicking in Header text or Up/Down icons, but in CE only by Header text.
10:58 < dawn> @jhf: any ideas why this different behaviour?
10:58 <@jhf> which version of Liferay?
10:59 < dawn> this is 6.2
10:59 < dawn> to be specific, 6.2.0 CE vs 6.2.10.1 EE GA1
