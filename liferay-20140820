04:55 < maleen:#liferay> hi
04:57 < ngirardin:#liferay> Hi!
04:58 < ngirardin:#liferay> First time here, seems quite calm
04:58 < ngirardin:#liferay> US guys are still sleeping
05:54 < twen:#liferay> Hello
05:54 < twen:#liferay> we are building a Liferay + alfresco system.
05:55 < twen:#liferay> Our provider is telling us that using Alfresco will limit the power of lifery in the document management, because liferay is not able to send metadata (from document type) to alfresco through CMIS
05:55 < twen:#liferay> is that real ?
05:56 < twen:#liferay> this is for us a big drawback, and we need to consider alternatives :-/
05:56 < twen:#liferay> Has anybody a view on his ? I thouht liferay
05:56 < twen:#liferay> I thought liferay + alfresco wa spretty common
07:07 < maleen:#liferay> Hii

11:34 < aqquadro:#liferay> hi there, anyone as tried to setup a customizable page, on 6.2ga2, with the user able to add an application to the customizable section of the page?
11:42 < aqquadro:#liferay> because I've tried but the user was unable to add application with the normal "add to page" permission defined in a site role
12:49 < bwood:#liferay> is there a good guide for setting up maven development environment for liferay 6.2?
12:52 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo, fyi -- that link you found yesteerday for JRebel with EXT didn't work. And it turns out that ZT support is useless.
16:19 < jardineworks:#liferay> LOL
