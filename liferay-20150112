09:02 <@jhf:#liferay> good morning/afternoon/evening everyone! I need a volunteer for a very simple task, in about 1 hour.. anyone able to offer their serviceS? :)
09:16 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, whatcha need?
09:18 <@jhf:#liferay> jardineworks: !!
09:18 <@jhf:#liferay> hey I just need you to pick a random number
09:19 <@jhf:#liferay> but not yet.. at 10am ET
09:19 <@jhf:#liferay> this is for the quarterly top contributor award from last year
09:19 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, between one and three?
09:19 < jardineworks:#liferay> :)
09:19 <@jhf:#liferay> yup :)
09:19 < jardineworks:#liferay> ok
09:19 <@jhf:#liferay> but don't do it yet!
09:19 < jardineworks:#liferay> hahaha
09:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> does your completely fool proof winner-picker only work at 10am EST?
09:23 <@jhf:#liferay> well to avoid the appearance of impropriety
09:23 <@jhf:#liferay> if you were to choose it now, I could "fix" the game so that my personal favorite would win
09:24 <@jhf:#liferay> I mean we could theoretically communicate secretely beforehand
09:24 <@jhf:#liferay> but this is as good as I can make it without a ton of effort
09:25 <@jhf:#liferay> so the way it works is. I create a string, and compute it's SHA-256 hash and tell everyone the hash
09:25 <@jhf:#liferay> the string is like "person1,person2,person3"
09:25 <@jhf:#liferay> then you pick the number of the winner
09:25 <@jhf:#liferay> then I reveal who won, and the original string, so that everyone can verify that the string was generated before the number was picked
09:26 <@jhf:#liferay> the only way I could cheat is if I tell you what number to pick, in a secret chat
09:27 < jardineworks:#liferay> has anyone ever actually called BS? :)
09:27 <@jhf:#liferay> nope, not yet :)
09:42 <@jhf:#liferay> HajiSouka: !
09:42 <@jhf:#liferay> welcome
09:42 < HajiSouka:#liferay> thank you :)
09:43 <@jhf:#liferay> <-- James Falkner
09:44 <@jhf:#liferay> Manali: !!
09:44 <@jhf:#liferay> welcome :)
09:44 <@jhf:#liferay> we have 2 of 3 contestants in today's drawing.. just waiting on the (in)famous Jack Bakker
09:47 < Manali:#liferay> Thanks James :)
09:51 <@jhf:#liferay> So Manali and HajiSouka the way this works is: I create a string with everyone's name in it (like "Joe=1,Bob=2,Alice=3"), then calculate it's SHA-256 hash and tell everyone the hash.  then my volunteer will choose a number which will indicate the winner. Then I reveal the string and the winner. This allows everyone to independently verify that the drawing was (mostly) random and fair. :)
09:51 <@jhf:#liferay> jack_bakker: !
09:52 <@jhf:#liferay> so we have everyone here so we can get started. jardineworks you ready?
09:52 < jack_bakker:#liferay> howdy, from Canada
09:52 < jardineworks:#liferay> ready -- though you are supposed to call me your lovely assistant. ahem.
09:52 < jardineworks:#liferay> :)
09:53 <@jhf:#liferay> ok I have created the string with everyone's name in it. The SHA-256 hash of this string is dfb7f56f90325f9388c4bd230eaad6fba98598d38d25e94c44c1bd0d89e6cc86
09:53 <@jhf:#liferay> jack_bakker: Manali HajiSouka are you ready?
09:53 < Manali:#liferay> yeah fingers crossed !!
09:53 < HajiSouka:#liferay> Yea
09:54 <@jhf:#liferay> ok. now, my lovely assistant (ahem) will now choose a number between 1 and 3, inclusively. lovely assistant, you may now choose. (drumroll with your mouth at the same time, please -- we'll be listening)
09:54 < jardineworks:#liferay> ONE!
09:54 <@jhf:#liferay> aaaaaaand the winner is....................................................................
09:54 < jardineworks:#liferay> hahaha
09:55 -!- mode/#liferay [+o jhf] by ChanServ
09:55 <@jhf:#liferay> just kidding
09:55 < HajiSouka:#liferay> hhhhhh
09:55 <@jhf:#liferay> the winner is... HAJI!!!!
09:55 < jack_bakker:#liferay> hah
09:55 < HajiSouka:#liferay> Yeaaaaaa
09:55 < jack_bakker:#liferay> congrats !
09:55 < jardineworks:#liferay> \o/ Haji owes me a beer!
09:55 <@jhf:#liferay> the string was "Haji=1,Jack=2,Manali=3"
09:55 < Manali:#liferay> congrats :)
09:55 <@jhf:#liferay> if you wish to verify: echo -n 'Haji=1,Jack=2,Manali=3' | openssl sha256
09:55 < jardineworks:#liferay> might have been easier to collect from Jack though.
09:55 < HajiSouka:#liferay> Im so greatfull :D
09:55 <@jhf:#liferay> what have they won?
09:56 < HajiSouka:#liferay> drinks on me :p
09:56 <@jhf:#liferay> Haji can choose: free Liferay training seat, free pass to any Liferay event worldwide, or a USD 200 gift card (converted to local currency if desired)
09:56 <@jhf:#liferay> you don't have to choose now Haji
09:56 <@jhf:#liferay> just think it over and email me your desire
09:56 < HajiSouka:#liferay> Ok thank you again james
09:57 <@jhf:#liferay> and thanks to all three of you for your excellent contributions to our community last year
09:57 <@jhf:#liferay> lovely assistant: you'll get NOTHING and like it
