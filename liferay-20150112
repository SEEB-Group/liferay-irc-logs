09:02 <@jhf:#liferay> good morning/afternoon/evening everyone! I need a volunteer for a very simple task, in about 1 hour.. anyone able to offer their serviceS? :)
09:16 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, whatcha need?
09:18 <@jhf:#liferay> jardineworks: !!
09:18 <@jhf:#liferay> hey I just need you to pick a random number
09:19 <@jhf:#liferay> but not yet.. at 10am ET
09:19 <@jhf:#liferay> this is for the quarterly top contributor award from last year
09:19 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, between one and three?
09:19 < jardineworks:#liferay> :)
09:19 <@jhf:#liferay> yup :)
09:19 < jardineworks:#liferay> ok
09:19 <@jhf:#liferay> but don't do it yet!
09:19 < jardineworks:#liferay> hahaha
09:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> does your completely fool proof winner-picker only work at 10am EST?
09:23 <@jhf:#liferay> well to avoid the appearance of impropriety
09:23 <@jhf:#liferay> if you were to choose it now, I could "fix" the game so that my personal favorite would win
09:24 <@jhf:#liferay> I mean we could theoretically communicate secretely beforehand
09:24 <@jhf:#liferay> but this is as good as I can make it without a ton of effort
09:25 <@jhf:#liferay> so the way it works is. I create a string, and compute it's SHA-256 hash and tell everyone the hash
09:25 <@jhf:#liferay> the string is like "person1,person2,person3"
09:25 <@jhf:#liferay> then you pick the number of the winner
09:25 <@jhf:#liferay> then I reveal who won, and the original string, so that everyone can verify that the string was generated before the number was picked
09:26 <@jhf:#liferay> the only way I could cheat is if I tell you what number to pick, in a secret chat
09:27 < jardineworks:#liferay> has anyone ever actually called BS? :)
09:27 <@jhf:#liferay> nope, not yet :)
09:42 <@jhf:#liferay> HajiSouka: !
09:42 <@jhf:#liferay> welcome
09:42 < HajiSouka:#liferay> thank you :)
09:43 <@jhf:#liferay> <-- James Falkner
