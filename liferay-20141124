07:10 < g33kyboi:#liferay> hello
07:12 < g33kyboi:#liferay> I tried providing a custom implementation for liferay login service. I want to inject spring managed beans into the class that extends Liferay's UserLocalServiceWrapper but the injected beans (done using autowired) are null. typically means they weren't autowired. Please is it enough to annotate the service class's custom implementation with just @Component as this is what I have done. thanks
07:22 < topolik:#liferay> g33kyboi: hi, what LR version do you use?
07:24 < g33kyboi:#liferay> liferay 6.2.0
07:29 < topolik:#liferay> ok, just to orient myself in the problem
07:30 < topolik:#liferay> you want to provide your own implementation of UserLocalService, right?
07:33 < g33kyboi:#liferay> yes
07:34 < g33kyboi:#liferay> and I have to autowire my DAO into the CustomUserLocalServiceImpl
07:34 < g33kyboi:#liferay> but the autowired DAO returns a null value
07:35 < topolik:#liferay> I see
07:35 < g33kyboi:#liferay> Is this possible?
07:36 < topolik:#liferay> if you use Hook then no
07:36 < topolik:#liferay> https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/blob/6.2.0-ga1/portal-impl/src/com/liferay/portal/deploy/hot/HookHotDeployListener.java#L2205
07:36 < topolik:#liferay> the service is created using constructor, there is no Spring context involved
07:38 < topolik:#liferay> but all the classes from your plugin should be accessible
07:38 < topolik:#liferay> there is just no Spring framework here
07:39 < g33kyboi:#liferay> "all the classes from the plugin should be accesible"? how, without creating new instances?
07:40 < topolik:#liferay> they are accessible because your UserLocalServiceAAAA class is loaded using the plugin's classloader
07:42 < topolik:#liferay> it's because we need to avoid problems with classloading and different spring contexts
07:43 < topolik:#liferay> therefore portal creates a proxy around your class and injects it into the wrapper with link to the previous implementation
07:44 < topolik:#liferay> if you want to access Spring beans from the plugin's Spring context there is a workaround using PortletBeanLocatorUtil
07:49 < g33kyboi:#liferay> whats the impact on performance? Is this a recommended approach ? as I just came across a suggestion to use @BeanReference annotation
07:56 < g33kyboi:#liferay> whats the impact on performance? Is this a recommended approach ? as I just came across a suggestion to use @BeanReference annotation
08:03 < topolik:#liferay> I don't think any Spring annotation works when the class is not instantiated using Spring framework
08:04 < g33kyboi:#liferay> The annotation above is liferay annotation
08:04 < g33kyboi:#liferay> com.liferay.portal.kernel.bean.BeanReference;
08:13 < topolik:#liferay> sorry, need to leave now, quickly looking into BeanReferenceAnnotationBeanPostProcessor it seems that only portal spring context is involved here and I guess BeanReferenceAnnotationBeanPostProcessor is only wired using Spring again
08:16 < g33kyboi:#liferay> okay. thanks!
08:16 < g33kyboi:#liferay> I will figure it out
08:20 < Uzzi:#liferay> Workplace Reservation Manager  is not compatible with 6.2ce?
