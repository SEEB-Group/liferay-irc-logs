08:21 < scribe> Hey guys.  I'm confused about the difference between: 1) having a site with site members; 2) having a user group
08:21 < scribe> It seems all user groups get a 'site' that goes along with the user group.
08:22 < dividebyzero> you can have user groups across several sites
08:22 < dividebyzero> it's a custom aggregation
08:54 < dividebyzero> I have a jsonws service annotated to be of method POST
08:54 < dividebyzero> yet it responds to GETs
08:55 < dividebyzero> I suppose this is not the expected behaviour...?
09:00 < dividebyzero> does that only work with strict http method?
09:20 < dividebyzero> ok, that was it.
09:57 < josuebc> Hi there. I want to write a Servlet to respond to ajax calls made by a web content portlet. Should I extend the HTTPServlet class or it's safer to extend one of LifeRays wrappers? Like PortletDelegateServlet.java?
10:01 < bfarache> hey
10:01 < bfarache> you can implement the serveResource method in your portlet
10:02 < josuebc> bfarache: Well the thing is that I would like to do all my calls from the WebContent and not necessary need to add the portlet if I only need a little information from it.
10:04 < bfarache> who will be handling the request? a new plugin?
10:05 < josuebc> Well, the servlet, isnt it?
10:06 < bfarache> yeah, could be a servlet in a plugin
10:06 < bfarache> can be a HTTPServlet implementation
10:07 < josuebc> bfarache: Oh right. Yeah, I would prefer to just be the servlet. And I do started with the idea to extend HTTPServlet, but then I saw this wrappers for that class and wa wondering if it's better to use them.
10:08 < bfarache> I guess they would be helpful in some cases, but if it's just to handle an ajax request, could be a plain servlet
10:08 < bfarache> I would do it differently though
10:08 < bfarache> I would create a new service with service builder
10:08 < bfarache> and expose it remotely
10:08 < bfarache> but maybe that's too much :)
10:09 < josuebc> Actually that was my first thought. It looks it could be faster like that, but the consensus was not to use that because apparently they are afraid it may brake on future LR releases.
10:10 < josuebc> So, now I have to go with the servlet solution. I do agree with you, it would be better with a remote service.
10:10 < bfarache> I see, yeah, this servlet could go in a plugin, this way you are not messing with the portal's webapp
10:11 < bfarache> it's pretty safe to use service builder though
10:11 < bfarache> if there's a new version, you usually need to re-generate your services, and that's it
10:11 < josuebc> Because now using the servlet then we have to take care of the security, right? We would need to share the session and all that. Or how can we make sure the servlet is responding only to the correct usres?
10:11 < bfarache> ahh
10:12 < bfarache> yeah, then, it's much better to use service builder, because it handles authentication for you
10:12 < josuebc> bfarache: Yeah, that's what I thought. But I think there was already an issue some years ago and people don't want to go through that. Might be only bad codign :s
10:12 < josuebc> bfarache: Is there any way to do that on an extension of HTTPServlet?
10:12 < bfarache> with a servlet, you would have to make sure it passes through all security servlets
10:13 < bfarache> filters...
10:15 < bfarache> take an existing servlet and start from there
10:15 < josuebc> bfarache: Oh, that's gponna be a hassle, right?
10:15 < bfarache> the WebDAVServlet.java may be a good one
10:15 < josuebc> bfarache: Cool, thanks!
10:17 < bfarache> if you want to call local services, you will need to set the permission checker correctly
10:20 < dividebyzero> bfarache: how do I do to collect a post body in the *Impl class?
10:21 < bfarache> a post request?
10:21 < dividebyzero> yes
10:21 < bfarache> which *Impl? you mean a remote service impl?
10:22 < dividebyzero> yes, service builder, expose a service as POST, then call it up to send data in the body
10:22 < dividebyzero> I don't know if it is even possible
10:23 < dividebyzero> documentation refers to file upload
10:23 < bfarache> ahh
10:23 < bfarache> you want to send binary
10:23 < bfarache> you know how to send regular params right?
10:24 < dividebyzero> params, yes
10:24 < bfarache> if the service method accepts a InputStream
10:24 < bfarache> you should be able to send the binary
10:24 < bfarache> as a regular param
10:24 < bfarache> I will show an example, with document library
10:24 < bfarache> just a sec
10:24 < dividebyzero> perfect
10:24 < dividebyzero> thanks
10:26 < bfarache> https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/blob/master/portal-impl/src/com/liferay/portlet/documentlibrary/service/impl/DLAppServiceImpl.java
10:26 < bfarache> if you look at addFileEntry methods
10:26 < bfarache> you will see they either accepts bytes[], File and InputStream
10:27 < bfarache> you can just send the binary from you client
10:27 < dividebyzero> hmmm i see
10:28 < dividebyzero> lets give it a try
10:28 < bfarache> is it a javascript client?
10:28 < dividebyzero> it's a java client
10:28 < bfarache> ah, better
10:29 < dividebyzero> jump posting file content
10:29 < bfarache> yeah, I don't think it's possible to send binary with javascript, you would need to convert with base64
10:29 < bfarache> with java, it's easy by using HttpClient
10:29 < dividebyzero> i am actually using Jersey
10:31 < bfarache> with apache http client I just do:
10:32 < bfarache> HttpPost post = new HttpPost(_URL);
10:32 < bfarache> 			File file = new File(_filePath);
10:32 < bfarache> 			MultipartEntity entity = new MultipartEntity(
10:32 < bfarache> 				HttpMultipartMode.BROWSER_COMPATIBLE);
10:32 < bfarache> 			entity.addPart("file", new FileBody(file));
10:32 < bfarache> where "file" is the File parameter in the service
10:32 < dividebyzero> hmm must it use the multipart? i'm actually sending file content (text), not the file itself
10:32 < dividebyzero> not that it is much different:D
10:33 < bfarache> hm, then you don't need to send the binary, haha, why don't you just send a string?
10:33 < bfarache> too big?
10:33 < dividebyzero> i want to send as body and not as parameter
10:33 < dividebyzero> yes, too big as well :D
10:34 < dividebyzero> big xml from query
10:34 < bfarache> yeah, then send as multipart
10:34 < bfarache> your service method should have a File parameter
10:34 < dividebyzero> even if a true file never exists?
10:36 < bfarache> hm, it should work with bytes[] and InputStream too
10:36 < dividebyzero> trying with InputStream too
10:36 < dividebyzero> more elegant
10:38 < dividebyzero> trying with inputstream *first*
10:43 < dividebyzero> i am probably doing the wrong invocation
10:43 < dividebyzero> now my method signature has "name(InputStream is)"
10:43 < dividebyzero> in what way does the calling url change?
10:44 < dividebyzero> to /method/is/<stuff> ?
10:44 < bfarache> it's a POST, right? so you can't pass through the URL
10:45 < dividebyzero> now you got me
10:45 < bfarache> it needs to go in the body
10:47 < dividebyzero> yes that is right
10:47 < dividebyzero> but the method signature has changed
10:47 < bfarache> I usually use the "JSON Web Services Invoker"
10:47 < dividebyzero> and now the url no longer works
10:47 < bfarache> http://www.liferay.com/documentation/liferay-portal/6.1/development/-/ai/json-web-services
10:47 < bfarache> http://[address]:[port]/your-portlet-context/api/jsonws/invoke
10:48 < dividebyzero> the url is fine. or it was fine
10:48 < dividebyzero> not I added the InputStream
10:48 < dividebyzero> i think it believes it is a URL parameter
10:48 < dividebyzero> and not a body thing
10:48 < dividebyzero> *now I added
10:49 < bfarache> with the JSON invoker, you do:
10:51 < bfarache> {
10:51 < bfarache>     "/portlet-context/service-name/method-name": {
10:51 < bfarache>        "param1": 123,
10:51 < bfarache>        "param2": null
10:51 < bfarache>     }
10:51 < bfarache> }
10:51 < bfarache> ahh, I don't use the invoker to send binary
10:51 < bfarache> I just send it as part of the request body
10:51 < bfarache> I use the regular /jsonws/ URL
10:52 < dividebyzero> not desirable in this case
10:52 < dividebyzero> public String testpost2(InputStream is) {
10:52 < dividebyzero> i think the url might be http://[address]:[port]/your-portlet-context/api/jsonws/class/is/<thestream>
10:53 < dividebyzero> so it's not working
10:53 < bfarache> correct, but no <thestream>
10:53 < bfarache> it can't be part of the URL
10:53 < dividebyzero> ok, let me change then for just /is
10:53 < dividebyzero> {"exception":"Missing value for parameter is"}
10:54 < bfarache> "is" is the method name?
10:54 < bfarache> or the param name?
10:54 < dividebyzero> public String testpost2(InputStream is) {
10:55 < bfarache> http://[address]:[port]/your-portlet-context/api/jsonws/class/testpost2
10:55 < dividebyzero> that way it wont work
10:55 < dividebyzero> it is expecting the 'is'
10:55 < bfarache> and the request data should have a "is" param
10:55 < bfarache> are you sending as a POST or is still GET?
10:55 < dividebyzero> post
10:56 < dividebyzero> {"exception":"No JSON web service action associated with path /myclass/testpost2 and method POST for //My-portlet"}
10:56 < dividebyzero> when i dont call using the 'is'
10:56 < bfarache> how are you passing the body data?
10:56 < dividebyzero> webResource.post(ClientResponse.class, payload);
10:57 < dividebyzero> my body data is "payload"
10:57 < bfarache> what's payload? a string?
10:57 < dividebyzero> webResource is of type WebResource.Builder (jersey class)
10:57 < dividebyzero> a string, yes
10:58 < bfarache> are you using multipart?
10:59 < bfarache> section "Sending files as arguments" in the docs:
10:59 < dividebyzero> no, right now i am sending a basic "hello" still
10:59 < bfarache> <form action="http://localhost:8080/api/secure/jsonws/dlapp/add-file-entry" method="POST" enctype="multipart/form-data">
10:59 < bfarache>         <input type="hidden" name="repositoryId" value="10172"/>
10:59 < bfarache>         <input type="hidden" name="folderId" value="0"/>
10:59 < bfarache>         <input type="hidden" name="title" value="test.jpg"/>
10:59 < bfarache>         <input type="hidden" name="description" value="File upload example"/>
10:59 < bfarache>         <input type="hidden" name="changeLog" value="v1"/>
10:59 < bfarache>         <input type="file" name="file"/>
10:59 < bfarache>         <input type="submit" value="addFileEntry(file)"/>
10:59 < bfarache> </form>
10:59 < dividebyzero> my client does not start in that way, it queries an external DB (which returns a string), and then i want to inject that same string (which is an xml file content) to the service
11:00 < dividebyzero> so it's like sending a string. just large, and in the body
11:00 < bfarache> if you are sending the parameter as a string, Liferay will look for methods called testpost2 that accepts strings
11:01 < dividebyzero> only i don't want it sent as parameter
11:01 < dividebyzero> calls with parameters are working fine
11:01 < bfarache> https://jersey.java.net/documentation/latest/media.html#d0e6016
11:02 < dividebyzero> good find :$
11:03 < dividebyzero> still concerned on the serer-side issue
11:03 < dividebyzero> but one thing at a tim
11:04 < bfarache> I'm confident that your remote services can accept binaries, I use it every day, haha
11:04 < bfarache> I think it's just a matter on finding out how to use your client
11:04 < dividebyzero> high hopes :D
11:05 < bfarache> try with a <form> in a html page, as the form example I pasted
11:05 < bfarache> it should work
11:09 < dividebyzero> hit an authentication roadblock, 1 more sec
11:10 < dividebyzero> "exception":"No JSON web service action associated with ....
11:11 < dividebyzero> ah might need to change server from inputstream to multipart
11:16 < dividebyzero> doesnt want to recognize jersey, taking a bit longer
11:19 < bfarache> need to leave, ttyl
11:20 < dividebyzero> ok, thanks very much
11:21 < dividebyzero> have a good weekend!
12:29 < josuebc> Hi, I created a hello world servlet extending httservlet and modified web.xml accordingly. The problem is that if I go to the URL it says Servlet [servlet name] is not available. How come liferay can't find it? where should I put it?
12:36 < bfarache> where's the servlet located?
12:38 < bfarache> josuebc: it should be located under WEB-INF/lib or WEB-INF/classes
12:43 < josuebc> bfarache: Yes, is under WEB-INF/classes/org/servlets/ and on top of the servlet i have "package org.servlets". I just noticed that the error message gets thrown by 404_jsp.
12:43 < josuebc> Is it trying to locate a JSP with that?
12:44 < bfarache> what's the stack trace?
12:45 < josuebc> None, just that message [404_jsp]: Servlet Ajax Test is not available
12:45 < bfarache> hm, not sure
12:45 < bfarache> try another package name?
12:46 < bfarache> com.mypackage
12:47 < josuebc> I don't have to restart the server, right.
12:47 < bfarache> you have to
12:51 < josuebc> bfarache: It is bassically a java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: org.servlets.AjaxTest
12:52 < bfarache> strange, you have to restart the portal
12:52 < bfarache> every time you add a servlet
12:52 < josuebc> bfarache: Yes, Done it a couple of times already.
12:53 < josuebc> I added it inside tomcat/webapps/ROOT/WEB-INF/web.xml
12:53 < bfarache> who's the servlet definition in web.xml?
12:53 < bfarache> how
12:53 < bfarache> can you paste it?
12:54 < josuebc> All or just the one I added?
12:55 < bfarache> what you added

13:07 < josuebc:#liferay> bfarache: Yeah, that's what I was thinking :s I'll try different things. Thanks!
13:07 < bfarache:#liferay> if you copy webdavservlet
13:07 < bfarache:#liferay> and put them together
13:07 < bfarache:#liferay> and copy the same web.xml configs, except for the mapping
13:08 < bfarache:#liferay> it's a good start, hehe, do something very similar to the existing liferay servlets
13:08 < bfarache:#liferay> and modify them form there
13:08 < bfarache:#liferay> from there
13:09 < josuebc:#liferay> Yeap, that was my next try
13:09 < bfarache:#liferay> the webdavservlet is inside portal-impl.jar
13:20 < josuebc:#liferay> Thank you!
13:23 < goldmantx:#liferay> Is there a way to combine local and global documents in the Documents and Media Display? I think the answer is no unless you modify it as it seems scoped to global or local but no ability to do both….
13:26 < bfarache:#liferay> when you set the scope of the portlet to global, the local docs don't sow up?
13:26 < bfarache:#liferay> show
13:27 < bfarache:#liferay> perhaps with asset publisher you show both?
13:51 < goldmantx:#liferay> I could try that, not sure…I thought in my testing before, it only adhered to the scope set in the configuarion of the portlet
14:00 < josuebc:#liferay> bfarache: Alright, So i think I am trying the same thing on another liferay installation. But Now I am getting this error when starting up the server: java.lang.ClassFormatError: Incompatible magic value 1885430635 Any ideas?
