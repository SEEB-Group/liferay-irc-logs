01:18 < Axxell:#liferay> greetings again fellow humans, question: Power users see some edit controls on the main site (mainly refresh portlet tool on som portlets), how can i disable those for power user, unless he is on his personal page
03:50 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> i, a newb to liferay. I need to show a list of items, which can be checked. how shall i show this?
03:51 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> * meant "I'm a newb"
04:00 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> You mean checkboxes?
04:01 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> And what's supposed to happen when the user submits the form that contains these checkboxes?
04:09 < sirhirzu:#liferay> anyone here who has solved how to export/import very big portals on LR 6.1 ?
04:11 < sirhirzu:#liferay> when trying to export huge portal the server just hangs for me. Nothing in logs and the "your request failed to complete." message on admin app. Anyone with any ideas?
06:14 < Axxell:#liferay> i also have trouble with the sprite default dir
06:18 < Axxell:#liferay> um hum
06:18 < Axxell:#liferay> whats wrong with this today, my messages are not gettign trough
06:19 < Axxell:#liferay> i have trouble with sprite generation and imagemagick on liferay 6.1.2, could it be a windows path problem, what is the standard way too describe paths in ext-portal.properties
06:19 < Axxell:#liferay> in some guids ites like "c:\\mypath\\mypath"
06:19 < Axxell:#liferay> some have
06:19 < Axxell:#liferay> c:/mypath/mypath
06:19 < Axxell:#liferay> and some even have the standard c:\mypath\mypath
06:40 < Axxell:#liferay> long story short: i can get soffice to work, but imagemagick doesnt wanna
06:55 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Does anybody know if there is a tutorial on how build many-to-many relationships with ServiceBuilder, which actually works?
06:56 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> So far I found loads and loads of stuff about that topic, but nothing that actually helped to get it done... :-/
07:19 < Axxell:#liferay> hmm intresting, webdav in liferay 6.1.2 GA3 does not seem to work, it gives "file to large for destination file system" even if the file is as small as possible. and liferay sync doesnt display all sites available
07:34 < Axxell:#liferay> okey found the liferay sync site, problem was that it was as a companyid not a name, must be a bug in liferay sync
07:35 < Axxell:#liferay> anybody know about any problems and solutions using webdav on windows?
07:40 < modd:#liferay> Axxell: there's a registry entry to fix this
07:41 < Axxell:#liferay> modd: ok? it doesnt seem to be able to take any size at alla, but any clue where i can find info on it?
07:42 < modd:#liferay> moment
07:43 < modd:#liferay> check HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\WebClient\Parameters
07:43 < modd:#liferay> edit FileSizeLimitInBytes and change its value to 4294967295
07:43 < modd:#liferay> then reboot
07:46 < Axxell:#liferay> thanks a lot will test
08:01 < Axxell:#liferay> modd: nope didnt help
08:01 < Axxell:#liferay> modd: still get an error
08:01 < modd:#liferay> hmm
08:02 < Axxell:#liferay> "the file 'xxxx' is too large for the destination file system
08:02 < Axxell:#liferay> "
08:02 < modd:#liferay> the whole webdav implementation is some kind of useless. seems like you can't use xp and win7 at the same time because microsoft did some changes to the system and lr can't activate both
08:03 < Axxell:#liferay> hmm
08:03 < Axxell:#liferay> they could have differrent webdav urls to different implementations
08:03 < modd:#liferay> do you have a file size limit in your liferay installation?
08:03 < Axxell:#liferay> modd: yeah i do, but its large
08:04 < Axxell:#liferay> i can put 100mb files with liferay sync
08:04 < Axxell:#liferay> so no problem there
08:04 < Axxell:#liferay> its just webdac that refuses to work
08:04 < modd:#liferay> last time I used lf sync it had some problems with permissions
08:05 < modd:#liferay> check your app server and lr logs for webdav errors
08:05 < Axxell:#liferay> might be buying the EE version, but i really got to have a funktioning way to work with a lot of fiiles
08:05 < modd:#liferay> EE doesn't work better on this point
08:06 < Axxell:#liferay> well liferay sync in EE allowes multiple sites, but if webdav would work, there wouldnt be any issues
08:10 < Axxell:#liferay> well another restart

09:03 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I have to ask again: Does anyone have a proper tutorial about how to make many-to-many relationships work with ServiceBuilder? There is so much different information about that out there...I feel lost.
09:56 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Nobody? I can't be the only one who wants to do something "fancy" like having a many-to-many relationship..
09:58 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> It's basically just products and categories.
09:59 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Every product can have any number of categories and then of course vice versa.
17:11 < Jayj:#liferay> Good day liferay group, may I ask about this jsonws service has a popup authentication upon accessing it?
17:11 < Jayj:#liferay> im using Liferay 6.1.1 CE GA2
17:12 < Jayj:#liferay> i tried to put this [json.service.auth.token.enabled=false] on my portal-ext.properties
17:12 < Jayj:#liferay> but still its showing the pop up authentication
