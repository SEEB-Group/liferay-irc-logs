05:04 < hufg:#liferay> topolik: whats the meaning of system property in liferay-portlet.xml?
05:04 < hufg:#liferay> i read it as "core portlet, don't touch this"
05:10 < hufg:#liferay> anyways portlet 19 message boards isn't marked as such but internally it is used for comments on various portlets and they break if you remove it
05:30 < hufg:#liferay> Set the system value to true if the portlet is a system portlet that a user cannot manually add to their page. The default value is false.
05:30 < hufg:#liferay> ah ok my bad
05:33 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Morning.
05:36 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Mhm. Interesting. I just found this answer from Olaf Kock on Stackoverflow: http://stackoverflow.com/a/17742577/989169
05:36 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> He's suggesting exactly the same thing I've been thinking about since I started to find a solution for our search problems...
05:56 < hufg:#liferay> uhuh have you tried web content search btw?
05:57 < hufg:#liferay> search is a bit more advanced and gives links to web articles directly
05:57 < hufg:#liferay> although it still just searches for web content but the links are pointing to pages 8)
05:57 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Mhm? What do you mean?
05:58 < hufg:#liferay> there are two searches
05:58 < hufg:#liferay> portlet id 77 and 3
06:06 < hufg:#liferay> 77 searches the webcontent and outputs a link
06:06 < hufg:#liferay> to the page where it is contained
06:06 < hufg:#liferay> if the web content is on multiple page all pages will be outputted
06:06 < hufg:#liferay> if this is sufficient for you idk
06:07 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Uh.
06:07 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Are you kidding me? How did I never see that before?
06:08 < hufg:#liferay> 8)
06:09 < hufg:#liferay> i bet you could combine something ridiculous to exclude certain articles
06:09 < hufg:#liferay> if you have an article on 120 pages
06:10 < hufg:#liferay> no pdf search though
06:11 < hufg:#liferay> and btw you can invoke the portlet without needing
06:11 < hufg:#liferay> to actually have the portlet on page
06:12 < hufg:#liferay> PortletUrlFactory
06:16 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Does Liferay have some kind of audio player for uploaded audio files?
06:16 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> The asset publisher doesn't show one.
06:17 < hufg:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur: is the web content search good enough?
06:17 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I'll check right now.
06:17 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> (I'm always swarmed with lots of different questions at once.)
06:18 < hufg:#liferay> the perils of multitasking
06:18 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Yeah. And other people controlling my priorities.
06:19 < hufg:#liferay> yes thats very bad
06:19 < hufg:#liferay> =(
06:19 < hufg:#liferay> i have it so good right now i can't believe it
06:20 < hufg:#liferay> i can basically manage my self along the project priorities
06:20 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Well...I'm in a good spot actually. I'm just a few months out of my junior role and already responsible for the entire architecture of our project.
06:20 < modd_:#liferay> hi jhf. the slides are still not up at http://www.liferay.com/web/devcon2013 :(
06:20 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> People actually listen to me. That's a nice change.
06:20 < hufg:#liferay> hehe neat
06:25 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Mmhm.
06:25 < hufg:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur: how long have you worked with liferay?
06:25 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> The web content search looks nice, but I'm not exactly sure it's what we need.
06:26 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> And the customization options are pretty much not in existence.
06:26 < hufg:#liferay> you need to hook it
06:27 < hufg:#liferay> and leave it BLEEDING AND DYING
06:27 < hufg:#liferay> !!!
06:27 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> ;)
06:27 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I've been working with Liferay for 3 months now.
06:28 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Several years of Liferay experience, a few years of ColdFusion and ages PHP and other webstuff.
06:28 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Uh Sorry. Several years of Java experience.
06:28 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Not Liferay.
06:31 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Mhm. I guess I will have to fiddle around with the portlet a little bit.
06:32 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> It shows the page URL, but not the page title.
06:32 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> And it looks like it finds more stuff than we would like it to find.

11:14 < sgeef:#liferay> Hi there, I was wondering if someone here has experience with Kaleo?
11:15 < sgeef:#liferay> I'm making a custom implementation of kaleo for one of my custom views.. but i would like to provide in the xml if the transition is visible for an user or no? because one of my transitions is made by code..
11:15 < sgeef:#liferay> Any ideas on how to do this? without hard coding it?
11:46 < sgeef:#liferay> Anyone on my earlier quesiton?
11:46 < sgeef:#liferay> i repeat: I'm making a custom implementation of kaleo for one of my custom views.. but i would like to provide in the xml if the transition is visible for an user or no? because one of my transitions is made by code..
11:46 < sgeef:#liferay> :)
17:14 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey jhf are you around for a velocity question?
17:15 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah for a few more mins.
17:15 <@jhf:#liferay> whats up?
17:16 < jardineworks:#liferay> cool
17:16 < jardineworks:#liferay> i have a tpl
17:16 < jardineworks:#liferay> homepage.tpl lets call it
17:16 < jardineworks:#liferay> it's all fancy pants with responsiveness and div based layouts.
17:17 < jardineworks:#liferay> I have 4 cols ear marked with divs.
17:17 < jardineworks:#liferay> problem is that when there is no content in a div, nothing really renders to indicate that it is there
17:18 <@jhf:#liferay> ok.. but the tags are delivered in the html sent to the client right? i.e. <div></div> ?
17:18 < jardineworks:#liferay> is there a way (that you know of) to write a conditional expression for the $processor such that if it's output is ... what blank? (meaning no portlets in that column) I can output some html to make the div obvious?
17:18 < jardineworks:#liferay> $processor.processColumn just produces html right?
17:18 < jardineworks:#liferay> so it's output is just a big string?
17:19 <@jhf:#liferay> I believe so. so you can test it with $validator.isNull()
17:19 < jardineworks:#liferay> and if there are no portlets... does it produce "" or null?
17:19 <@jhf:#liferay> (which returns true for blank strings, null pointers, etc)
17:19 < jardineworks:#liferay> ah
17:19 <@jhf:#liferay> checking..
17:19 < jardineworks:#liferay> can I put jstl in a tpl?
17:19 < jardineworks:#liferay> or scriplets?
17:20 <@jhf:#liferay> I don't think so. they aren't processed as JSPs that I know of
17:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> right -- not funneled to the engine. So then how do you do a conditional?
17:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> oh
17:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> with a velocity if?
17:21 <@jhf:#liferay> how about #set ($content = $processor.processWhatever())
17:21 <@jhf:#liferay> then
17:21 <@jhf:#liferay> #if ($validator.isNull($content))
17:21 <@jhf:#liferay>   I AM BLANK
17:21 <@jhf:#liferay> #else
17:21 <@jhf:#liferay>  $content
17:21 <@jhf:#liferay> #end
17:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> lemme try that. that looks like exactly what I was looking for
17:22 < jardineworks:#liferay> -- the I AM BLANK :)
17:22 <@jhf:#liferay> that would result in <div>I AM BLANK</div> as the output
17:22 <@jhf:#liferay> if its blank! :)
17:23 < jardineworks:#liferay> lol -- right... buit I would at least want to #language("i-am-blank") :)
17:23 <@jhf:#liferay> heh
17:24 <@jhf:#liferay> liferay-must-have-a-record-for-some-of-the-longest-i18n-keys-in-the-known-universe
17:24 < jardineworks:#liferay> didn't work
17:24 < jardineworks:#liferay> and I bet
17:24 < jardineworks:#liferay> that the portlet template with no body content comes back
17:24 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah, bet yer right.
17:24 <@jhf:#liferay> hmm
17:25 <@jhf:#liferay> there is also a $processor.getPortletsMap() which you may be able to inspect to figure out if there are portlets in the column before rendering.
17:26 < jardineworks:#liferay> what class is $processor linked to?
17:26 <@jhf:#liferay> http://docs.liferay.com/portal/6.1/javadocs-all/com/liferay/portlet/layoutconfiguration/util/velocity/TemplateProcessor.html#getPortletsMap()
17:27 < jardineworks:#liferay> so... if there were no portlets in a column, it should have a map with 0 size.
17:28 <@jhf:#liferay> well I'm not sure what that map contains
17:28 <@jhf:#liferay> you don't pass it any parameters (like column-id) so it must give you ALL portlets on the page, or something
17:28 < jardineworks:#liferay> hmmm
17:29 < jardineworks:#liferay> i wonder if the column is the key
17:30 < jardineworks:#liferay> i got a result of 5 ... which would map to the portlets I have on the page already.
