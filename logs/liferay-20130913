03:34 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> anyone there?
03:35 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> i'm having a service like this http://pastie.org/private/cdkrsg9watxduk51shnk2g the group will have multiple contacts
03:37 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> after building the service i can use the group persistence in GroupLocalServiceImpl to get the contacts associated with the group. But i'm at a loss on how to associate some contacts with a group
05:21 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Good morning.
05:22 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I have a general question about using Liferay.
05:22 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> We have a lot of content and managing it via Liferay works ok.
05:23 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Some of the pages on our website contain complex logic, usually expressed in JavaScript, because the page contains some fancy UI stuff, a small game or something like this.
05:23 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> How would you go about putting that on a Liferay page?
05:24 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Usually that stuff is developed standalone and has a certain project folder sructure.
05:24 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> *structure
05:24 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Many JS files etc.
05:25 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> When putting it in web content, we'd have to deal with somehow getting the assets on the server and linking them in the web content.
05:26 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> When putting it in a portlet...how can I get the assets into the existing asset infrastructure, i.e. CDN?
05:26 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> So confusing. Oo
05:51 < bijoo_alias:#liferay> avinashrbhat: https://github.com/liferay/liferay-plugins/blob/master/portlets/knowledge-base-portlet/docroot/WEB-INF/service.xml
05:52 < bijoo_alias:#liferay> avinashrbhat: https://github.com/liferay/liferay-plugins/blob/master/portlets/marketplace-portlet/docroot/WEB-INF/service.xml
05:52 < bijoo_alias:#liferay> avinashrbhat: ignore the first, but the second shows how.
05:53 < bijoo_alias:#liferay> avinashrbhat: "... But i'm at a loss on how to associate some contacts with a group"  -- see how App and Module entities are associated. This shows one-to-one-mapping; if you need many-to-many mapping, then create a cross-reference entity.
05:56 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> bijoo_alias, so they are using the finder to get the id only, right? as you see in my service.xml i use 'mapping-key ' on a column.
05:58 < bijoo_alias:#liferay> avinashrbhat: ok, just to check, have you looked at : https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/blob/master/definitions/liferay-service-builder_6_1_0.dtd#L156
06:00 < bijoo_alias:#liferay> avinashrbhat: looks like you want, mapping-table, no?
06:00 < bijoo_alias:#liferay> https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/blob/master/definitions/liferay-service-builder_6_1_0.dtd#L183
06:01 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> bijoo_alias, so sorry for the confusion, i wanted to use one-to-many as it's shown in the service.xml
06:02 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> bijoo_alias: and i have gone through the dtd before. and that one made me to do it
06:03 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> bijoo_alias: the problem i'm facing i that i'm able to get the mapped contacts of a group but there is no method for adding a contact in the group persistence
06:07 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Wow. Did they really remove the possibility to have your own plugin repository in the latest Liferay version?
06:08 < bijoo_alias:#liferay> avinashrbhat: another example XML to look at is: https://github.com/liferay/liferay-ide/blob/master/tools/plugins/com.liferay.ide.service.ui/sample/kaleo-service.xml
06:08 < bijoo_alias:#liferay> The relationship between KaleoNode and KaleoDefinition
06:09 < bijoo_alias:#liferay> https://github.com/liferay/liferay-ide/blob/master/tools/plugins/com.liferay.ide.service.ui/sample/kaleo-service.xml#L126
06:10 < bijoo_alias:#liferay> avinashrbhat: as far as adding it, what's the issue? Why not create a method to do it?
06:11 < bijoo_alias:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur:"...how can I get the assets into the existing asset infrastructure, i.e. CDN?" -- is this CDN-specific question?
06:12 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> bijoo_alias: Not really. The question is rather centered around the fact that we currently have a CDN (or rather a S3 bucket) to store all our assets in.
06:13 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> bijoo_alias: i'm able to get it using the Persistence instance in the LocalServiceImpl of the group, but the same doesn't have any add method, anyway the one you game me last looks good to start pondering
06:13 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> When I have a portlet that requires some new assets, like JS files or images...how would I get them into the S3?
06:13 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Because having the assets delivered by the Liferay server is not what we want.
06:14 < bijoo_alias:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur: so something like S3 REST API? http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTObjectPUT.html
06:15 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> So I would have to build some deployment listener or something, so that the portlet would store it's own stuff on the S3.
06:15 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> *its
06:16 < bijoo_alias:#liferay> Also, the DL supports S3, too.
06:16 < bijoo_alias:#liferay> https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/blob/master/portal-impl/src/com/liferay/portlet/documentlibrary/store/S3Store.java
06:17 < bijoo_alias:#liferay> Not sure if that's an option for you tough; at least, it can be guide to make this work.
06:17 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Yeah. I guess I would try to do that via the DL, if I have to.
06:17 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Would that be the preferred way to manage a complex page?
06:18 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Build a custom portlet?
06:18 < bijoo_alias:#liferay> "Some of the pages on our website contain complex logic, usually expressed in JavaScript, because the page contains some fancy UI stuff, a small game or something like this."
06:18 < bijoo_alias:#liferay> Ok; if UI stuff, why not in theme?
06:19 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Because it belongs to a single page, not the theme.
06:19 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> It's nothing global.
06:19 < bijoo_alias:#liferay> Got it, so no reuse across pages?
06:19 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Cluttering the theme with all these special JS files seems wrong to me.
06:19 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Because at some point these pages are removed again.
06:20 < bijoo_alias:#liferay> In that case, yes, a separate portlet.
06:20 < bijoo_alias:#liferay> So only loaded when portlet's on page.
06:20 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Yeah. I thought so.
06:21 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> The other option would have been to use a web content and upload the JS files via the DL.
06:21 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> But somehow I don't like spreading it like this.
06:21 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> In a portlet everything would be in one package and can be installed or removed in one action.
06:22 < bijoo_alias:#liferay> You could make a mega portlet as well; and configure it for each page as well.
06:22 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I only have to figure out a way to leverage our S3 infrastructure from within a portlet when there are different assets.
06:22 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Mhm. Complex stuff...
06:25 < bijoo_alias:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur: drop a line when you decide on something. I'll check the logs to see which way you went. Maybe interesting; thank you and ciao.
06:27 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Will do. Thanks for your ideas. :)

08:34 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> hi, should I be including the services.properties in the version control for a portlet?
08:59 -!- mode/#liferay [+o jhf] by ChanServ
11:44 < jayj:#liferay> Good day liferay group, may I ask about this jsonws service has a additional popup authentication upon accessing it? how can i bypass this?
11:44 < jayj:#liferay>  tried to put this [json.service.auth.token.enabled=false] on my portal-ext.properties
11:44 <@jhf:#liferay> hey jayj saw your forum post too..
11:44 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah there are a couple more things to do.
11:44 <@jhf:#liferay> lemme dig up an old email.
11:44 < jayj:#liferay> thansk James
11:45 < jayj:#liferay> sorry about that - I tried to look onto Ray's suggestion but we dont want to pass in credentials in the every request
11:45 <@jhf:#liferay> so you also need to declare which methods you want "public" via jsonws.web.service.public.methods so you could do (for example) jsonws.web.service.public.methods=*
11:46 <@jhf:#liferay> or get*
11:46 <@jhf:#liferay> or a specific service name
11:47 < jayj:#liferay> i already have this on my portal-ext.properties
11:47 < jayj:#liferay> json.service.auth.token.enabled=false jsonws.web.service.public.methods=* json.servlet.hosts.allowed=localhost,127.0.0.1 jsonws.web.service.invalid.http.methods=DELETE,POST,PUT
11:47 < jayj:#liferay> ooppss sorry
11:47 < jayj:#liferay> json.service.auth.token.enabled=false
11:47 < jayj:#liferay> jsonws.web.service.public.methods=*
11:47 < jayj:#liferay> json.servlet.hosts.allowed=localhost,127.0.0.1
11:47 < jayj:#liferay> jsonws.web.service.invalid.http.methods=DELETE,POST,PUT
11:47 < jayj:#liferay> that's i've tried so far
11:48 <@jhf:#liferay> can you show me an example of a URL that pops up an auth dialog?
11:48 <@jhf:#liferay> (feel free to anonymize your hostname if needed)
11:50 < jayj:#liferay> hi James sorry for taking so long I do have a screnshot
11:50 < jayj:#liferay> or the link from the forum site which exactly describes it
11:51 < jayj:#liferay> can i paste it here?
11:52 < jayj:#liferay> i mean the link from the liferay forum site
11:52 < jayj:#liferay> im not sure how to PM(private message here yet)
12:01 <@jhf:#liferay> what version of LR are you using j?
12:01 <@jhf:#liferay> doh
12:01 <@jhf:#liferay> saw the PM :)
12:01 <@jhf:#liferay> does this URL prompt: http://localhost:8080/api/jsonws/country/get-countries
12:01 <@jhf:#liferay> because on my GA3 it does not
12:02 <@jhf:#liferay> and I'm not logged in
12:02 <@jhf:#liferay> oh no wait
12:02 <@jhf:#liferay> take that back. it does prompt.
12:02 < jayj:#liferay> thanks
12:02 <@jhf:#liferay> hold on, trying some more stuffs. I always have to do this, can never remember the magic
12:03 < jayj:#liferay> thanks again
12:03 < jayj:#liferay> @Tar is your Service BUilder working now?
12:03 <@jhf:#liferay> ok no it is working right
12:03 <@jhf:#liferay> I had a plugin that was interfering
12:04 <@jhf:#liferay> but uninstalling it, and now it does not prompt
12:04 <@jhf:#liferay> I can curl -v 'http://localhost:8080/api/jsonws/country/get-countries'
12:04 <@jhf:#liferay> with no auth failures
12:04 <@jhf:#liferay> here's my portal-ext settings:
12:04 <@jhf:#liferay> json.service.auth.token.enabled=false
12:04 <@jhf:#liferay> jsonws.web.service.public.methods=*
12:04 <@jhf:#liferay> (thats it)
12:04 <@jhf:#liferay> this is on 6.1.2 CE GA3
12:05 < jayj:#liferay> may I clarify if this is an issue on GA2?
12:05 < jayj:#liferay> the weird thing is if you have seen the pop up and you login to it
12:05 < jayj:#liferay> you will not be prompt anymore
12:06 <@jhf:#liferay> thats because your browser remembers your credentials
12:06 < jayj:#liferay> im actually using CHrome incognito
12:06 < jayj:#liferay> or even resetting safari everytime I access the service
12:06 < jayj:#liferay> im testing it on FF, Chrome and Safari
12:08 <@jhf:#liferay> well that is a serious browser bug then
12:08 <@jhf:#liferay> if indeed it is the browser remembering.
12:08 <@jhf:#liferay> I would inspect the traffic and see if that is the case.
12:10 < jayj:#liferay> because on my client side i use to get the UserId from the ThemeDisplay
12:10 < jayj:#liferay> and logs it in the console
12:10 < jayj:#liferay> then on my Service Side
12:10 < jayj:#liferay> I use the BaseServiceImpl class
12:10 < jayj:#liferay> to get the userId
12:10 < jayj:#liferay> and on client side its getting the correct login userid
12:11 < jayj:#liferay> but on the server side its getting the one who login in the pop up authentication
12:11 < jayj:#liferay> i've tested this consistently on three browsers
12:11 < jayj:#liferay> using GA2
12:11 < jayj:#liferay> but did not further test on GA3
12:12 < jayj:#liferay> as i just setuo it this morning
12:12 < jayj:#liferay> setup*
12:20 < jayj:#liferay> @jhf : I tested http://localhost:8080/api/jsonws/country/get-countries on my local by removing everything on my portal-ext.properties file and it works even without the 2 override settings
12:21 < jayj:#liferay> this is using my GA3
12:25 <@jhf:#liferay> using curl ? or a browser?
12:25 <@jhf:#liferay> curl is great because you know you don't have any remembered settings that may interfere
12:25 < jayj:#liferay> browser
12:25 <@jhf:#liferay> so which URLs do not work for you?
12:25 < jayj:#liferay> ok ill test it right now thru curl
12:27 < jayj:#liferay> i just put this on my command prompt
12:27 < jayj:#liferay> curl http://localhost:8080/api/secure/jsonws/country/get-countries \   -u test@liferay.com:test
12:27 < jayj:#liferay> with GA3 without something on my portal-ext
12:27 < jayj:#liferay> and its giving me all the countries
12:28 < jayj:#liferay> i removed the settings and restarted the server then test
