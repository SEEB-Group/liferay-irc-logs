08:55 < dblessing:#liferay> morning everyone.
08:55 < dblessing:#liferay> does anyone know how the new mobile menu works? in my new theme which inherits from styled, the mobile menu doesn't work. I'm wondering if there's some class or something that needs added for the nav to get sucked into that mobile menu

10:15 < hufg:#liferay> maan i have made hilarious performance testing scripts for curl
13:23 < kermitt:#liferay> is liferay-plug-package.xml necessary?
13:24 <@jhf:#liferay> nope
13:24 <@jhf:#liferay> in fact all you need is a liferay-plugin-package.properties file
13:24 < kermitt:#liferay> thanks.

13:53 < LRAdminInNeed104:#liferay> Hai
13:54 < LRAdminInNeed104:#liferay> I need one help on Knowledge base search
13:56 < LRAdminInNeed104:#liferay> site member wants to search the articles based on sections
13:57 < LRAdminInNeed104:#liferay> can any body help on this?
14:34 < kermitt:#liferay> I don't think that Lucene/Liferay organizes articles based on sections - you have whole documents ( indices  via Lucene/Solr ) and 'tags' and 'categories' ( via whooever imported the articles in the first place )
14:34 <@jhf:#liferay> I wonder if KB adds search facets though for sections https://www.liferay.com/documentation/liferay-portal/6.1/user-guide/-/ai/knowledge-base

16:22 < dblessing:#liferay> anyone know of any churches using liferay? how about a link to Brian Chan's church site?
16:26 < apucay:#liferay> i don't think his church uses LR any longer
16:29 < dblessing:#liferay> really? that's a bummer.
16:31 < apucay:#liferay> i think it uses cloversites or something: http://www.gatewayfriends.org
16:47 < dblessing:#liferay> oh no! cloversites. :-\
