02:05 < lesnick:#liferay> hi all
02:05 < lesnick:#liferay> could you please provide
02:05 < lesnick:#liferay> any link to work with maven (dynamicwebproject)
02:06 < lesnick:#liferay> that should run on liferay
02:08 < sarath:#liferay> hi all
02:16 < sarath:#liferay> i created dynamic web project with maven..and tried run on liferay server and getting this error"Error configuring application listener of class org.springframework.web.context.ContextLoaderListener"
02:23 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> What exactly do you mean with "tried to run on liferay server"?
02:23 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Did you deploy it as portlet? Is it a hook?
02:23 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Or are you trying to deploy a second application next to Liferay?
02:25 < sarath:#liferay> it is portlet
02:25 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Then you should use the liferay archetype for portlets to create this maven project.
02:26 < sarath:#liferay> i created a simple spring mvc3 portlet with maven as dynamic webproject
02:26 < sarath:#liferay> not as liferay project
02:27 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> You can either use Liferay projects via the Plugin SDK or Maven projects that were created using Liferays archetypes.
02:27 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I don't know if anything else will work.
02:28 < sarath:#liferay> k please tell me in detail how to create a liferay project with maven
02:28 < sarath:#liferay> am new to liferay
02:28 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> http://www.liferay.com/documentation/liferay-portal/6.1/development/-/ai/creating-liferay-plugins-with-maven
02:29 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Is all there in the docs.
02:29 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Way better explained than I ever could. ;)
02:29 < sarath:#liferay> does the doc have how to create liferay project using maven?????????
02:30 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> See the link? Click it.
02:30 < sarath:#liferay> k
02:33 < sarath:#liferay> thanks
02:33 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> You're welcome. Good luck. :)
03:09 < sarath:#liferay> can u help me how to learn spring mvc portlets?
03:13 < sarath:#liferay> iam new to liferay
03:14 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Nope. Sorry. Never used them.
03:15 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> If you can stay a while...usually there are more people here later...some of them might know about that
03:15 < lesnick:#liferay>  ERROR [com.liferay.portal.kernel.deploy.auto.AutoDeployScanner][AutoDeployDir:210] com.liferay.portal.kernel.deploy.auto.AutoDeployException: com.liferay.portal.kernel.deploy.auto.AutoDeployException: web.xml must be updated to the Servlet 2.4 specification
03:16 < lesnick:#liferay> i am getting this error ..
03:22 < sarath:#liferay> did u reslove it
03:31 < lesnick:#liferay> any guess
03:31 < hufg:#liferay> helloo helloo
03:32 < hufg:#liferay> sarath: there is a bug in ga2 for spring mvc portlets (it's a gift)
03:33 < hufg:#liferay> uh uh it clearly states you need to update to 2.4 spec
03:33 < hufg:#liferay> <web-app version="2.4" see that in web.xml
03:33 < sarath:#liferay> iam also getting the same error
03:33 < hufg:#liferay> do you actually know something about servlets and portlets and web applications?
03:33 < hufg:#liferay> you should read up on them first
03:35 < sarath:#liferay> i knew servlets and jsp
03:35 < sarath:#liferay> but i don't know spring mvc portlets
03:39 < hufg:#liferay> http://www.liferay.com/web/mika.koivisto/blog/-/blogs/getting-started-with-liferay-maven-sdk
03:40 < hufg:#liferay> anyways ga2 has a bug for spring mvc portlets which will mess with your listener order in web.xml
03:40 < hufg:#liferay> they will not work without fixing the order
04:01 < hufg:#liferay> someone should make a project for liferay ui fixes via hook
04:01 < hufg:#liferay> like a community maintained
04:02 < hufg:#liferay> it's so simple to do tweaks to fix stuff
04:02 < hufg:#liferay> like the goddamned delete missing pages bug which will delete the whole site
04:02 < hufg:#liferay> needs just a modification for single line of jsp
04:03 < hufg:#liferay> we have a fix hook project and i can just bang out simple tweaks which really help
04:04 < hufg:#liferay> and with it could have multiple maven projects and some pom magic you could just build your own fix hook in plugin style
04:04 < hufg:#liferay> -and with
04:04 < hufg:#liferay> now that would be something
04:06 < hufg:#liferay> like how many use the workflow? probably quite many. how many of them want to access my workflow tasks with a single click from admin ui? i bet all of them
04:07 < hufg:#liferay> you can do that shit in half a day
04:11 < hufg:#liferay> aand aand how many would want to streamline staging publishing which is essentially only a matter of get post params
04:11 < hufg:#liferay> the publishing ui doesn't even have an ui, everything is jsut thrown into the screen and i don't call that ui design
04:51 < lesnick:#liferay> ok but i am using plugin installer to upload it ..in one article given that remove web.xml so where to change this servlet version
05:01 < sarath:#liferay> can anyone help me how to write a simple application using spring mvc portlets
05:01 -!- mode/#liferay [+o jhf] by ChanServ
05:18 < sarath:#liferay> while running the project i getting this error..."Error running SDK command war"
05:22 < sarath:#liferay> can anyone help me how to reslove the error
05:24 < lesnick:#liferay> which version of sdk are you using
05:29 < sarath:#liferay> 6.1.1
05:33 < sarath:#liferay> sdk6.1.1
08:15 < hufg:#liferay> anyone ever done performance tests with wget? :D
08:46 < nikiforo:#liferay> hi
08:46 < nikiforo:#liferay> If anybody have something similar
08:47 < nikiforo:#liferay> I deploy a hook to a liferay. And I get an error:
08:47 < nikiforo:#liferay> com.liferay.portal.kernel.deploy.hot.HotDeployException: Error registering hook for demo-hook com.liferay.portal.kernel.deploy.hot.HotDeployException: Error registering hook for demo-hook
08:47 < nikiforo:#liferay> a big stacktrace
08:47 < nikiforo:#liferay> then:
08:47 < nikiforo:#liferay> Caused by: java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: com/sun/image/codec/jpeg/ImageFormatException
08:48 < nikiforo:#liferay> I've solved similar problems with JBoss by adding packages to module.xml
08:48 < nikiforo:#liferay> Now I'm using tomcat Liferay bundle
08:48 < nikiforo:#liferay> Any ideas?
09:09 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Hey guys...does somebody know if it is possible to set a fixed id for a theme? Currently we always end up with a theme id xxxx_WAR_yyyyy, where yyyyy contains e.g. the version string that was in the .war filename.
09:10 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Why would it include the name of the .war there? Shouldn't the theme have some unique identifier?
09:13 < darkos:#liferay> hey there @jhf
09:14 < darkos:#liferay> question for you
09:15 < darkos:#liferay> are you aware of any issues with dynamic data lists regarding using forms, that would cause form submissions to not post the expected data to the ddl ?
09:15 < darkos:#liferay> I seem to be having exactly that happen.
09:48 < hufg:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur: uhuh yes there should be
09:52 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> In liferay-look-and-feel.xml there is a <theme id="xxx" name="Something">
09:53 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> But the ID we specify there is suffixed with _WAR_yyyyyy when I deploy the theme.
09:54 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> It also shows up exactly like that in the themeId field of the DB table Layouts.
09:54 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> *Layout
10:07 < hufg:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur: do you have liferay-plugin-package.properties in WEB-INF
10:07 < hufg:#liferay> try adding it if you dont
10:23 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> There is one, yes.
10:24 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> But there is no liferay-plugin-properties.xml, which is always printed as a warning during deployment.
10:30 < hufg:#liferay> we solved similiarlish problem by adding required configuration files
10:35 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I just read through the documentation on how to build a theme properly.
10:36 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Now I'd really love to throw this mess out the window create it from scratch. :-(
10:36 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Such a mess...and totally unnecessary.
10:42 <@jhf:#liferay> darkos:
10:42 <@jhf:#liferay> I'm not aware of a DDL-specific thing.. is this with 6.2?
10:42 <@jhf:#liferay> did you search the bug db?
