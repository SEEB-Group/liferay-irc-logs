13:12 < jardinworks:#liferay> jhf: rotty3000 .. do either of you know what "companyGroupId" refers to?
13:25 <@rotty3000:#liferay> I think there's a group created per company
13:25 <@rotty3000:#liferay> iirc
13:26 <@rotty3000:#liferay> for the global scope content and such
13:26 <@rotty3000:#liferay> since content is always associated with a group
