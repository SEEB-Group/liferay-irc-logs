03:07 < Axxell:#liferay> hey guys, having trouble with recently working ldap integration in liferay..
03:08 < Axxell:#liferay> because of no particular reason, liferay does not control ldap password with bind, instead it seems to store the password, and only authenticates with a prior password
03:08 < Axxell:#liferay> what could be the problem?

10:53 < jardinworks:#liferay> :(
10:53 < jardinworks:#liferay> makes me sad jhf
10:53 < jardinworks:#liferay> when is your last day?

10:55 < jardinworks:#liferay> I see
10:55 < jardinworks:#liferay> sigh
10:56 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah……. mixed emotions.
10:56 < jardinworks:#liferay> how many years did you have at LR?
10:56 <@jhf:#liferay> 5+
10:56 < jardineworks:#liferay> damn
10:56 <@jhf:#liferay> it was a good run.
10:56 < jardineworks:#liferay> no kidding
10:56 < jardineworks:#liferay> is there someone officially taking over for you?
10:57 < jardineworks:#liferay> not that you are so easily replaced or anything :)
10:57 < jardineworks:#liferay> but LR does have a lot of talented folks
10:57 <@jhf:#liferay> Liferay is going to form an advisory board (and I’ll be a part of it)
10:57 <@jhf:#liferay> https://www.liferay.com/web/james.falkner/blog/-/blogs/the-future-of-the-liferay-community
10:57 <@jhf:#liferay> so I’m not totally doing a mic drop and walking away
10:59 <@jhf:#liferay> my new management is in boston.. so if you ever find yourself bored one day and want to drive down...
11:00 < rotty3000:#liferay> hey all... if it were possible to ask everyone to stand up and sing "For he's a jolly good fellow", I would!!!
11:01 < rotty3000:#liferay> but a tremendous thanks to jhf for all his time and energy to make this community great
11:01 <@jhf:#liferay> \o/
