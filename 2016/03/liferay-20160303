16:41 < jardinworks:#liferay> jhf: rotty3000 -- do you guys know if there is an easy way to apply a theme to all child pages? When the pages have already been created I mean?
16:42 <@jhf:#liferay> cant you define a theme for the entire site, which is applied to all pages (including ones already created)?
16:43 <@rotty3000:#liferay> jmh <- +1
16:43 <@rotty3000:#liferay> jhf <- +1
16:47 < jardinworks:#liferay> jhf: In THEORY. What I have is this situation. Created a site. In the Private Pages section there are 200 pages in a hierarchy. If I go to the Private Pages element under the look and feel, yes I can say "use this for all private pages"
16:47 < jardinworks:#liferay> but it doesn't seem to apply it the pages are already created.
