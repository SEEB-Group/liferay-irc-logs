10:18 < Andrea_____:#liferay> hi all, whats the purpose of GLOBAL SITE in liferay?
10:23 < njuneau:#liferay> Andrea_____: It has many uses, one of them being to hold any content that is not specifically tied to a single site
10:24 < Andrea_____:#liferay> when you say "content" are you talking about the structures and templates ? thanks for the fast response
10:26 < njuneau:#liferay> Andrea_____: Yes, structures and templates. But not only that. Pretty much anything you put in the Global site can be shared in some way with the company's sites
10:27 < njuneau:#liferay> Andrea_____: Some data may not be available, but the best way to know is to try
10:29 < njuneau:#liferay> Andrea_____: This should help you sort things out : https://dev.liferay.com/participate/liferaypedia/-/wiki/Main/scope
10:29 < Andrea_____:#liferay> thank you very much njuneau
10:30 < njuneau:#liferay> Andrea_____: Pleasure :)

14:43 < Andrea_____:#liferay> hi all, how can i deny the portal administrator to change passwords of users?
14:44 < Andrea_____:#liferay> EDIT* hi all, how can i deny the portal administrator the ability to change passwords of users?
14:45 <@rotty3000:#liferay> I'm asking around, my gut feeling is no... but not sure
14:45 <@rotty3000:#liferay> I mean, the admin can be set to only set a one time password
