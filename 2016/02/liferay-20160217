10:39 < Adalid_Negro:#liferay> Hi
10:39 < Adalid_Negro:#liferay> achereli: =)
10:39 < achereli:#liferay> I just joined the channel to see if it existed. I don't run liferay, so I'm out.
10:40 < Adalid_Negro:#liferay> someone wants to help me with an issue that a server is using a 99% of RAM
10:40 < Adalid_Negro:#liferay> And I don't know exactly how find the cause
14:27 < njuneau:#liferay> Adalid_Negro: There are a number of circumstances under witch 99% of the RAM may be taken. I cannot help you, but if you know that memory usage is 99% due to a Java process, try performing a heap dump and analyze it to know get clues
14:28 < jardinworks:#liferay> njuneau: you around for a discussion about build process + build servers?
14:34 < njuneau:#liferay> jardinworks: Would love to, but I'm a bit overwhelmed ATM
14:47 < jardinworks:#liferay> njuneau: booo
14:57 < njuneau:#liferay> jardinworks: sorry ;)
15:00 < rochadt:#liferay> hello everyone
