12:14 < TommyTheKid:#liferay> Hi I have an "inherited" problem... custom portal app built on liferay, hosted on jboss 4.0.3 SP1. It (jboss) was compromised, so we have directive to upgrade the jboss portion, tried just sticking in on wildfire10, but its not starting... Is there a compatibility matrix somewhere? (and how can I find out what version of liferay I am running without being able to login to it)
12:15 < jardineworks_:#liferay> TommyTheKid: there is -- one sec, let me see if I can find it. I'm not sure that Wildfly is on it though.
12:16 < jardineworks_:#liferay> TommyTheKid: https://www.liferay.com/documents/14/21598941/Liferay+Portal+6.2+EE+Compatibility+Matrix.pdf/3b3fd878-c954-4acc-bd5f-19fb7eb78210
12:16 < jardineworks_:#liferay> 7.1 is the max it seems
12:16 < jardineworks_:#liferay> 8 was the introduction of Wildfly right?
12:17 < TommyTheKid:#liferay> right.
12:18 < jardineworks_:#liferay> TommyTheKid: wildfly is meant for Java 8 if I remember correctly right?
12:18 < TommyTheKid:#liferay> and of course Wildfly 8 is no longer supported by wildlfy, and with 10 recently being released, 9.x is probably also EOL
12:18 < TommyTheKid:#liferay> jardineworks_:  Wildfly 10 dropped support for Java 7
12:18 < jardineworks_:#liferay> is that is right then that is you principle problem. Liferay 6.2 does not support Java 8
12:18 < jardineworks_:#liferay> ah
12:18 < jardineworks_:#liferay> then it should be possible
12:18 < jardineworks_:#liferay> what errors are you getting?
12:19 < TommyTheKid:#liferay> basically a bunch of no class def found errors, ... first a bunch of "WARN" messages complaining about the class-path in the WAR files
12:20 < TommyTheKid:#liferay> as I stated, its an inherited problem from ~2005, so its not likely that it is 6.2 either
12:20 < jardineworks_:#liferay> do you know which version of LR is on it?
12:21 < TommyTheKid:#liferay> no, is there a way to find it? running strings against a class file or something?
12:22 < jardineworks_:#liferay> hmmm
12:22 < jardineworks_:#liferay> do you know if there is a "control panel"? fo rexample... if you go to localhost:8080/group/control_panel does that resolve ?
12:22 < TommyTheKid:#liferay> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liferay <-- that only goes back to 2008 :(
12:23 < jardineworks_:#liferay> lol
