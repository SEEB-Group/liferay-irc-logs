12:14 < TommyTheKid:#liferay> Hi I have an "inherited" problem... custom portal app built on liferay, hosted on jboss 4.0.3 SP1. It (jboss) was compromised, so we have directive to upgrade the jboss portion, tried just sticking in on wildfire10, but its not starting... Is there a compatibility matrix somewhere? (and how can I find out what version of liferay I am running without being able to login to it)
12:15 < jardineworks_:#liferay> TommyTheKid: there is -- one sec, let me see if I can find it. I'm not sure that Wildfly is on it though.
12:16 < jardineworks_:#liferay> TommyTheKid: https://www.liferay.com/documents/14/21598941/Liferay+Portal+6.2+EE+Compatibility+Matrix.pdf/3b3fd878-c954-4acc-bd5f-19fb7eb78210
12:16 < jardineworks_:#liferay> 7.1 is the max it seems
12:16 < jardineworks_:#liferay> 8 was the introduction of Wildfly right?
12:17 < TommyTheKid:#liferay> right.
12:18 < jardineworks_:#liferay> TommyTheKid: wildfly is meant for Java 8 if I remember correctly right?
12:18 < TommyTheKid:#liferay> and of course Wildfly 8 is no longer supported by wildlfy, and with 10 recently being released, 9.x is probably also EOL
12:18 < TommyTheKid:#liferay> jardineworks_:  Wildfly 10 dropped support for Java 7
12:18 < jardineworks_:#liferay> is that is right then that is you principle problem. Liferay 6.2 does not support Java 8
12:18 < jardineworks_:#liferay> ah
12:18 < jardineworks_:#liferay> then it should be possible
12:18 < jardineworks_:#liferay> what errors are you getting?
12:19 < TommyTheKid:#liferay> basically a bunch of no class def found errors, ... first a bunch of "WARN" messages complaining about the class-path in the WAR files
12:20 < TommyTheKid:#liferay> as I stated, its an inherited problem from ~2005, so its not likely that it is 6.2 either
12:20 < jardineworks_:#liferay> do you know which version of LR is on it?
12:21 < TommyTheKid:#liferay> no, is there a way to find it? running strings against a class file or something?
12:22 < jardineworks_:#liferay> hmmm
12:22 < jardineworks_:#liferay> do you know if there is a "control panel"? fo rexample... if you go to localhost:8080/group/control_panel does that resolve ?
12:22 < TommyTheKid:#liferay> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liferay <-- that only goes back to 2008 :(
12:23 < jardineworks_:#liferay> lol
12:23 < jardineworks_:#liferay> the product is about 13 years old... so it's older than the wiki :)
12:23 < TommyTheKid:#liferay> 404
12:25 < jardineworks_:#liferay> that might mean your version is pre 5.2.3 ... which I think is when they introduced the control panel
12:25 < jardineworks_:#liferay> damn
12:25 < jardineworks_:#liferay> that's some old shit
12:25 < jardineworks_:#liferay> what are you doing with it?!
12:25 < jardineworks_:#liferay> lol
12:26 < TommyTheKid:#liferay> well preexisting portal taht does some reports, got compromised due to a JBOSS 4.0.3 issue (JMX is exposed), and we are trying to make it work on a newer AS
12:27 < TommyTheKid:#liferay> we tried copying the ear/war files over to the new one... had to fix an XML issue (something about jsp-config and taglib), now just dealing with class-path issues
12:27 < jardineworks_:#liferay> TommyTheKid: you could open the portal-impl.jar and check inside META-INF .. the MANIFEST.MF
12:27 < jardineworks_:#liferay> look for a bundle version
12:35 < TommyTheKid:#liferay> that file doesn't exist, I think they packaged it inside a war, inside an ear, but even after running updatedb on a "deployed" (working) version we don't see that jar file
12:36 < TommyTheKid:#liferay> either way, we know its pre-5.0 :)
12:39 < TommyTheKid:#liferay> I am thinking the "warninig" messages about "Class Path entry portal-ejb.jar in (path-to-warfile-inside-ear-file) does not point to a valid jar for a Class-Path reference ... sorta like the manifest format changed
12:41 < TommyTheKid:#liferay> I do note that the Class-Path just says "lib/whatever.jar" and its actually in WEB-INF/lib/whatever.jar ... but it works on the previous server (jboss 4.0.3SP1)
13:21 < njuneau:#liferay> jardineworks_, TommyTheKid: 6.2 EE does support Java 8
13:21 < njuneau:#liferay> jardineworks_, TommyTheKid: It's supported, but not certified
13:22 < TommyTheKid:#liferay> sortof cool, but we are really in a difficult position, as we are on something pre-5.0 (circa 2005)
13:23 < njuneau:#liferay> That's indeed a bit old ;)
13:24 < njuneau:#liferay> And you have a double problem there. you have a pre-JBoss AS instance :P
13:24 < njuneau:#liferay> Just migrating that is gonna be a challenge
13:24 < TommyTheKid:#liferay> yea, and I have been looking and it appears that jboss made *masive* changes to the way war/jar/ear files are loaded in 7.x
13:24 < TommyTheKid:#liferay> right.
13:24 < njuneau:#liferay> Yes. AS7 is an almost complete rewrite of the stack
13:25 < njuneau:#liferay> They introduced the module system which isolates the libraries in their own classloaders
13:25 < TommyTheKid:#liferay> that would probably explain all the NoClassDefFoundError(s)
13:25 < njuneau:#liferay> Which could explain a lot of "Class not found" if the module dependencies aren't correctly set
13:25 < njuneau:#liferay> LR6.2 actually includes, if I'm not mistaken, a "jboss-deployment-structure" XML file defining the needed JBoss modules to properly function
13:26 < njuneau:#liferay> It's actually a pretty cool system, just a bit uncommon in regards to other application servers
13:26 < TommyTheKid:#liferay> I wonder if we should fall back to tomcat?
13:27 < njuneau:#liferay> I don't know your whole situation so take this comment with a huge grain of sea salt, it depends on which features you need out of your app server
13:27 < njuneau:#liferay> Or on which stack the people working with you are most familiar with
13:28 < njuneau:#liferay> If you're looking for a replacement, Java EE-wize, to JBoss AS, Glassfish, Apache TomEE or Geronimo is probably closer to what Tomcat provides
13:28 < TommyTheKid:#liferay> ... since we could install tomcat or tomcat6 from EL packages :)
13:28 < TommyTheKid:#liferay> we are not familiar with either or any of them
13:29 < TommyTheKid:#liferay> we basically have an old "portal" that needs to keep running, but is running a vulnerable jboss (4.0.3sp1) and a scary old version of java :)
13:30 < njuneau:#liferay> For LR6.2, there's a "Release_" table in the database
13:30 < njuneau:#liferay> Maybe there's an equivalent on yours that could indicate the Liferay Portal version you're dealing with
13:30 < TommyTheKid:#liferay> how bout like 1.0? :p
13:30 < njuneau:#liferay> hehe
13:30 < TommyTheKid:#liferay> I think that was added "recently" (saw something about it in my past googlings)
13:31 < njuneau:#liferay> hmmm
13:31 < njuneau:#liferay> then I guess you'll have to go hunting for release notes and changelogs ;)
13:33 < TommyTheKid:#liferay> ooh we might be on 3.x of LifeRay
13:33 < TommyTheKid:#liferay> https://sourceforge.net/projects/lportal/files/Liferay%20Portal/
13:34 < jardineworks_:#liferay> TommyTheKid:you said you can explode the ear file right?
13:35 < TommyTheKid:#liferay> it is a "directory" :) ... so yea :)
13:35 < jardineworks_:#liferay> does your JBoss config explode deployments for you automatically?
13:38 < jardineworks_:#liferay> TommyTheKid: is Liferay installed as the root context?
13:44 < TommyTheKid:#liferay> I think it may be /main, but the web server takes care of the redirect
13:46 < TommyTheKid:#liferay> there are *several* contexts ... I believe there are ~8 WAR files and an EAR file that has several war files in it, not sure which are required and which are "legacy" :)
13:48 < jardineworks_:#liferay> can you run a find operation on your server and see if you can find the portal-impl.jar?
13:48 < jardineworks_:#liferay> assuming it was still called that in the stone ages, when you installed LR :)
15:31 < TommyTheKid:#liferay> jardineworks_:  sorry I apparently wandered off... I did, there is no portal-impl.jar
15:32 < TommyTheKid:#liferay> and I think that jboss explodes all the wars
15:32 < jardineworks_:#liferay> TommyTheKid: shoot -- sorry man you are going farther back in time than my Liferay experience takes me
15:38 < TommyTheKid:#liferay> all good, I think we are giving up on jboss (wildfly), may try tomcat, but may need to look into other things that can handle the war/ear files
15:39 < TommyTheKid:#liferay> (directories in most cases)
