09:00 < njuneau:#liferay> jardinworks: if you want to have that discussion about build processes, I could make it at 12:00
09:00 < njuneau:#liferay> jardinworks: ;)
09:21 < jardinworks:#liferay> njuneau: my day has just started and it already looks like a train wreck -- but maybe? Just to give some context -- it's about using build servers (like Jenkins, Team City, Bamboo etc) with Service Builder (Maven) projects.
09:22 < jardinworks:#liferay> ... and whether you commit your SB generated code to your source control, or let the build process generated it
09:23 < njuneau:#liferay> jardinworks: We always try to leave everything generated out of source control if (and that's a big if) Maven can generate it automatically as part of the build lifecycle
09:25 < njuneau:#liferay> jardinworks: Regarding SB specifically, that would be on a per-project basis - I'm not a big fan of committing generated interfaces and boilerplate if maven can take care of it. But I can see that creating problems if the Maven Lifecycle doesn't take care of that generation properly
09:26 < njuneau:#liferay> jardinworks: First example that comes to mind is people using an IDE like Eclipse in which some Maven lifecycle phases would be always called at the right time (if ever)
09:26 < njuneau:#liferay> jardinworks: However, with Jenkins, the build lifecycle should be pretty much complete
