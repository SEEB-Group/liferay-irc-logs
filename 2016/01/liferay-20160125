09:50 <@jhf:#liferay> meera: ! welcome
09:50 < meera:#liferay> hi thank you...
09:55 <@jhf:#liferay> ok we'll do the drawing in 5 minutes, but I need a volunteer - anyone (other than meera) willing to help out?
09:57 <@jhf:#liferay> is lauri here?
09:59 <@jhf:#liferay> denissignoretto: ! welcome
09:59 < denissignoretto:#liferay> hi James !
10:00 < meera:#liferay> Hi  denissignoretto... Nice to see you here..
10:00 <@jhf:#liferay> ok we will use a secure hash algorithm to pick the winner :)
10:00 < meera:#liferay> okay
10:00 <@jhf:#liferay> I will create a String which contains everyone's name and a number associated with each name
10:01 < denissignoretto:#liferay> Hi everybody ! (I'm a bit busy at the moment, but I can follow your messages !)
10:01 <@jhf:#liferay> for example "1=Bob,2=Prashant,3=Alice"
10:01 < meera:#liferay> ok
10:01 <@jhf:#liferay> I will then pass this through a secure hash and tell you what the hash value is (e.g. using SHA-1)
10:01 < meera:#liferay> ok
10:01 <@jhf:#liferay> then I'll ask a volunteer to choose a number from 1 to 3
10:02 <@jhf:#liferay> then I will reveal the string and the winner, which lets you independently verify that it was the right string
10:02 < meera:#liferay> ok
10:02 <@jhf:#liferay> it's not 100% foolproof (I could for example privately tell the volunteer which number to choose)
10:02 <@jhf:#liferay> but it's good enough, and I hope you have enough trust in me to know I won't cheat :)
10:03 <@jhf:#liferay> since no one else seems to be here at the moment I'll ask Meera to choose the number
10:03 < denissignoretto:#liferay> I trust you jhf ! ;)
10:03 < meera:#liferay> ha ha ha .. we trust you always
10:03 < meera:#liferay> may i Know numbers
10:04 <@jhf:#liferay> ok here is the SHA-256 hash of the list of winners: c8af78fc6e19ea97c8bc48a6d304b978e3afd4695c16db67ad43c7bf1e08caa0
10:04 <@jhf:#liferay> now, meera - choose a number: 1, 2, or 3.
10:05 < denissignoretto:#liferay> :O
10:05 <@jhf:#liferay> choose wisely
10:05 < meera:#liferay> I go for 2
10:05 <@jhf:#liferay> :)
10:05 <@jhf:#liferay> and the winner is.................................
10:05 < meera:#liferay> who?..........
10:05 <@jhf:#liferay> LAURI HILTUNEN!!!!
10:05 < meera:#liferay> ha ha ha
10:05 <@jhf:#liferay> echo -n '1=Denis,2=Lauri,3=Meera' | openssl sha256
10:05 <@jhf:#liferay> (if you want to verify)
10:05 < denissignoretto:#liferay> HEI LAURI congrats !
10:05 < meera:#liferay> Congratulation  HEI LAURI
10:06 < meera:#liferay> he should thanks to me.. ha ha ha
10:06 <@jhf:#liferay> Lauri works for Ambientia in Finland and will hopefully be happy he won!!
10:06 <@jhf:#liferay> thanks meera, sorry it wasn't you today :(
10:06 < meera:#liferay> ha ha no problem...
10:08 < rashxt:#liferay> hi all, I have a question about ldap users. can I ask ?
10:09 <@jhf:#liferay> rashxt: go for it.. can't promise we'll have answers :)
10:09 <@jhf:#liferay> but there are lots of posts on our forums (liferay.com/forums) and stack overflow regarding LDAP
10:10 < jardinworks:#liferay> rashxt: of course!
10:10 < rashxt:#liferay> in our ldap user has a custom field calles "abilitazione", I wrote an hook overriding UserLocalService but in method getUser of my hook I don't know how to get my custom field ("abilitazione")
10:10 < jardinworks:#liferay> rashxt: you want to get the user based on the expando field?
10:11 <@jhf:#liferay> isn't it osmething like user.getExpandoBridge().getAttribute("abilitazione")
10:12 < rashxt:#liferay> @jhf I tried but my field is null
10:12 < rashxt:#liferay> all expando is empty
10:12 < jardinworks:#liferay> rashxt: does the user you are testing with have the value set?
10:12 <@jhf:#liferay> how are you inserting the value into the expando field? I don't think the LDAP import process inserts values into expando
10:13 < rashxt:#liferay> on LDAP yes
10:13 < rashxt:#liferay> @jhf do I have to do it programmatically ?
10:14 < jardinworks:#liferay> rashxt: "on LDAP yes" wast that for me? as in in LDAP there is a value? but I want you to check the User object in the control panel. If you edit the user and check the Custom Fields section... do you see the value set?
10:14 < rashxt:#liferay> jardinworks: no, in CP no custom fields visible
10:15 < jardinworks:#liferay> rashxt: that is why it is empty then. There is no value set for the user. So you need to figure out why the mapping didn't take.
10:16 < jardinworks:#liferay> Have a look at the PortalLDAPImporterImpl.java clas
10:16 < jardinworks:#liferay> that will hel pyou understand how the users are created in liferay, based on what is in your directory store + mappings.
10:16 <@jhf:#liferay> also there are many people that have done the same thing - see this for example: https://www.liferay.com/community/forums/-/message_boards/message/32555219
10:17 <@jhf:#liferay> it looks like it IS posible to make Liferay import stuff to expando for you
10:18 < rashxt:#liferay> trying this: https://www.liferay.com/it/community/forums/-/message_boards/message/32555219
10:18 < rashxt:#liferay> thanks for the tip
10:18 < rashxt:#liferay> I will let you know if it is working, thanks guys
10:23 < de_coeur:#liferay> Just back from the gym, I won!? Great, thanks James and thank you meera! :)
10:34 <@jhf:#liferay> de_coeur: !!
10:34 <@jhf:#liferay> yes you won! I'll contact you via email to follow up.
