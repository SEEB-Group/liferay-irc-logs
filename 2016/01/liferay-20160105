09:30 < hufg:#liferay> hello!
09:31 < hufg:#liferay> any ideas how to wrap liferay struts actions?
09:32 < hufg:#liferay> overriding is a bit suck since they might be overridden somewhere else :Z
09:32 < hufg:#liferay> though maybe this is not such a big problem
09:33 < jardineworks:#liferay> hufg: I think the convention for wrapping struts actions is just to provide an override and then call the original struts action.
09:34 < jardineworks:#liferay> you are right though, you can have conflicts...
09:34 < hufg:#liferay> yeah i guess i have to leave the possible conflicts for the next guys eheh
09:34 < jardineworks:#liferay> my mechanism for dealing is to try to keep all my hooks in one project when I can.
09:34 < hufg:#liferay> two years down to road or whatever
09:34 < jardineworks:#liferay> haha
09:34 < jardineworks:#liferay> good reason to migrate to LR7!
09:34 < hufg:#liferay> yes maybe struts-overrides-hook
09:34 < jardineworks:#liferay> :)
09:34 < hufg:#liferay> but this creates other troubles
09:35 < jardineworks:#liferay> LR7 or a common hook project?
09:35 < hufg:#liferay> hehe cmon
09:35 < hufg:#liferay> i can imagine the headache to migrate to LR7
09:36 < hufg:#liferay> i've yet to hear about a cheap(non time consuming) liferay major version upgrades
09:36 < jardineworks:#liferay> oh -- yeah and I think you are on 6.1 right?
09:36 < hufg:#liferay> hehe no more!
09:37 < hufg:#liferay> i'm actually doing consulting atm so the versions depend on the project
09:37 < hufg:#liferay> but mostly latest and gratest 6.2
10:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> hufg: then you might now be too bad. I saw some stuff at the LRNAS2015 in chicago that showed some pretty awesome work LR has done to automate some of the upgrading.
10:12 < hufg:#liferay> yeah who knows maybe it will be better
10:12 < hufg:#liferay> but the fact is, it is a super hard problem
