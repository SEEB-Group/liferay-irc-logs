09:30 < hufg:#liferay> hello!
09:31 < hufg:#liferay> any ideas how to wrap liferay struts actions?
09:32 < hufg:#liferay> overriding is a bit suck since they might be overridden somewhere else :Z
09:32 < hufg:#liferay> though maybe this is not such a big problem
09:33 < jardineworks:#liferay> hufg: I think the convention for wrapping struts actions is just to provide an override and then call the original struts action.
09:34 < jardineworks:#liferay> you are right though, you can have conflicts...
09:34 < hufg:#liferay> yeah i guess i have to leave the possible conflicts for the next guys eheh
09:34 < jardineworks:#liferay> my mechanism for dealing is to try to keep all my hooks in one project when I can.
09:34 < hufg:#liferay> two years down to road or whatever
09:34 < jardineworks:#liferay> haha
09:34 < jardineworks:#liferay> good reason to migrate to LR7!
09:34 < hufg:#liferay> yes maybe struts-overrides-hook
09:34 < jardineworks:#liferay> :)
09:34 < hufg:#liferay> but this creates other troubles
