08:21 < whatsoever:#liferay> hi, anyone working with liferay 6.20? i have alot of problems with it :-(
08:27 < jardineworks:#liferay> whatsoever, I haven't started with it yet -- hoping too shortly. What kind of problems are you having?
08:27 < whatsoever:#liferay> kinda nothing is working, i am using ga1, cant do anything in control center :/
08:28 < whatsoever:#liferay> it always says: "not found   the requested resource was not found "
08:30 < whatsoever:#liferay> hmm well havent work with liferay for half a year and was pretty excited about the new version.. which one is the last stable one? need it for my work :-/
08:32 < hufg_:#liferay> :Z
08:34 < jardineworks:#liferay> whatsoever, I am working with 6.1.2 GA3. Its not perfect but I have only come across a few major issues. Could be though that I am not using the more unstable peices.
08:35 < whatsoever:#liferay> ok i will try that
08:35 < hufg_:#liferay> yeah that is probably the most stable
08:35 < hufg_:#liferay> jardineworks:did you upgrade from ga2?
08:35 < jardineworks:#liferay> whatsoever, I would recommend tunring the logging up on your 6.2 to see if you can get something a little more detailed for output. Seems odd that you would be getting that
08:35 < jardineworks:#liferay> hufg, We went from 6.1.1 GA2 to 6.1.2 GA3
08:35 < hufg_:#liferay> no issues with dl?
08:35 < hufg_:#liferay> or ahh you don't have staging/publishing?
08:35 < jardineworks:#liferay> I have a few issues in the CP as well, but I think mine might be related to other browser plugins.
08:36 < whatsoever:#liferay> http://sourceforge.net/projects/lportal/files/Liferay%20Portal/6.1.2%20GA3/   <- 2nd link?
08:36 < jardineworks:#liferay> right now we aren't using the stage/publish
08:36 < jardineworks:#liferay> and our DL is really limited to just some images that are used in content.
08:37 < whatsoever:#liferay> + theres only plugins sdk for 6.1.1 ?
08:37 < hufg_:#liferay> jardineworks:ahh yes it's because of lack of stage/publish
08:38 < hufg_:#liferay> whatsoever:hmm?
08:38 < hufg_:#liferay> whatsoever:cmon man you can find the correct package
08:38 < hufg_:#liferay> etc
08:39 < whatsoever:#liferay> am i really that blind? -_-
