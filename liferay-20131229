08:21 < whatsoever:#liferay> hi, anyone working with liferay 6.20? i have alot of problems with it :-(
08:27 < jardineworks:#liferay> whatsoever, I haven't started with it yet -- hoping too shortly. What kind of problems are you having?
08:27 < whatsoever:#liferay> kinda nothing is working, i am using ga1, cant do anything in control center :/
08:28 < whatsoever:#liferay> it always says: "not found   the requested resource was not found "
08:30 < whatsoever:#liferay> hmm well havent work with liferay for half a year and was pretty excited about the new version.. which one is the last stable one? need it for my work :-/
08:32 < hufg_:#liferay> :Z
08:34 < jardineworks:#liferay> whatsoever, I am working with 6.1.2 GA3. Its not perfect but I have only come across a few major issues. Could be though that I am not using the more unstable peices.
08:35 < whatsoever:#liferay> ok i will try that
08:35 < hufg_:#liferay> yeah that is probably the most stable
08:35 < hufg_:#liferay> jardineworks:did you upgrade from ga2?
08:35 < jardineworks:#liferay> whatsoever, I would recommend tunring the logging up on your 6.2 to see if you can get something a little more detailed for output. Seems odd that you would be getting that
08:35 < jardineworks:#liferay> hufg, We went from 6.1.1 GA2 to 6.1.2 GA3
08:35 < hufg_:#liferay> no issues with dl?
08:35 < hufg_:#liferay> or ahh you don't have staging/publishing?
08:35 < jardineworks:#liferay> I have a few issues in the CP as well, but I think mine might be related to other browser plugins.
08:36 < whatsoever:#liferay> http://sourceforge.net/projects/lportal/files/Liferay%20Portal/6.1.2%20GA3/   <- 2nd link?
08:36 < jardineworks:#liferay> right now we aren't using the stage/publish
08:36 < jardineworks:#liferay> and our DL is really limited to just some images that are used in content.
08:37 < whatsoever:#liferay> + theres only plugins sdk for 6.1.1 ?
08:37 < hufg_:#liferay> jardineworks:ahh yes it's because of lack of stage/publish
08:38 < hufg_:#liferay> whatsoever:hmm?
08:38 < hufg_:#liferay> whatsoever:cmon man you can find the correct package
08:38 < hufg_:#liferay> etc
08:39 < whatsoever:#liferay> am i really that blind? -_-
08:40 < hufg_:#liferay> i have only 3.5 days left on liferay
08:40 < hufg_:#liferay> then no computer stuff for a year
08:40 < whatsoever:#liferay> fyl ^_^
08:41 < whatsoever:#liferay> well i really dont find the sdk for 6.1.2 o_O
08:43 < hufg_:#liferay> github then?
08:43 < hufg_:#liferay> or perhaps maven plugins?
08:43 < whatsoever:#liferay> well now i am totally confused
08:45 < whatsoever:#liferay> i was used to use tomcat + sdk
08:46 < hufg_:#liferay> me too
08:46 < hufg_:#liferay> isn't the sdk some commandline tools and ant builds
08:47 < whatsoever:#liferay> well i never did it the old way... just used eclipse, added server and sdk and it worked ^_^
08:49 < whatsoever:#liferay> ok just found a thread that 6.1.2 sdk isnt for free -_-
08:49 < whatsoever:#liferay> jardineworks : do you have a license or how did you manage it?
08:50 < jardineworks:#liferay> 6.1.1 works with 6.1.2
08:50 < jardineworks:#liferay> sdk I mean
08:50 < whatsoever:#liferay> ok
08:50 < jardineworks:#liferay> I was looking for it too then I found a post on the forum that said you use the same one :)
08:50 < whatsoever:#liferay> just change liferay-plugin-package.properties ?
08:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> but you have to make sure your plugin configuration is 6.1.1+ compatible (as a setting)
08:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> whatsoever, right
08:51 < hufg_:#liferay> what do you do with the sdk?
08:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> pretty sure I have incompatible version errors on deployment before I changed it (even though I changed nothing else)
08:52 < whatsoever:#liferay> ok
08:52 < whatsoever:#liferay> ill try
08:52 < whatsoever:#liferay> if its not working, ill just use 6.1.1
08:56 < hufg_:#liferay> i think i will try to device some uber hack to fix the ga2 dl+staging+publishing to ga3
09:06 < jardineworks:#liferay> hufg, if you can find the fix in the 6.2 code, you might be able to backport it as an ext plugin
09:08 < hufg_:#liferay> hehe yeah but ext plugin is zz ozz
09:08 < hufg_:#liferay> pzz
10:58 < whatsoever_:#liferay> hum how could i change the height of an aui:input? size is for length, what was the comment for the heights?
11:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> whatsoever_, you should use css instead of tag properties.
11:11 < whatsoever_:#liferay> well i have a way bigger problem.. i included a service layer, but the xxxportlet.java is missing -____-
11:13 < whatsoever_:#liferay> where can i put my java code now ? :(
11:18 < jardineworks:#liferay> whatsoever_, sorry? I'm not sure I understand what you mean
11:18 < whatsoever_:#liferay> i build my service layer, and i normally had a file where i could put my java code -> if the servicelayer is called holiday, the file was holidayportlet.java
11:19 < whatsoever_:#liferay> but this file is missing :(
11:20 < whatsoever_:#liferay> afk for some minutes :/
11:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> the service layer doesn't build portlet class files./
11:22 < jardineworks:#liferay> you would have a HolidayLocalServiceImpl ... HolidayLocalService, HolidayService, HolidayServiceImpl, etc.
11:22 < jardineworks:#liferay> if you created an mvc portlet then the liferay MVCPortlet class is what would be rendering your portlet
11:23 < jardineworks:#liferay> you would need to modify the portlet.xml to specify a new class (and package) to a class that extends the MVCPortlet and then add/override your logic.
11:47 -!- mode/#liferay [+o jhf] by ChanServ
13:25 < whatsoever_:#liferay> jardineworks : localserviceimpl.java? says its for implementation
13:27 < jardineworks:#liferay> whatsoever_, http://www.liferay.com/documentation/liferay-portal/6.0/development/-/ai/service-build-2
13:27 < jardineworks:#liferay> maybe refresh your memory on service builder :)
13:28 < whatsoever_:#liferay> well yeah, as i said, half a year is a long time^^ ill read it
13:29 < whatsoever_:#liferay> BookLocalServiceImpl - local service implementation. This is the only class within the local service that you will be able to modify manually. Your business logic will be here.
15:36 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey jhf  are you around?
15:47 < whatsoever_:#liferay> meh i still dont get it :( on my old versions, i had a addmemberportlet.java that was like this:  public class AddmemberPortlet extends MVCPortlet {   (addmember was the name of the portlet)
15:57 < jardineworks:#liferay> its the same in 6.2 .. but that has nothing to do with service builder.
15:58 < whatsoever_:#liferay> well i start off new now, maybe i missed sth
15:58 < whatsoever_:#liferay> i created a portlet, now i do my jsp
15:59 < whatsoever_:#liferay> now , use default portlet or create new portlet (default => MVCportlet) ?
15:59 < whatsoever_:#liferay> maybe i missed it there^^
16:02 < whatsoever_:#liferay> ok jsp are working, everything seems fine
16:03 < whatsoever_:#liferay> and now i wanna use the service layer to connect my portlet to the database?
16:46 < whatsoever_:#liferay> well i finally found the problem ^_^
16:53 < whatsoever_:#liferay> anyone ever used this ? http://blogs.xtivia.com/home/-/blogs/liferay-alloy-ui-calendar-datepicker-and-datepickerselect
18:33 < whatsoever_:#liferay> value ="<%=holiday.getPrename() is quoted with " which must be escaped when used within the value   anyone remember when to escape the data?
