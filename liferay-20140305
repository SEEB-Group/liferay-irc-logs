02:56 < wench:#liferay> hi guys, I need some help with JAAS configuration with Liferay
02:57 < wench:#liferay> I have a custom login module and I need Liferay to work with IT as well\
02:57 < wench:#liferay> what is the needed steps for that
02:57 < wench:#liferay> appreciate ur help,
06:19 < Jusle:#liferay> Hello! I'd like to have a feature that Liferay opens correct language based on quest user location. For example, if the user comes from Spain, Liferay shows Spanish version, if from Finland, Finnish version etc. How I can have this feature on Liferay? Thanks in advance.
06:24 < Jusle:#liferay> I have tried Google and Liferay.com but can't find answer. I am using Liferay 6.2.
07:10 < Jusle:#liferay> I've posted the question to forum https://www.liferay.com/community/forums/-/message_boards/message/35286343
07:40 < Axxell:#liferay> Hey guys, what does the Control panel ->Portal settings-> Virtual Host do? Im trying to get rid of /web/guest from the url
09:19 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> hi there
09:20 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> some security problem here : we just saw that - anyone - (guest user) can see our directory portlet by just adding ?p_p_id=2&p_p_state=maximized&_2_struts_action=/directory/view to our portal URL. this is a big flaw here. Any quick advice ? We're on Liferay 5.2.3
09:21 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> And btw changing rights of the directory portlets through plugin configuration menu in liferay admin did not change anything (guest still can access this page. We did not reboot the server btw)
09:23 < topolik:#liferay> nicolas_FR: upgrade to 6.2
09:24 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> topolik: thanks for the advice, but I was looking for a quick solution, not something like migrating all our portlets + portal to 6.2
09:28 < topolik:#liferay> https://issues.liferay.com/browse/LPS-8374 - there are patches included
09:39 < nicolas_FR_:#liferay> thanks topolik , got disconnected did not see your last post until I checked logs of the channel
09:41 < topolik:#liferay> y/w
09:45 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Hey guys.
09:45 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Does it affect existing web content when I modify a template?
09:46 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Because right now it feels like my web content is using the old version of a template I've modified several times since the content was created.
10:21 < nicolas_FR_:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur: yes. We have a lot of contents based on templates, and of course when we change the templates, the contents are displayed properly
10:26 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Meaning they use the new template instantly or they stay the way they were when you published them?
