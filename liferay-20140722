09:46 < Yam`:#liferay> hi
10:42 < Yam`:#liferay> I created a "Liferay Portlet"  type "Theme" in Liferay's Developer Studio and just let it create the theme and did nothing with it. I tried then to make a page use this theme in Liferay but it displayed the following error:
10:42 < Yam`:#liferay> javax.servlet.jsp.JspException: com.liferay.portal.kernel.template.TemplateException: Unable to process template Red-theme_SERVLET_CONTEXT_/templates/portal_normal.ftl
10:42 < Yam`:#liferay> Have I missed something?
10:44 < jardineworks:#liferay> Yam`, you mean you created a Liferay PLUGIN that is a theme type ... so you made a Liferay Theme Plugin right?
10:44 < Yam`:#liferay> that must be it jardineworks
10:44 < jardineworks:#liferay> Yam`, and di dyou do it through the UI?
10:45 < jardineworks:#liferay> meaning eclipse IDE
10:45 < jardineworks:#liferay> oh you did
10:45 < jardineworks:#liferay> you said that
10:45 < Yam`:#liferay> yes I did haha
10:45 < jardineworks:#liferay> is there a reason you chose FTL? or just because that was the default?
10:46 < Yam`:#liferay> It must be the default because I don't see it anywhere when I try to create another liferay theme plugin
10:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> Yam`, ok, do you mind doing it again with me?
10:46 < Yam`:#liferay> (I don't even know what this is)
10:46 < Yam`:#liferay> not at all
10:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> ftl is the extension for freemaker ... which is a templating language.
10:47 < Yam`:#liferay> ok
10:47 < jardineworks:#liferay> the other option that I think is typically more commonly used is velocity (.vm)
10:47 < jardineworks:#liferay> right click on the current project and delete it ... make sure you check the box to remove all the files as well. (that way you can use the same name)
10:48 < Yam`:#liferay> ok it's done
10:48 < Yam`:#liferay> I've got an error while deleting
10:48 < jardineworks:#liferay> what was the error?
10:49 < Yam`:#liferay> "An exception has been caught while processing the refactoring 'Delete Resource'
10:49 < Yam`:#liferay> Reason:
10:49 < Yam`:#liferay> Problems encountered while deleting resources."
10:50 < jardineworks:#liferay> check on the disk and make sure it is gone.
10:50 < jardineworks:#liferay> if not then rm -rf it
10:51 < Yam`:#liferay> (I'm on windows now :()
10:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> also make sure that it is not in the TOMCAT_HOME/webapps directory
10:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> ok.. right click delete :)
10:51 < Yam`:#liferay> nope it's in liferay-plugins-sdk-6.2/themes
10:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> do a rmdir /s on it
10:52 < Yam`:#liferay> thank's I could not delete it with the GUI even after stopping the liferay servr
10:52 < Yam`:#liferay> +e
10:52 < jardineworks:#liferay> probably permissions... you need to open those windows "As an Administrator" I bet
10:53 < jardineworks:#liferay> anyway... all gone now?
10:53 < jardineworks:#liferay> including from the webapps?
