09:46 < Yam`:#liferay> hi
10:42 < Yam`:#liferay> I created a "Liferay Portlet"  type "Theme" in Liferay's Developer Studio and just let it create the theme and did nothing with it. I tried then to make a page use this theme in Liferay but it displayed the following error:
10:42 < Yam`:#liferay> javax.servlet.jsp.JspException: com.liferay.portal.kernel.template.TemplateException: Unable to process template Red-theme_SERVLET_CONTEXT_/templates/portal_normal.ftl
10:42 < Yam`:#liferay> Have I missed something?
10:44 < jardineworks:#liferay> Yam`, you mean you created a Liferay PLUGIN that is a theme type ... so you made a Liferay Theme Plugin right?
10:44 < Yam`:#liferay> that must be it jardineworks
10:44 < jardineworks:#liferay> Yam`, and di dyou do it through the UI?
10:45 < jardineworks:#liferay> meaning eclipse IDE
10:45 < jardineworks:#liferay> oh you did
10:45 < jardineworks:#liferay> you said that
10:45 < Yam`:#liferay> yes I did haha
10:45 < jardineworks:#liferay> is there a reason you chose FTL? or just because that was the default?
10:46 < Yam`:#liferay> It must be the default because I don't see it anywhere when I try to create another liferay theme plugin
10:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> Yam`, ok, do you mind doing it again with me?
10:46 < Yam`:#liferay> (I don't even know what this is)
10:46 < Yam`:#liferay> not at all
10:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> ftl is the extension for freemaker ... which is a templating language.
10:47 < Yam`:#liferay> ok
