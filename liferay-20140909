03:59 < soka_:#liferay> Axxell: I didn't catch ur questoin I just joined, could u repost I'll help if I can
04:24 < Axxell:#liferay> soka_: yeah, ive done a vaadin portlets which uses service builder and scheduler event listener to import som user data from AD and store it localy for speedier delivery. I want that data to be searchable by the system search engine. Ive extended the baseindexer class to make my own indexer. Ive checked that the data is in lucene with luke, but i dont know how to configure the search portlet to search my data
04:25 < Axxell:#liferay> one thing is in my indexer av added keywords, and i suspect i might need to add fields?
04:46 < Axxell:#liferay> i also do not know which fields are required for the whole thing to work
07:09 < jardineworks_:#liferay> Axxell, jus tto be clear... you are using the "search" portlet not the "web content search" portlet right?
07:09 < goku_:#liferay> hi, how to getting current page name in portlet.vm template file ?
07:10 < jardineworks_:#liferay> goku_, I think there is a layout variable available ...
07:10 < jardineworks_:#liferay> so $layout.title maybe?
07:11 < goku_:#liferay> jardinworks_, oh ok.
07:11 < jardineworks_:#liferay> goku_,
07:11 < jardineworks_:#liferay> sorry... looking at the LayoutImpl class...
07:11 < jardineworks_:#liferay> might be $layout.HTMLTitle( $locale )
07:12 < jardineworks_:#liferay> $layout.getHTMLTitle( $locale )
07:13 < goku_:#liferay> jardinworks_,this will give me the portlet title right?
07:13 < goku_:#liferay> or page?
07:13 < jardineworks_:#liferay> goku_, acutally looking at the init.vm I can see this line --
07:13 < jardineworks_:#liferay> #set ($the_title = $languageUtil.get($locale, $the_title, $page.getName($locale)))
07:13 < jardineworks_:#liferay> that would be the page title.
07:13 < jardineworks_:#liferay> page and layout are synonymous
07:14 < goku_:#liferay> jardineworks_,thanks
07:15 < jardineworks_:#liferay> goku_, or ... :)
07:15 < jardineworks_:#liferay> #if ($pageTitle)
07:15 < jardineworks_:#liferay> 	#set ($the_title = $pageTitle)
07:15 < jardineworks_:#liferay> #end
07:15 < jardineworks_:#liferay> so $pageTitle wins!
07:16 < jardineworks_:#liferay> Axxell, if you are using the "Search" portlet which is the same as a federated search then the easiest way it to enable open search as part of the search portlet configuration and then add some configuration to the liferay-portlet.xml.
07:21 < goku_:#liferay> jardineworks, ok finaly $the_title helped me :)
07:30 < jardineworks_:#liferay> goku_, \o/
07:30 < jardineworks_:#liferay> :)
07:43 < Axxell:#liferay> jardineworks_: exactly what do i need to do?
