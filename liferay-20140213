01:31 < rocknroll_:#liferay> hey all
01:32 < rocknroll_:#liferay> I have a set of pages (layouts) with a web content display portlet on it
01:33 < rocknroll_:#liferay> how do I add an article to this portlet via jsonws?
07:37 < noctua_:#liferay> hi, I am trying to use JFreeChart for a Liferay Portlet. The problem is, that i can't see the Image. for example, i used the code from http://tinyurl.com/kjjoomc
07:38 < noctua_:#liferay> hope someone can help me
08:23 < rocknroll_:#liferay> noctua_ what does your server log say
08:28 < noctua_:#liferay> rocknroll_: nothing special ... it just donsn't show the picture
08:29 < noctua_:#liferay> or you mean when i deploy it?
08:30 < noctua_:#liferay> instead it shows a "not found" picture
08:30 < rocknroll_:#liferay> well your problem description is a little lacking :)
08:31 < rocknroll_:#liferay> I was thinking that your server log might have more information about it
08:36 < noctua_:#liferay> yeah ... i know that it
08:36 < noctua_:#liferay> that it's lacking ^^
08:36 < noctua_:#liferay> but i have no idea where i could start for debugging xD
08:37 < rocknroll_:#liferay> is there nothing in your log then?
08:38 < noctua_:#liferay> no ... if i put the portlet on the page then there is no console outpu xD
08:39 < noctua_:#liferay> if i put another portlet, which is "brocken" than there is an output
08:41 < noctua_:#liferay> i can give you the log when i deploy it. If you want
08:42 < noctua_:#liferay> http://pastebin.com/eF29bjBm
08:43 < rocknroll_:#liferay> and when you try to view the image, there is nothing in the log? just a 404?
08:43 < rocknroll_:#liferay> or is the image there but it's broken?
08:44 < rocknroll_:#liferay> I dont know this JFreeChart, so just guessing
08:56 < noctua_:#liferay> Yes .. there is no Image .... but ecplise show's me that there hase to be one by showing me the "here should be an image" image
08:57 < noctua_:#liferay> i mean ... if i looc at the code than there is only an <img src> tag
08:58 < noctua_:#liferay> without content
08:58 < rocknroll_:#liferay> so the src="" is empty?
08:58 < noctua_:#liferay> yes
09:13 < rocknroll_:#liferay> well, i like a good mystery :) but debugging is hard without the code
09:16 < noctua_:#liferay> I coppied the code 1:1 from http://learnliferay.wikidot.com/resource-serving-example
09:17 < noctua_:#liferay> i think it's hard to debugg even with the code ^^

11:43 < barrie:#liferay> Anyone know if there is a way to use resources-importer from a portlet or hook? I'm looking to import web content into existing sites.
12:48 < AhmadElMelegy:#liferay> Can I add separate message board into every community ?
12:53 < barrie:#liferay> Each community (site) can have it's own Message Board, Wiki, etc.. and it's data is stored separately
12:59 < AhmadElMelegy:#liferay> thanks :)
13:41 < AhmadElMelegy:#liferay> Every time I save changes in User Ranks in Message boards it returns to default automatically !

13:59 <@jhf:#liferay> hey rotty3000
14:12 < AhmadElMelegy:#liferay> Every time I save changes in User Ranks in Message boards it returns to default automatically !
14:16 < AhmadElMelegy:#liferay> not only User Ranks I discovered that all message board configurations are not saved !1
15:01 < AhmadElMelegy:#liferay> anyone can help me ?
15:01 < AhmadElMelegy:#liferay> configurations of message board are not saved
15:02 < AhmadElMelegy:#liferay> every time I change them they restored to default automatically !
16:07 <@jhf:#liferay> AhmadElMelegy: what version of Liferay are you using?
16:07 < AhmadElMelegy:#liferay> CE 6.2
16:07 <@jhf:#liferay> and was it a fresh install, or upgrade? and have you made any configuration changes? or should I be able to reproduce this by installing a fresh 6.2 ?
16:09 <@jhf:#liferay> well I just tried it anyway, and it worked for me (changed the "User Ranks" configuration)
16:09 <@jhf:#liferay> soo... any errors in your log file?
16:09 <@jhf:#liferay> also, what database are you using?
16:25 < AhmadElMelegy:#liferay> fresh install it's on my local host just for try
16:26 < AhmadElMelegy:#liferay> I did not configure any thing for database
16:41 < AhmadElMelegy:#liferay> jhf:
17:00 < AhmadElMelegy:#liferay> I am using the default hsql
17:00 < AhmadElMelegy:#liferay> is this the problem ?
17:00 < AhmadElMelegy:#liferay> jhf:
17:13 <@jhf:#liferay> nope.. so am I.
17:14 <@jhf:#liferay> can you look in your log file and see if there are obvious stack trace/errors ?
17:14 <@jhf:#liferay> it's in tomcat-xx.xx.xx/logs/catalina.out
17:24 < AhmadElMelegy:#liferay> this is catalina.out : http://pastebin.com/3QihJ9iz
17:24 < AhmadElMelegy:#liferay> jhf:
17:31 <@jhf:#liferay> hmm well it looks like in the past you may have started multiple liferays (I see errors about "address already in use (8080)" and some lucene errors because it was probably trying to write to the same location as another process. but the last bit of your log file looks relatively clean, other than the fact that you tried to deploy a plugin from an old version of Liferay (version 5.2.3??) and that clearly failed, but I see nothing specific to configuration of
17:31 <@jhf:#liferay> message boards
17:32 <@jhf:#liferay> I would recommend you start over, wipe everything out, re-unzip the fresh distribution, and try again, and see if you can get a "clean" log file and startup.
17:34 < AhmadElMelegy:#liferay> ok I'll try then come back, thanks :)
17:35 <@jhf:#liferay> ok. sorry you've having trouble, but I think it's some kind of corruption somewhere possibly caused by those earlier errors about running multiple Liferay's.
17:35 <@jhf:#liferay> still though, if that's all it takes to make it fail, then that's not good.
17:37 < AhmadElMelegy:#liferay> I tried to run liferay in eclipse and it was already run in the browser
17:37 < AhmadElMelegy:#liferay> then the error of running multiple Liferay's appears
17:38 <@jhf:#liferay> ok. I am wondering if that caused some kind of corruption.
17:38 <@jhf:#liferay> causing the message boards error. unlikely, but you never know. hsql isn't exactly "enterprise-grade" :)
18:04 < AhmadElMelegy:#liferay> jhf: it works, thank you :)
18:04 <@jhf:#liferay> great!
