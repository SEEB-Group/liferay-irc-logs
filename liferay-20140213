01:31 < rocknroll_:#liferay> hey all
01:32 < rocknroll_:#liferay> I have a set of pages (layouts) with a web content display portlet on it
01:33 < rocknroll_:#liferay> how do I add an article to this portlet via jsonws?
07:37 < noctua_:#liferay> hi, I am trying to use JFreeChart for a Liferay Portlet. The problem is, that i can't see the Image. for example, i used the code from http://tinyurl.com/kjjoomc
07:38 < noctua_:#liferay> hope someone can help me
08:23 < rocknroll_:#liferay> noctua_ what does your server log say
08:28 < noctua_:#liferay> rocknroll_: nothing special ... it just donsn't show the picture
08:29 < noctua_:#liferay> or you mean when i deploy it?
08:30 < noctua_:#liferay> instead it shows a "not found" picture
08:30 < rocknroll_:#liferay> well your problem description is a little lacking :)
08:31 < rocknroll_:#liferay> I was thinking that your server log might have more information about it
08:36 < noctua_:#liferay> yeah ... i know that it
08:36 < noctua_:#liferay> that it's lacking ^^
08:36 < noctua_:#liferay> but i have no idea where i could start for debugging xD
08:37 < rocknroll_:#liferay> is there nothing in your log then?
08:38 < noctua_:#liferay> no ... if i put the portlet on the page then there is no console outpu xD
08:39 < noctua_:#liferay> if i put another portlet, which is "brocken" than there is an output
08:41 < noctua_:#liferay> i can give you the log when i deploy it. If you want
08:42 < noctua_:#liferay> http://pastebin.com/eF29bjBm
08:43 < rocknroll_:#liferay> and when you try to view the image, there is nothing in the log? just a 404?
08:43 < rocknroll_:#liferay> or is the image there but it's broken?
08:44 < rocknroll_:#liferay> I dont know this JFreeChart, so just guessing
08:56 < noctua_:#liferay> Yes .. there is no Image .... but ecplise show's me that there hase to be one by showing me the "here should be an image" image
08:57 < noctua_:#liferay> i mean ... if i looc at the code than there is only an <img src> tag
08:58 < noctua_:#liferay> without content
