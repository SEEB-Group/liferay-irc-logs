01:31 < rocknroll_:#liferay> hey all
01:32 < rocknroll_:#liferay> I have a set of pages (layouts) with a web content display portlet on it
01:33 < rocknroll_:#liferay> how do I add an article to this portlet via jsonws?
07:37 < noctua_:#liferay> hi, I am trying to use JFreeChart for a Liferay Portlet. The problem is, that i can't see the Image. for example, i used the code from http://tinyurl.com/kjjoomc
07:38 < noctua_:#liferay> hope someone can help me
08:23 < rocknroll_:#liferay> noctua_ what does your server log say
08:28 < noctua_:#liferay> rocknroll_: nothing special ... it just donsn't show the picture
08:29 < noctua_:#liferay> or you mean when i deploy it?
08:30 < noctua_:#liferay> instead it shows a "not found" picture
08:30 < rocknroll_:#liferay> well your problem description is a little lacking :)
08:31 < rocknroll_:#liferay> I was thinking that your server log might have more information about it
08:36 < noctua_:#liferay> yeah ... i know that it
08:36 < noctua_:#liferay> that it's lacking ^^
08:36 < noctua_:#liferay> but i have no idea where i could start for debugging xD
08:37 < rocknroll_:#liferay> is there nothing in your log then?
08:38 < noctua_:#liferay> no ... if i put the portlet on the page then there is no console outpu xD
