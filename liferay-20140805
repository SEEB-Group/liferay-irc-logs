10:11 < Yam`:#liferay> hi
10:14 < bijoo_:#liferay> Yam`: hello; how's it going here for you?
10:17 < Yam`:#liferay> bijoo_, i'm trying to do things with MVCPortlet but I'm a beginner and I don't find example of what I wanna do
10:17 < jardineworks:#liferay> Yam`, what are you trying to do?
10:18 < Yam`:#liferay> I have an organization let's say IBM
10:19 < Yam`:#liferay> with two sub organizations: Calyon and Amundi
10:19 < Yam`:#liferay> I want to test if I can do a portlet that displays the users in the same organization of the viewer
10:20 < Yam`:#liferay> ex: if johndoe in Calyon opens the page where there's the portlet, it displays the users of Calyon
10:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> Yam`, you shoul dbe able to do that with the OrganizationLocalServiceUtil.
10:22 < jardineworks:#liferay> Yam`, OrganizationLocalServiceUtil.getUserOrganizations( [userid], Boolean.TRUE ); might do it ...
10:23 < Yam`:#liferay> I'll try that jardineworks thanks :)
10:24 < jardineworks:#liferay> you can get the current users user id by using the PortalUtil.getUserId( renderRequest ); (assuming that you are doing this in the render method)
10:24 < jardineworks:#liferay> oh no wait
10:24 < jardineworks:#liferay> that will give you the list of organizations that user is in...
10:25 < jardineworks:#liferay> Yam`, UserLocalServiceUtil.getOrganizationUsers( organizationId );
10:25 < Yam`:#liferay> where do you see the methods?
10:26 < Yam`:#liferay> because if I learn how to do it I might have less problems :D
10:26 < jardineworks:#liferay> that will give you a List<User> that you can add to the renderRequest.setAttribute ... and then in the JSP you can use JSTL to <c:forEach /> over the users.
