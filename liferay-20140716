10:40 < Yam`:#liferay> hi
10:44 < ArTeS:#liferay> HÄ°.
10:44 < ArTeS:#liferay> hi*
11:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey guys
11:10 < Yam`:#liferay> how are you doing jardineworks?
11:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> Yam`, good -- freakin' busy as all get out but better busy than bored.
11:11 < Yam`:#liferay> for sure!
11:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> Yam`, did you manage to get your portlet/theme working?
11:24 < Yam`:#liferay> I'm on something else for the moment jardineworks
11:33 < bijoo:#liferay> jardineworks: saw your question from two days back on logs:
11:34 < bijoo:#liferay> "bijoo_, do you use ANT of Maven for your plugins?"
11:34 < bijoo:#liferay> So I try to use maven when I can; and when have lots of dependencies there.
11:34 < bijoo:#liferay> jardineworks: on new project, I would encourage it; especially, if it'll be a large one.
11:35 < bijoo:#liferay> jardineworks: I like the POM structure and dep manage.
11:36 < bijoo:#liferay> jardineworks: ANT is totally fine; but sometimes tough. I like Maven repos to manage jars.
11:39 < bijoo:#liferay> goku_ not sure what you mean there, please repeat it. "hi, how to auto update timestamps to db while adding ?" ref: http://liferay.seebgroup.com/irc/liferay-20140711      ; you may be referring to audit fields; e.g. set date no the model when passed?
11:40 < bijoo:#liferay> goku_ second question's really on Hibernate; may want to check those docs or that channel. "goku_:#liferay> hi ,how to create a RestrictionFactoryUtil to check between two date ?" ref:http://liferay.seebgroup.com/irc/liferay-20140714    ; I'd tell you but don't know on top of head.
11:42 < bijoo:#liferay> goku last qusetion's answered by Google here: http://t.seebgroup.com/custom-fields-velocity-template-link
11:42 < bijoo:#liferay> "how to access user custom fields from liferay theme velocity template ?" ref: http://liferay.seebgroup.com/irc/liferay-20140715
11:48 < Yam`:#liferay> jardineworks, you told me to edit "icon-plus, icon-desktop, icon-edit" to change the colors of all the blue things of Liferay (buttons, toolbars etc.) but I don't find those files, where are they?
11:48 < jardineworks:#liferay> does anyone know if it is possible to view LEP issues on issues.liferay.com?
11:49 < jardineworks:#liferay> Yam`, those aren't the files, those are the css classes
