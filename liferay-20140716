04:59 < Yam``:#liferay> hi
10:40 < Yam`:#liferay> hi
10:44 < ArTeS:#liferay> Hİ.
10:44 < ArTeS:#liferay> hi*
11:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey guys
11:10 < Yam`:#liferay> how are you doing jardineworks?
11:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> Yam`, good -- freakin' busy as all get out but better busy than bored.
11:11 < Yam`:#liferay> for sure!
11:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> Yam`, did you manage to get your portlet/theme working?
11:24 < Yam`:#liferay> I'm on something else for the moment jardineworks
11:33 < bijoo:#liferay> jardineworks: saw your question from two days back on logs:
11:34 < bijoo:#liferay> "bijoo_, do you use ANT of Maven for your plugins?"
11:34 < bijoo:#liferay> So I try to use maven when I can; and when have lots of dependencies there.
11:34 < bijoo:#liferay> jardineworks: on new project, I would encourage it; especially, if it'll be a large one.
11:35 < bijoo:#liferay> jardineworks: I like the POM structure and dep manage.
11:36 < bijoo:#liferay> jardineworks: ANT is totally fine; but sometimes tough. I like Maven repos to manage jars.
11:39 < bijoo:#liferay> goku_ not sure what you mean there, please repeat it. "hi, how to auto update timestamps to db while adding ?" ref: http://liferay.seebgroup.com/irc/liferay-20140711      ; you may be referring to audit fields; e.g. set date no the model when passed?
11:40 < bijoo:#liferay> goku_ second question's really on Hibernate; may want to check those docs or that channel. "goku_:#liferay> hi ,how to create a RestrictionFactoryUtil to check between two date ?" ref:http://liferay.seebgroup.com/irc/liferay-20140714    ; I'd tell you but don't know on top of head.
11:42 < bijoo:#liferay> goku last qusetion's answered by Google here: http://t.seebgroup.com/custom-fields-velocity-template-link
11:42 < bijoo:#liferay> "how to access user custom fields from liferay theme velocity template ?" ref: http://liferay.seebgroup.com/irc/liferay-20140715
11:48 < Yam`:#liferay> jardineworks, you told me to edit "icon-plus, icon-desktop, icon-edit" to change the colors of all the blue things of Liferay (buttons, toolbars etc.) but I don't find those files, where are they?
11:48 < jardineworks:#liferay> does anyone know if it is possible to view LEP issues on issues.liferay.com?
11:49 < jardineworks:#liferay> Yam`, those aren't the files, those are the css classes
11:49 < Yam`:#liferay> oh, ok
11:51 < Yam`:#liferay> and do you know where the colors are defined?
11:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> Yam`, if you use Inspector (chrome) or Firebug (firefox) you should be able to inspect the elements and see what CSS styles are defined.
11:52 < Yam`:#liferay> yes I've done that but if I could edit the files I think it may be cleaner than just adding custom css, no?
11:52 < jardineworks:#liferay> nope
11:53 < jardineworks:#liferay> the proper way to do it is to override the styles in a custom.css ... and load that file last in the theme
11:53 < Yam`:#liferay> how do I load it in the theme? (or where)
11:54 < jardineworks:#liferay> when you create a theme you will create a _dffs folder and in there a css folder. In there you add custom.css. The main.css does a buck of the css imports ... so all you do is import all the other styles first and add the custom.css last.
11:55 < Yam`:#liferay> Ok, and to create a theme?
11:55 < jardineworks:#liferay> New > Project > Liferay-Plugin Project ... choose theme from the options.
11:56 < Yam`:#liferay> ok, ty :)
11:56 < Yam`:#liferay> I've never asked you but you are a liferay developper or you just use it?
11:57 < jardineworks:#liferay> its how I earn 1/2 my living
11:57 < jardineworks:#liferay> YOu mean, do I work for Liferay?
11:57 -!- mode/#liferay [+o rotty3000] by ChanServ
11:57 < Yam`:#liferay> Yes
11:58 < jardineworks:#liferay> I don't work for Liferay. I have my own company (just me) and I do consulting for clients that use Liferay. Sometimes just subject matter expertise, other times I do full builds
11:59 < Yam`:#liferay> How did you come up with this?
12:00 < jardineworks:#liferay> I used to work for a company that OEM'ed Liferay as part of their product offering. I did a couple of projects that requried a lot fo work customizing Liferay and fell in love. So I started my own practice.
12:00 < Yam`:#liferay> that's nice of you to take from your time to help people here
12:00 < Yam`:#liferay> ok, nice :)
12:00 < jardineworks:#liferay> Liferay is an awesome product and helps me earn a living... so I like to give back and help people use the product so that they can develop the same passion I have
12:01 < Yam`:#liferay> that's pretty neat yes
12:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> plus, the Liferay guys ... the actual Liferay guys have helped me plenty, so I think its only fair I try to help them out as well./
12:01 < Yam`:#liferay> :D
12:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> that's the mantra for open source and the community based development after all right :)
12:02 < Yam`:#liferay> I know, I like to help others as well but it's always nice to be thanked :)
12:02 < jardineworks:#liferay> true :)
12:03 < Yam`:#liferay> and what do you do for your other half?
12:03 < jardineworks:#liferay> Endeca -- or now it is called Oracle Endeca. I am also working on Mongo and Elastic Search .. but still not expert enough to sell that.
12:05 < Yam`:#liferay> You do consulting for these technos too that's it?
12:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> yep
12:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> but right now mostly LR
12:05 < Yam`:#liferay> ok :)
12:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> been a while since I did an Endeca gig to be honest.
12:06 < Yam`:#liferay> I don't even know what this is
12:06 < jardineworks:#liferay> Agile business intelligence, data mining, etc.
12:06 < Yam`:#liferay> mokay
12:11 < Yam`:#liferay> I'm going back home, have a nice day jardineworks :)
12:13 < jardineworks:#liferay> thanks .. bon soire!
12:17 < Yam`:#liferay> that would be "bonne soirée" or "bonsoir" but thank you :D
12:18 < Yam`:#liferay> (rather "bonne soirée" in this situation fyi)
12:18 < Yam`:#liferay> bye!
12:46 < sl33k:#liferay> hi guys
12:46 < sl33k:#liferay> pls need help on stack trace
13:28 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey rotty3000 do you have a minute for a question?
13:29 < sl33k:#liferay> i am having problems with displaytag url
13:32 < sl33k:#liferay> i am having a problem similar to this; http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3601214/get-displaytag-to-use-an-action-url-for-page-switching
13:33 < jardineworks:#liferay> sl33k, why would you using an action url to switch pages instead of a render url?
13:35 < jardineworks:#liferay> sl33k, I think you want to use a renderURL and pass the jspPage as a param
13:35 < jardineworks:#liferay> sl33k, that will invoke the render phase and load the page you specify in the jspPage param instead of the default view.jsp
13:36 < sl33k:#liferay> jardineworks: see error bin
13:37 < sl33k:#liferay> http://pastebin.com/t9681LfQ
13:37 < jardineworks:#liferay> sl33k, also, changing pages of data is not really an action... its changing the view, so that logic should actually be in the render logic.
13:37 < sl33k:#liferay> jardineworks: please :(
13:38 < sl33k:#liferay> yeah but the way my app is mapped up, i cant have two controllers mapping to render or so
13:38 < jardineworks:#liferay> sl33k, is this a SpringMVC portlet
13:38 < jardineworks:#liferay> ?
13:38 < sl33k:#liferay> yes
13:38 < jardineworks:#liferay> shoot -- i don't know anything about them. I always opt for the Liferay MVC portlets.
13:38 < jardineworks:#liferay> do you have to have two controllers?
13:39 < jardineworks:#liferay> shouldn;t a single portlet have a single controller?
15:27 -!- mode/#liferay [+o jhf] by ChanServ
15:42 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, are you around enough to chat about a couple of things?
15:43  * jhf:#liferay checks CFP submission queue
15:43 < jardineworks:#liferay> LOL
15:43 < jardineworks:#liferay> c'mon!
15:43 < jardineworks:#liferay> I'm scared :)
15:44 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah I’m around for the next 15-20 mins… what can I do for ya :)
15:44 < jardineworks:#liferay> i18n
15:44 < jardineworks:#liferay> I see two properties...
15:44 < jardineworks:#liferay> if I sue this --
15:44 < jardineworks:#liferay> locale.prepend.friendly.url.style=0
15:44 < jardineworks:#liferay> locale.default.request=true
15:45 < jardineworks:#liferay> then it should never put the language in the url, and for guest users take whatever is set for the local in the request header
15:45 < jardineworks:#liferay> at least that is what I understand....
15:45 < jardineworks:#liferay> is it possible to have a logged in user use the request header instead of the users preferred language?
15:46 <@jhf:#liferay> dunno but I can look around in the code for a few mins
15:47 < jardineworks:#liferay> I'll send an email about sprouts right now...
15:48 < jardineworks:#liferay> see if the legal has been worked out
15:49 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, the fact that you can only have one domain per site/instance is a real pain in the ass.
15:49 < jardineworks:#liferay> These bilingual types need support for multiple.
15:50 <@jhf:#liferay> no way around the preferredlanguage (other than to prevent users from setting it!)
15:50 <@jhf:#liferay> looking at https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/blob/6.2.x/portal-impl/src/com/liferay/portal/servlet/filters/i18n/I18nFilter.java
15:52 <@jhf:#liferay> line 191 sets the locale from the user’s preferred language
15:52 <@jhf:#liferay> I see no ‘if/else’ or a way to override
15:53 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, so I would have to modify the i18nFilter and override that... boo
15:54 <@jhf:#liferay> can you prevent users from setting a preferred language?
15:54 <@jhf:#liferay> e.g. via some kind of jsp override?
15:54 < jardineworks:#liferay> but then won't it just pick up the company default?
15:54 <@jhf:#liferay> I mean if you want to ignore the user’s wishes..
15:54 <@jhf:#liferay> hmm.. yeah yer right
15:54 <@jhf:#liferay> you’d need to override the filter
15:54 < jardineworks:#liferay> and actually
15:55 < jardineworks:#liferay> that is just for the prepend  method... but I set the property such that no prepend occurs.
15:58 < jardineworks:#liferay> awww!
15:59 <@jhf:#liferay> oh check ths out
15:59 <@jhf:#liferay> https://www.liferay.com/community/forums/-/message_boards/message/9237414
15:59 < jardineworks:#liferay> if only the style logic was checked first and then if style 2 or 3 was chosen THEN check for a user
15:59 <@jhf:#liferay> Tejas wrote a hook to do it
15:59 <@jhf:#liferay> https://github.com/opensourceforlife/browser-language-hook
16:00 <@jhf:#liferay> it’s a post-login hook action
16:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> awesome
16:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> I think that might be the solution I need... just need to make sure that it still works on 6.2 EE
16:17 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, hmm... but what is I am in english... I log in, my preferred language is set to English. Then I change my BROWSER language to French. Then my browser will be in French but my profile won't have been updated.
16:18 <@jhf:#liferay> I think at that point you’d have to log out of Liferay and back in cause that hook would need to run again to reset your preferred language
16:18 < jardineworks:#liferay> hmm
16:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, or introduce another hook... a service pre that would keep it all in synch
16:21 <@jhf:#liferay> you could put some code in a service pre action instead of a login post action to do the browser language check every time
16:21 <@jhf:#liferay> yup
16:21 <@jhf:#liferay> :)
16:22 <@jhf:#liferay> wouldn’t have much performance impact, unless your site is REALLY heavily traffic'd
16:22 <@jhf:#liferay> (no, that’s not proper english :) )
