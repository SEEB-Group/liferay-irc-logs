04:59 < Yam``:#liferay> hi
10:40 < Yam`:#liferay> hi
10:44 < ArTeS:#liferay> HÄ°.
10:44 < ArTeS:#liferay> hi*
11:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey guys
11:10 < Yam`:#liferay> how are you doing jardineworks?
11:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> Yam`, good -- freakin' busy as all get out but better busy than bored.
11:11 < Yam`:#liferay> for sure!
11:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> Yam`, did you manage to get your portlet/theme working?
11:24 < Yam`:#liferay> I'm on something else for the moment jardineworks
11:33 < bijoo:#liferay> jardineworks: saw your question from two days back on logs:
11:34 < bijoo:#liferay> "bijoo_, do you use ANT of Maven for your plugins?"
11:34 < bijoo:#liferay> So I try to use maven when I can; and when have lots of dependencies there.
11:34 < bijoo:#liferay> jardineworks: on new project, I would encourage it; especially, if it'll be a large one.
11:35 < bijoo:#liferay> jardineworks: I like the POM structure and dep manage.
11:36 < bijoo:#liferay> jardineworks: ANT is totally fine; but sometimes tough. I like Maven repos to manage jars.
11:39 < bijoo:#liferay> goku_ not sure what you mean there, please repeat it. "hi, how to auto update timestamps to db while adding ?" ref: http://liferay.seebgroup.com/irc/liferay-20140711      ; you may be referring to audit fields; e.g. set date no the model when passed?
11:40 < bijoo:#liferay> goku_ second question's really on Hibernate; may want to check those docs or that channel. "goku_:#liferay> hi ,how to create a RestrictionFactoryUtil to check between two date ?" ref:http://liferay.seebgroup.com/irc/liferay-20140714    ; I'd tell you but don't know on top of head.
11:42 < bijoo:#liferay> goku last qusetion's answered by Google here: http://t.seebgroup.com/custom-fields-velocity-template-link
11:42 < bijoo:#liferay> "how to access user custom fields from liferay theme velocity template ?" ref: http://liferay.seebgroup.com/irc/liferay-20140715
11:48 < Yam`:#liferay> jardineworks, you told me to edit "icon-plus, icon-desktop, icon-edit" to change the colors of all the blue things of Liferay (buttons, toolbars etc.) but I don't find those files, where are they?
11:48 < jardineworks:#liferay> does anyone know if it is possible to view LEP issues on issues.liferay.com?
11:49 < jardineworks:#liferay> Yam`, those aren't the files, those are the css classes
11:49 < Yam`:#liferay> oh, ok
11:51 < Yam`:#liferay> and do you know where the colors are defined?
11:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> Yam`, if you use Inspector (chrome) or Firebug (firefox) you should be able to inspect the elements and see what CSS styles are defined.
11:52 < Yam`:#liferay> yes I've done that but if I could edit the files I think it may be cleaner than just adding custom css, no?
11:52 < jardineworks:#liferay> nope
11:53 < jardineworks:#liferay> the proper way to do it is to override the styles in a custom.css ... and load that file last in the theme
11:53 < Yam`:#liferay> how do I load it in the theme? (or where)
11:54 < jardineworks:#liferay> when you create a theme you will create a _dffs folder and in there a css folder. In there you add custom.css. The main.css does a buck of the css imports ... so all you do is import all the other styles first and add the custom.css last.
11:55 < Yam`:#liferay> Ok, and to create a theme?
11:55 < jardineworks:#liferay> New > Project > Liferay-Plugin Project ... choose theme from the options.
11:56 < Yam`:#liferay> ok, ty :)
11:56 < Yam`:#liferay> I've never asked you but you are a liferay developper or you just use it?
11:57 < jardineworks:#liferay> its how I earn 1/2 my living
11:57 < jardineworks:#liferay> YOu mean, do I work for Liferay?
11:57 -!- mode/#liferay [+o rotty3000] by ChanServ
11:57 < Yam`:#liferay> Yes
11:58 < jardineworks:#liferay> I don't work for Liferay. I have my own company (just me) and I do consulting for clients that use Liferay. Sometimes just subject matter expertise, other times I do full builds
11:59 < Yam`:#liferay> How did you come up with this?
12:00 < jardineworks:#liferay> I used to work for a company that OEM'ed Liferay as part of their product offering. I did a couple of projects that requried a lot fo work customizing Liferay and fell in love. So I started my own practice.
12:00 < Yam`:#liferay> that's nice of you to take from your time to help people here
