05:05 < Axxell:#liferay> Hey guys im trying to find out what you can use for sorting in  assetEntryQuery.setOrderByCol1, what i want to use are some of the fields i have in my structure
05:20 < Axxell:#liferay> anyone?
05:54 < wench:#liferay> Axxell try the forums, this channel is not active most of the time
05:55 < Axxell:#liferay> wench: been trying to find any info from before, the forums dont seem much better with getting answers from... usually no answers and if any answers come its more weeks than days
05:55 < wench:#liferay> unfortunately, I help you cause I don't have any information regarding assetEntry
05:56 < wench:#liferay> I'll try to search the guide, and I'll send you any information I can get
05:56 < wench:#liferay> yes that how is always works, unless you have a license
05:57 < wench:#liferay> but it is better than nothing
