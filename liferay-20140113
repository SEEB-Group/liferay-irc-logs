02:55 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> has anyone successfully merged navbar with dockbar (or, vice-versa)?
04:17 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Good morning.
04:17 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Wow...macro names in velocity templates have to be unique?
04:52 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> hmm, odd, I just found about this macros :-)
04:55 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, do you know how to include a macro into the portlet theme?
04:55 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> A macro is nothing but a subroutine inside a velocity template.
04:55 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> You can define them in there and use them.
04:56 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> It's something that only happens in the template. The portlet doesn't even know about it.
04:56 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> (If your portlet even uses velocity templates.)
04:56 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> ok, I was looking a way to combine the docbar and nav bar
04:57 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, actually I was creating a theme. ;-)
04:57 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> So theme, not portlet.
04:57 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> yup
04:57 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> bootstrap one
04:57 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> You can use macros in the velocity templates of your theme as well.
04:57 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I'm not too sure about the details, though.
04:57 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> hmm, thx
04:57 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Never built a theme myself...had to work with the crappy one we've got.
04:58 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> LOL
04:58 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> I am the designer, developer and sadly the admin here. so no way out of that :-D
04:58 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I wish I were!
04:59 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I inherited a totally f***** up Liferay setup.
04:59 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> LOL, for me it's an experimentation, just looking how it will go.
04:59 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Theme not built correctly, core modified to no end and everything is just used in the wrong way.
04:59 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Lucky you.
05:00 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> I had a similar project before, (not liferay though), had to rebuild from scratch.
05:01 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> man, the GUI was so ugly and complicated, that if you click on any of the links while the page loaded, the session goes out of the window.
10:02 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey rotty3000 -- can I ask yo ua design question around some search requirements I have?
10:02 <@rotty3000:#liferay> shoot
10:02 < jardineworks:#liferay> cool
10:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> rotty3000, So my project needs a form of federated search. I know that portlet #3 can support this using OpenSearch -- but I have never done it before. Web Content comes out of LR but there are several entities (which could probably be in Liferay but are not) that I have to call a REST service to search. The REST services suck donkey balls. The best I can hope for is a JSON response. I have basically 3 days to do this. The options I see a
10:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> re...
10:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> 1. User #3 and plug in open search interfaces for flyers, recipes (when the impl classes call the services)
10:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> 2. Create a custom portlet that uses the Search APIs and then merges those results with service call results.
10:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> .. and I feel like there was a third but I forgot it :)
10:06 < jardineworks:#liferay> rotty3000, I see your name all over the search code and forums .. so any advice you have would be great
10:08 <@rotty3000:#liferay> which portal version?
10:08 < jardineworks:#liferay> 6.1.2 GA3 CE
