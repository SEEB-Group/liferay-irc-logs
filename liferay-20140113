02:55 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> has anyone successfully merged navbar with dockbar (or, vice-versa)?
04:17 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Good morning.
04:17 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Wow...macro names in velocity templates have to be unique?
04:52 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> hmm, odd, I just found about this macros :-)
04:55 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, do you know how to include a macro into the portlet theme?
04:55 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> A macro is nothing but a subroutine inside a velocity template.
04:55 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> You can define them in there and use them.
04:56 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> It's something that only happens in the template. The portlet doesn't even know about it.
04:56 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> (If your portlet even uses velocity templates.)
04:56 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> ok, I was looking a way to combine the docbar and nav bar
04:57 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, actually I was creating a theme. ;-)
04:57 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> So theme, not portlet.
04:57 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> yup
04:57 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> bootstrap one
04:57 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> You can use macros in the velocity templates of your theme as well.
04:57 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I'm not too sure about the details, though.
04:57 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> hmm, thx
04:57 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Never built a theme myself...had to work with the crappy one we've got.
