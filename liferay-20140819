13:24 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey guys --
13:25 < jardineworks:#liferay> I am trying to write an EXT plugin that will make some changes to the EditInstancesAction class. I can't use a struts action (believe me I tried!) so I am stuck with EXT. For some reason though, my class override in the ext doesn't seem to be taking -- it keeps executing the one in the portal-impl.jar. I am placing the class in the ext-impl folder -- is that the wrong place?
13:30 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik, jhf -- any ideas?
13:30 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo, maybe?
13:30 < jardineworks:#liferay> :)
13:32 <@jhf:#liferay> no that sounds right - did you restart after deploy?
13:33 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, I did
13:34 < jardineworks:#liferay> and I can see in the WEB-INF the *-ext.xml file ... and inside it
13:34 < jardineworks:#liferay> 		<file>ext-impl/classes/com/liferay/portlet/admin/action/EditInstanceAction.class</file>
13:34 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, but when I go to the TOMCAT_HOME/lib/ext, my ext-*.jar is empty -- just a META-INF folder :S
13:35 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah then it’s not gonna work
13:35 <@jhf:#liferay> I’ve never played with EXT
13:35 <@jhf:#liferay> but as I understand it, your ext jar file should be on the classpath so that it overrides the one in portal-impl
13:35 <@jhf:#liferay> so if it ain’t in there, something perhaps wrong with the build?
13:36 < jardineworks:#liferay> hmmm
13:36 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, the output from ANT looks ok -- http://pastie.org/9486624
