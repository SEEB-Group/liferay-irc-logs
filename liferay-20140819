13:24 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey guys --
13:25 < jardineworks:#liferay> I am trying to write an EXT plugin that will make some changes to the EditInstancesAction class. I can't use a struts action (believe me I tried!) so I am stuck with EXT. For some reason though, my class override in the ext doesn't seem to be taking -- it keeps executing the one in the portal-impl.jar. I am placing the class in the ext-impl folder -- is that the wrong place?
13:30 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik, jhf -- any ideas?
13:30 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo, maybe?
13:30 < jardineworks:#liferay> :)
13:32 <@jhf:#liferay> no that sounds right - did you restart after deploy?
13:33 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, I did
13:34 < jardineworks:#liferay> and I can see in the WEB-INF the *-ext.xml file ... and inside it
13:34 < jardineworks:#liferay> 		<file>ext-impl/classes/com/liferay/portlet/admin/action/EditInstanceAction.class</file>
13:34 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, but when I go to the TOMCAT_HOME/lib/ext, my ext-*.jar is empty -- just a META-INF folder :S
13:35 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah then it’s not gonna work
13:35 <@jhf:#liferay> I’ve never played with EXT
13:35 <@jhf:#liferay> but as I understand it, your ext jar file should be on the classpath so that it overrides the one in portal-impl
13:35 <@jhf:#liferay> so if it ain’t in there, something perhaps wrong with the build?
13:36 < jardineworks:#liferay> hmmm
13:36 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, the output from ANT looks ok -- http://pastie.org/9486624
13:36 < jardineworks:#liferay> no errors
13:36 < jardineworks:#liferay> but the compile java is blank
13:37 < jardineworks:#liferay> probably should show the class name in there I imagine
13:38 < jardineworks:#liferay> ... why does this feel familiar... hmmm
13:44 <@jhf:#liferay> well I just built a “hello world” ext with that particular class, and ‘ant war’ resulted in a war file with my compiled class in it
13:45 <@jhf:#liferay> sooooo…. perhaps the name of the class is wrong, or the directory name, or something?
13:45 <@jhf:#liferay> can you ‘ant clean’ and then pastie your directory structure of the project?
13:47 < jardineworks:#liferay> sure -- one sec
13:47 < jardineworks:#liferay> (I was using ant deploy)
13:49 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, send via pm
14:24 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo, Do you have your JRebel plugin working with EXT plugins?

16:40 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey jhf -- I thought starting with 6.0 EXT plugins could be hot deployed? (after the initial restart)
17:10 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: I'm back here; I haven't set it up.
17:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo_, I suspect it doesn't work with EXT plugins somehow
17:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> I have an email out to the support team at zeroturnaround
17:12 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: http://www.liferayaddicts.net/blogs/-/blogs/liferay-ext-with-jrebel
17:12 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: note the placement of the xml file
17:16 < bwood:#liferay> has anyone set up maven for 6.2 EE SP7?
17:16 < bwood:#liferay> i've installed the liferay dependencies for SP7 maven
