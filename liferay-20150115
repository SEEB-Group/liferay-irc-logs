08:31 < sm`:#liferay> hello
08:31 < sm`:#liferay> does PortletRequest.getSession() returns the same object as ActionRequest.getPortletSession() ?
10:44 < sm`:#liferay> http://pastebin.com/FJRPH0AS
10:44 < sm`:#liferay> if anyone is around
11:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> csierra, are you around for an arquillian question
11:02 < csierra:#liferay> sure
11:02 < jardineworks:#liferay> csierra, is there a supported archetype with maven for the arquillian stuff?
11:02 < csierra:#liferay> jardineworks, not that I am aware of
11:03 < csierra:#liferay> we are still working on maven support
11:03 < csierra:#liferay> we have a deployment scenario generator
11:03 < csierra:#liferay> but we still have no arquetype
11:03 < csierra:#liferay> https://github.com/arquillian/arquillian-extension-liferay
11:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> right that is what I was looking at :)
11:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> so .. is the best solution to generate my maven projects in the SDK folders ... and then use the ANT targets to generate the code? :)
11:05 < csierra:#liferay> if you have a working maven plugin you should be able to use arquillian by configuring it using regular arquillian components
11:05 < csierra:#liferay> plus the scenario generator
11:06 < csierra:#liferay> so basically… should you follow arquillian guides you should be fine… and the deployment scenario generator let's you not implement the @Deployment getDeployment method
11:06 < csierra:#liferay> it does it for you
11:06 < csierra:#liferay> if you use the SDK we have more examples for that
11:08 < jardineworks:#liferay> csierra, ok -- but don't I need the liferay version in order to get the... sorry, new terms for me... the uh... (one sec)
11:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> the SHRINKWRAP!
11:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> :)
11:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> lol
11:09 < csierra:#liferay> :-)
11:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> the scenario generator...
11:10 < csierra:#liferay> let me see
11:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> no comprendo lo que estas diciendo.
11:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> :D
11:11 < csierra:#liferay> ni yo
11:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> csierra, let me start over :) .. Can I private message you?
11:12 < csierra:#liferay> sure
12:40 < doged:#liferay> .xrp
12:40 < doged:#liferay> .xpy
12:40 < doged:#liferay> oops
12:40 < doged:#liferay> sry
13:41 < winem_:#liferay> jarindeworks: do you use liferay with an ldap for the authentication?
14:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> winem_, in some environments
14:11 < winem_:#liferay> do you always enter the attribute name for the password?
14:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> to date -- yep
14:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> I think you need to in order fo rthe authentication to work (for the LDAP lookup)
14:12 < winem_:#liferay> I spend hours reading openldap documentation and in discussions with ldap experts and all of them told me that this is a huge security risk which should not be supported by openldap per default
14:13 < jardineworks:#liferay> are you using https for you connection?
14:13 < winem_:#liferay> I don't mean the password for the service user. I mean the password where you do the user mapping... e-mail = mail, screenname = cn, and so on
14:13 < winem_:#liferay> yes, sure :-)
14:13 < jardineworks:#liferay> so poo poo the security bullshit
14:14 < jardineworks:#liferay> you could also configure the LDAP server to only allow connections from inside your network
14:14 < jardineworks:#liferay> making it even harder.
14:14 < jardineworks:#liferay> (security harness that is)
14:14 < jardineworks:#liferay> OH!
14:14 < jardineworks:#liferay> no
14:14 < jardineworks:#liferay> I don't bother
14:14 < jardineworks:#liferay> well -- normally what I do is I say LDAP required.
14:15 < winem_:#liferay> hmm... do you know if you have any special acl on the ldap for the service user?
14:15 < jardineworks:#liferay> and then set a property in the portal ext -- one sec I grab it...
14:15 < jardineworks:#liferay>     #
14:15 < jardineworks:#liferay>     # Set this to true to enable password checking by the internal portal
14:15 < jardineworks:#liferay>     # authentication. If set to false, you're essentially delegating password
14:15 < jardineworks:#liferay>     # checking to the authenticators configured in "auth.pipeline.pre" and
14:15 < jardineworks:#liferay>     # "auth.pipeline.post" settings.
14:15 < jardineworks:#liferay>     #
14:15 < winem_:#liferay> I tried 3 properties... let me grab them too
14:15 < jardineworks:#liferay>     auth.pipeline.enable.liferay.check=false
14:15 < jardineworks:#liferay> which basically means
14:16 < jardineworks:#liferay> don't bother checking the password on the User object that is stored in Lfieray
14:16 < winem_:#liferay> damn, this is new to me
