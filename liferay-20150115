08:31 < sm`:#liferay> hello
08:31 < sm`:#liferay> does PortletRequest.getSession() returns the same object as ActionRequest.getPortletSession() ?
10:44 < sm`:#liferay> http://pastebin.com/FJRPH0AS
10:44 < sm`:#liferay> if anyone is around
11:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> csierra, are you around for an arquillian question
11:02 < csierra:#liferay> sure
11:02 < jardineworks:#liferay> csierra, is there a supported archetype with maven for the arquillian stuff?
11:02 < csierra:#liferay> jardineworks, not that I am aware of
11:03 < csierra:#liferay> we are still working on maven support
11:03 < csierra:#liferay> we have a deployment scenario generator
11:03 < csierra:#liferay> but we still have no arquetype
11:03 < csierra:#liferay> https://github.com/arquillian/arquillian-extension-liferay
11:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> right that is what I was looking at :)
11:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> so .. is the best solution to generate my maven projects in the SDK folders ... and then use the ANT targets to generate the code? :)
11:05 < csierra:#liferay> if you have a working maven plugin you should be able to use arquillian by configuring it using regular arquillian components
11:05 < csierra:#liferay> plus the scenario generator
11:06 < csierra:#liferay> so basically… should you follow arquillian guides you should be fine… and the deployment scenario generator let's you not implement the @Deployment getDeployment method
11:06 < csierra:#liferay> it does it for you
11:06 < csierra:#liferay> if you use the SDK we have more examples for that
11:08 < jardineworks:#liferay> csierra, ok -- but don't I need the liferay version in order to get the... sorry, new terms for me... the uh... (one sec)
11:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> the SHRINKWRAP!
11:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> :)
11:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> lol
11:09 < csierra:#liferay> :-)
11:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> the scenario generator...
11:10 < csierra:#liferay> let me see
11:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> no comprendo lo que estas diciendo.
11:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> :D
11:11 < csierra:#liferay> ni yo
11:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> csierra, let me start over :) .. Can I private message you?
11:12 < csierra:#liferay> sure
12:40 < doged:#liferay> .xrp
12:40 < doged:#liferay> .xpy
12:40 < doged:#liferay> oops
12:40 < doged:#liferay> sry
13:41 < winem_:#liferay> jarindeworks: do you use liferay with an ldap for the authentication?
14:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> winem_, in some environments
14:11 < winem_:#liferay> do you always enter the attribute name for the password?
14:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> to date -- yep
14:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> I think you need to in order fo rthe authentication to work (for the LDAP lookup)
14:12 < winem_:#liferay> I spend hours reading openldap documentation and in discussions with ldap experts and all of them told me that this is a huge security risk which should not be supported by openldap per default
14:13 < jardineworks:#liferay> are you using https for you connection?
14:13 < winem_:#liferay> I don't mean the password for the service user. I mean the password where you do the user mapping... e-mail = mail, screenname = cn, and so on
14:13 < winem_:#liferay> yes, sure :-)
14:13 < jardineworks:#liferay> so poo poo the security bullshit
14:14 < jardineworks:#liferay> you could also configure the LDAP server to only allow connections from inside your network
14:14 < jardineworks:#liferay> making it even harder.
14:14 < jardineworks:#liferay> (security harness that is)
14:14 < jardineworks:#liferay> OH!
14:14 < jardineworks:#liferay> no
14:14 < jardineworks:#liferay> I don't bother
14:14 < jardineworks:#liferay> well -- normally what I do is I say LDAP required.
14:15 < winem_:#liferay> hmm... do you know if you have any special acl on the ldap for the service user?
14:15 < jardineworks:#liferay> and then set a property in the portal ext -- one sec I grab it...
14:15 < jardineworks:#liferay>     #
14:15 < jardineworks:#liferay>     # Set this to true to enable password checking by the internal portal
14:15 < jardineworks:#liferay>     # authentication. If set to false, you're essentially delegating password
14:15 < jardineworks:#liferay>     # checking to the authenticators configured in "auth.pipeline.pre" and
14:15 < jardineworks:#liferay>     # "auth.pipeline.post" settings.
14:15 < jardineworks:#liferay>     #
14:15 < winem_:#liferay> I tried 3 properties... let me grab them too
14:15 < jardineworks:#liferay>     auth.pipeline.enable.liferay.check=false
14:15 < jardineworks:#liferay> which basically means
14:16 < jardineworks:#liferay> don't bother checking the password on the User object that is stored in Lfieray
14:16 < winem_:#liferay> damn, this is new to me
14:16 < jardineworks:#liferay> if you have LDAP required then the user MUST successfully auth with OpenLDAP or whatever
14:16 < jardineworks:#liferay> so if they do...
14:16 < jardineworks:#liferay> then there is no point in checking the user login in Liferay. You are technically deferring login to your directory store.
14:17 < jardineworks:#liferay> and the user object in liferay is only needed for Liferay context.
14:17 < winem_:#liferay> http://pastie.org/private/rojkejfzrk4bhwfnvy0zw this are the parameters I used to play around
14:17 < jardineworks:#liferay> but for the record, if you import the password, by default it is stored encrypted in the DB. And you can configure the encryption algorithm.
14:18 < winem_:#liferay> so you just set auth.pipeline.enable.liferay.check=false ?
14:18 < winem_:#liferay> yes, but actually, the password is not shown when I click on... let me check...
14:18 < jardineworks:#liferay> yep -- and make sure the ldap.required (or the checkbox in the control panel) is true/checked.
14:18 < winem_:#liferay> Test LDAP users
14:19 < winem_:#liferay> I won't like to check this box before I know that it works with the ldap...
14:19 < jardineworks:#liferay> and of course make sure the screen name, email, first and last are mapping correctly :)
14:19 < winem_:#liferay> but I may reset it in the database, hm?
14:19 < winem_:#liferay> ok, I will try it accordingly to your recommendation give me a few minutes
14:20 < winem_:#liferay> I know there was a way to ensure that liferay read all parameters from the portal-ext.properties, but I can't remember...
14:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> winem_, remember... if you did anyting in the control panel for the portal's authentication, then the portal-ext settings are no longer considered.
14:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> you need to look up the record in the PortalPreferences table and delete it.
14:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> filter on companyId, which you can get from the VirtualHost table
14:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> (based on your hostname)
14:21 < winem_:#liferay> oh, really? the docs say that you should decide between configuration via portal-ext.properties or the gui. if you have a mix up of both, the values in the database are prefered even if they also exist in the portal properties
14:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> correct
14:22 < winem_:#liferay> you make all your ldap configuration via the portal-ext.properties?
14:22 < jardineworks:#liferay> so if you check the checkbox in the gui... hit save, then the PortalPreferences table will have a record for your company. Now all the portal-ext stuff is ignored. BUT! wors...
14:22 < jardineworks:#liferay> if you UNCHECK it..
14:23 < jardineworks:#liferay> it does not delete from the PortalPreferences... so all the reference to the property that are loaded using the class PrefsPropsUtil.getXXX... will grab the value from the table. If the value is null.. then it will use a default rather than read the portal-ext setting
14:23 < winem_:#liferay> ok, just to be clear. are ALL ldap-properties in the portal-ext.properties ignored or only those that are not already set in the database?
14:23 < jardineworks:#liferay> Liferay's recommendation is to use the GUI whenever you can
14:23 < jardineworks:#liferay> because it does not require restarts (is the principle reason)
14:23 < winem_:#liferay> yes, this is what I did so far
14:24 < jardineworks:#liferay> as far as I know it's ALL
14:24 < jardineworks:#liferay> but I have never acturally validated that
14:24 < winem_:#liferay> ok
14:24 < winem_:#liferay> hmmm... how to proceed now..
14:24 < jardineworks:#liferay> whats yoru host name?
14:25 < jardineworks:#liferay> actually
14:25 < jardineworks:#liferay> doesn't matter
14:25 < jardineworks:#liferay> do this --
14:25 < jardineworks:#liferay> 1. Configure it all in the GUI, omitting the password mapping
14:25 < jardineworks:#liferay> 2. Add the auth.pipeline.enable.liferay.check=false to the portal-ext
14:26 < jardineworks:#liferay> 3. Drop all your users from the database (EXCEPT YOUR ADMIN!)
14:26 < winem_:#liferay> can't omit the password mapping
14:26 < jardineworks:#liferay> 4. In the control panel if you haven't already, go to Users and Organizations section, Password Policies, Edit the default passwrod policy and remove the "force change" check box.
14:27 < winem_:#liferay> it says "The above results include users which are missing the required attributes (Screen Name, Password, Email Address, First Name, and Last Name). These users will not be imported until these attributes are filled in. " when I click on Test LDAP Users
14:27 < jardineworks:#liferay> 5. Set the password to be auto generated
14:27 < winem_:#liferay> hey, this might be a good point! let me check that
14:27 < jardineworks:#liferay> 6. Restart liferay
14:27 < jardineworks:#liferay> 7. Log in with one of your LDAP users
14:30 < winem_:#liferay> it works!
14:30 < jardineworks:#liferay> \o/
