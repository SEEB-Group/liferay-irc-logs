02:07 < rocknrol1_> hey all.
02:07 < rocknrol1_> I am trying to get the user groups that have permission to access the current site
02:08 < rocknrol1_> ie. the userGroupId that is in groups_usergroups
02:08 < rocknrol1_> it seems impossible
02:08 < rocknrol1_> I knwo the groupId, so how do I get the corresponding userGroupId from that table?
02:12 < rocknrol1_> in control panel, there is a view, where you can see the groups associated with a site. just dont seem to grasp whats going on there
03:09 < twen> hello
