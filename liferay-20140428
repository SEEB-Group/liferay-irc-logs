02:07 < rocknrol1_> hey all.
02:07 < rocknrol1_> I am trying to get the user groups that have permission to access the current site
02:08 < rocknrol1_> ie. the userGroupId that is in groups_usergroups
02:08 < rocknrol1_> it seems impossible
02:08 < rocknrol1_> I knwo the groupId, so how do I get the corresponding userGroupId from that table?
02:12 < rocknrol1_> in control panel, there is a view, where you can see the groups associated with a site. just dont seem to grasp whats going on there
03:09 < twen> hello
03:30 < Naenyn> bijoo_: Thanks again for all your help. I will follow up on your latest comments in the morning. I have a busy week ahead getting that working.. hopefully it won't take long. =D
04:23 < twen> I'm digging into the DAM side of Liferay. I've created 3 different Metadata set. How can I "attach" these metadata sets to documents, knowing that not all documents will get the 3 sets, but 1, 2 or 3 ?
06:30 < sm`> hello
06:30 < sm`> i dropped the option 1, to use @JSONWebService
06:30 < sm`> i wanna swich and use Spring REST service instead
06:30 < sm`> so i created a @Controller
06:30 < sm`> with desired request mapping
06:31 < sm`> what's next? I tried adding a servlet mapping in web.xml
06:31 < sm`> but i still cant axx the webservice
06:34 < sm`> can anyone recommend few some webresouce/tutorial i can rea
06:34 < sm`> d
07:49 < twen> I've created a web content from a structure and a template. Now I like to reuse it on a sub site... Should I "duplicate" this web content + structure + templte, or I can reuseit, but how ?
08:02 < sm`> when you 'add web content' on a page select the site where you creted your web content 1st
08:02 < sm`> browse the  results, find your desired one
08:03 < sm`> im refering to the filtering options you see when you 'add web content' to a page
08:15 < twen> Oh.. I see... Bummer... :p
08:22 < sm`> ;]
08:24 < twen> ahum.. I must be really stupid :-/
08:25 < twen> I'm on 6.2 btw
08:27 < twen> I'm on my subsite, there is no content available (because it's on the main site). I can add an empty "web content display"
08:28 < twen> but from there.. I can't get the web content from the main site :-/ no srearch display it.
08:28 < sm`> maybe you can add content to  'Global'
08:28 < sm`> if you wanna share it
08:28 < twen> Or is this web content "limited" to the parent site?
08:28 < sm`> between site
08:28 < twen> Oh....
08:29 < twen> that must be the trick :) I try
08:29 < twen> I suppose I can't move the webcontent from the main site to global ?
08:35 < sm`> i believe you can export content from any site an import to any other
08:36 < sm`> not sure tho
08:39 < twen> ok, I found out.. I guess :p
08:39 < twen> I've recreated the structure, template and web content to the global site
08:41 < twen> on the sub site, I add a new web content, and change the scope (in the config tab) from the site to global. go back to setup tab. Now the global webcontent is display :D
08:41 < twen> so you are right... I should shared content to global
08:42 < twen> thanks sm`
09:06 < sm`> np
09:15 -!- mode/#liferay [+o rotty3000] by ChanServ
09:31 < sm`> anyone around to help me out with a Spring REST service. Heres what i did so far: added a servlet in the web.xml, created servletname-servlet.xml to scan for controllers in my package and created a simple @Controller class...
09:31 < sm`> from my understanding and from everything i read about Spring REST this should be enough :D
09:32 < sm`> however i can't axx the simple hello method
09:32 < sm`> What am i missing here?
09:33 < sm`> here's my web.xml, restful-servlet.xml and the controller class - http://pastebin.com/NS9YXh7V
09:34 < sm`> this is pretty much the same with http://www.liferay.com/web/vitor.silva/blog/-/blogs/using-restful-services-with-liferay
09:35 < sm`> except i dont use service builder and i didnt create separated portlet
09:35 < sm`> i wanna add the REST service to existing portlet... and since liferay is using Spring i think i should do what the Srping REST tutorials suggest
09:35 < sm`> so i did
11:23 < sm`> I can see the urls being mapped on deployment

11:24 < sm`> does this mean my controller is not working right
11:24 < sm`> cuz i get 405 error when i try to run it
11:24 < sm`> ?
11:54 < sm`> and why does the guy from the liferay tutorial uses maven and my Lifera IDE doesnt have such option
11:54 < sm`> https://github.com/vitorsilvauk/sample-springmvc-restful-portlet/blob/master/pom.xml
11:54 < sm`> he has pom.xml with jackson dependencies?
11:57 < bijoo_> rocknrol1_: have you setup Liferay debugging there?
11:58 < bijoo_> sm`: have you tried using Resource Phase for this? @ResourceMapping with JSON return?
11:59 < sm`> ive tried all kinds of stuff i never get anything but 405 error
12:00 < sm`> thats hwy i think i havent done the rest of the stuff right
12:00 < sm`> the servlet and dispatcher setup
