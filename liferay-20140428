02:07 < rocknrol1_> hey all.
02:07 < rocknrol1_> I am trying to get the user groups that have permission to access the current site
02:08 < rocknrol1_> ie. the userGroupId that is in groups_usergroups
02:08 < rocknrol1_> it seems impossible
02:08 < rocknrol1_> I knwo the groupId, so how do I get the corresponding userGroupId from that table?
02:12 < rocknrol1_> in control panel, there is a view, where you can see the groups associated with a site. just dont seem to grasp whats going on there
03:09 < twen> hello
03:30 < Naenyn> bijoo_: Thanks again for all your help. I will follow up on your latest comments in the morning. I have a busy week ahead getting that working.. hopefully it won't take long. =D
04:23 < twen> I'm digging into the DAM side of Liferay. I've created 3 different Metadata set. How can I "attach" these metadata sets to documents, knowing that not all documents will get the 3 sets, but 1, 2 or 3 ?
06:30 < sm`> hello
06:30 < sm`> i dropped the option 1, to use @JSONWebService
06:30 < sm`> i wanna swich and use Spring REST service instead
06:30 < sm`> so i created a @Controller
06:30 < sm`> with desired request mapping
06:31 < sm`> what's next? I tried adding a servlet mapping in web.xml
06:31 < sm`> but i still cant axx the webservice
06:34 < sm`> can anyone recommend few some webresouce/tutorial i can rea
06:34 < sm`> d
07:49 < twen> I've created a web content from a structure and a template. Now I like to reuse it on a sub site... Should I "duplicate" this web content + structure + templte, or I can reuseit, but how ?
08:02 < sm`> when you 'add web content' on a page select the site where you creted your web content 1st
08:02 < sm`> browse the  results, find your desired one
08:03 < sm`> im refering to the filtering options you see when you 'add web content' to a page
08:15 < twen> Oh.. I see... Bummer... :p
08:22 < sm`> ;]
08:24 < twen> ahum.. I must be really stupid :-/
08:25 < twen> I'm on 6.2 btw
08:27 < twen> I'm on my subsite, there is no content available (because it's on the main site). I can add an empty "web content display"
08:28 < twen> but from there.. I can't get the web content from the main site :-/ no srearch display it.
08:28 < sm`> maybe you can add content to  'Global'
08:28 < sm`> if you wanna share it
08:28 < twen> Or is this web content "limited" to the parent site?
08:28 < sm`> between site
08:28 < twen> Oh....
08:29 < twen> that must be the trick :) I try
08:29 < twen> I suppose I can't move the webcontent from the main site to global ?
08:35 < sm`> i believe you can export content from any site an import to any other
08:36 < sm`> not sure tho
08:39 < twen> ok, I found out.. I guess :p
08:39 < twen> I've recreated the structure, template and web content to the global site
08:41 < twen> on the sub site, I add a new web content, and change the scope (in the config tab) from the site to global. go back to setup tab. Now the global webcontent is display :D
08:41 < twen> so you are right... I should shared content to global
08:42 < twen> thanks sm`

09:31 < sm`> anyone around to help me out with a Spring REST service. Heres what i did so far: added a servlet in the web.xml, created servletname-servlet.xml to scan for controllers in my package and created a simple @Controller class...
09:31 < sm`> from my understanding and from everything i read about Spring REST this should be enough :D
09:32 < sm`> however i can't axx the simple hello method
09:32 < sm`> What am i missing here?
09:33 < sm`> here's my web.xml, restful-servlet.xml and the controller class - http://pastebin.com/NS9YXh7V
09:34 < sm`> this is pretty much the same with http://www.liferay.com/web/vitor.silva/blog/-/blogs/using-restful-services-with-liferay
09:35 < sm`> except i dont use service builder and i didnt create separated portlet
09:35 < sm`> i wanna add the REST service to existing portlet... and since liferay is using Spring i think i should do what the Srping REST tutorials suggest
09:35 < sm`> so i did
11:23 < sm`> I can see the urls being mapped on deployment
11:24 < sm`> INFO: Initializing Spring FrameworkServlet 'restful'

11:24 < sm`> 15:22:42,234 INFO  [DispatcherServlet:339] FrameworkServlet 'restful': initialization completed in 282 ms
11:24 < sm`> does this mean my controller is not working right
11:24 < sm`> cuz i get 405 error when i try to run it
11:24 < sm`> ?
11:54 < sm`> and why does the guy from the liferay tutorial uses maven and my Lifera IDE doesnt have such option
11:54 < sm`> https://github.com/vitorsilvauk/sample-springmvc-restful-portlet/blob/master/pom.xml
11:54 < sm`> he has pom.xml with jackson dependencies?
11:57 < bijoo_> rocknrol1_: have you setup Liferay debugging there?
11:58 < bijoo_> sm`: have you tried using Resource Phase for this? @ResourceMapping with JSON return?
11:59 < sm`> ive tried all kinds of stuff i never get anything but 405 error
12:00 < sm`> thats hwy i think i havent done the rest of the stuff right
12:00 < sm`> the servlet and dispatcher setup
12:00 < sm`> tho i can see the stuff being initialized
12:00 < sm`> and it looks straightforward ffs
12:04 < bijoo_> sm`: okay, so did you get basic portlet working?
12:05 < bijoo_> sm`: http://code.google.com/p/portletsinaction/
12:05 < bijoo_> sm`: have you looked at the source code there for tips?
12:08 < sm`> i have bunch of portlets in the same project
12:08 < sm`> i want to creat a REST service for them
12:08 < sm`> this is whole book bro ;]
12:09 < sm`> im not complete n00b
12:09 < sm`> i just have problem with this exposing of spring rest service
12:09 < sm`> ive read everything how its done with clean spring, read everything on how to do it in with portlets and i think im doing everything right
12:10 < sm`> i cant understand whats the proble
12:10 < sm`> what im missing
12:16 < bijoo_> sm`: I'd be happy to do screenshare with you; we can setup a time 15 minutes.
12:22 < sm`> im about to leave
12:22 < sm`> and head home
12:22 < sm`> but ill be back later
12:32 < rocknrol1_> bijoo_ :no I havent, but I solved the issue by creating a UserGroupSearch with the themeDisplay().getGroupId() as argument.
12:32 < rocknrol1_> dont have the code with me, but this way I got the groups
12:33 < bijoo_> rocknrol1_: nice that is a great ide here.
12:33 < bijoo_> idea*
12:34 < rocknrol1_> but do tell me more about the debugging :)
12:34 < bijoo_> rocknrol1_: http://www.liferay.com/web/raymond.auge/blog/-/blogs/debugging-liferay-in-eclipse
12:34 < rocknrol1_> thanks!
12:34 < bijoo_> rocknrol1_: it is indispensable for a dev :)
12:36 < rocknrol1_> cool! will set that up :)

13:34 < Naenyn> bijoo_: So, to follow up on what you said.. I think I'm still missing something. In my custom authenticator, I'll pull the user id out of threadlocal.. then go get the user by that id. But, what do I need to do with that user so the portal knows that that user is the one that just logged in?
13:44 < Naenyn> Also, with respect to the authentication pipeline, what is the difference between the login portlet and hitting /c/portal/login directly?
13:58 < Naenyn> Annd.. not sure how to get the ticket from the CAS filter into my custom filter. would have thought it'd be in a cookie. hrm.
14:11 < sm`> fuck me
14:11 < sm`> nobody's helping on the forums too
14:11 < sm`> :D
14:12 < sm`> either*
14:28 < bijoo_> Naenyn: okay, sorry if I confused you there. There are two scenarios to discuss: 1) user logins in via login portlet, 2) logged-in user visits portal first time.
14:28 < bijoo_> 1) the credentials are passed from the login portlet
14:28 < bijoo_> 2) Check the CASAutLogin, you'll see it.
14:29 < bijoo_> It returns an array of Strings here; which usually contain user/password;
14:30 < bijoo_> Naenyn: you may want to set this property then : auth.pipeline.enable.liferay.check=false
14:35 < Naenyn> bijoo_: we want to maintain the login portlet to allow admins to log in locally w/o CAS
14:35 < Naenyn> but the normal login flow would be CAS
14:37 < Naenyn> the login portlet doesn't appear to honor the CAS settings.. it just ignores them and proceeds to use Liferay only for auth.
14:38 < bijoo_> Naenyn: can you create accounts for them on CAS? e.g. create normal account on there; then on Liferay elevate them admins.
14:39 < bijoo_> Naenyn: and you can code in Authenticator; to tell it to treat them differently.
14:39 < bijoo_> e.g. check local db in those cases
14:40 < Naenyn> bijoo_: Yes, we can create accounts on CAS. However, we need to be able to support admin logins even if CAS is offline.
14:41 < Naenyn> So, the login portlet ignores CAS, correct?
15:00 < bijoo_> Naenyn: correct, it knowns nothing about the CAS.
15:01 < sm`> hey bijoo_
15:01 < sm`> you got couple of minutes to check the Spring REST issue
15:01 < sm`> i told you about earlier today?
15:01 < bijoo_> sm`: hey, want to setup time to do screenshare
15:01 < bijoo_> ?
15:01 < sm`> https://www.liferay.com/community/forums/-/message_boards/message/37259058
15:02 < sm`> emm how do we screenshare?
15:02 < sm`> skype?
15:02 < bijoo_> sm`: skype or Google Hangout, lots of ways there
15:02 < bijoo_> sm`: what timezone are you in? I'm EST
15:03 < sm`> utc+1
15:03 < sm`> i can do it now
15:03 < sm`> if thats fine w u
15:03 < bijoo_> sm`: I can spend 5 minutes at the  moment; if longer, we'll have to do tomorrow.

16:42 < Naenyn> bijoo_: ^ that look right to you? it seems to be firing on logout, too..
17:04 < bijoo_> Naenyn: it looks good there; you tried debuggining it? It shouldn't fire on logout at all; e.g. /c/portal/logout
17:08 < Naenyn> bijoo_: Yeah, it fires on logout.. it also fires on login twice (once right before redirect to CAS and once coming back from CAS)
17:08 < Naenyn> bijoo_: Makes me think something isn't quite right.
17:12 < bijoo_> Naenyn: there should be a good reason why it does; I suggesting set breakpoint, debug, and see; go up the stack trace to the invoker; see what the path is and how it's testing; otherwise I'd be happy to screenshare there (to find out why it's calling on logout)
17:22 < sm`> bijoo_, still no luck bro... nobody's answering on #spring or the forums (https://www.liferay.com/community/forums/-/message_boards/message/37259058)
17:22 < sm`> :D
17:22 < sm`> im giving my self a break
17:22 < sm`> ;]
17:22 < Naenyn> I might take you up on that offer. Trying some things first.
17:28 < bijoo_> sm`: good idea, I'll see on my local; if I got something I'll send you tonight.
17:35 < sm`> tnx
17:40 < Naenyn> bijoo_: Are you a Liferay employee or just an enthusiast? =]
