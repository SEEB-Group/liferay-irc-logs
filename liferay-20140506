09:24 < aqquadro> bijoo_sorry for yesterday
09:24 < aqquadro> i've trouble with connectivity
09:24 < aqquadro> are ut here'
09:24 < aqquadro> ?
09:48 < bijoo_> aqquadro: I am here; kind of busy right now. I'll ping you in the next hour here.
09:48 < bijoo_> Meanwhile http://shop.oreilly.com/category/deals/day-against-drm.do?code=DRM2014
09:48 < aqquadro> ok thank u!
12:16 < bijoo_> aqquadro let me know if you're back to check this out.
15:06 < Naenyn> Is it possible to programatically search for users by custom field?
16:52 < bijoo_> Naenyn: Custm Field == Expando
16:52 < bijoo_> Naenyn: I don't know on top of my head right now; probably through indexing you can there; but not sure what right API would be.
16:52 < bijoo_> Naenyn: may want to ask how to search Expandos
17:29 < Naenyn> bijoo_: I didn't think it was possible .. just based on mucking with the UserLocalServiceUtil.
17:30 < Naenyn> I'm reconsidering how I'm going to sync my local user to it's paired user in our external auth system.. I was originally going to store the external user's uuid in the liferay user's uuid field.. can easily look up the user that way .. but if I need to edit the user from the UI, the out-of-the-box functionality doesn't allow that.
17:30 < Naenyn> I'm just not sure what else I'd use..
19:14 < bijoo_> Naenyn: actually it is answered here: http://www.liferay.com/community/wiki/-/wiki/Main/Search+for+objects+by+custom+attributes
19:14 < bijoo_> Naenyn: it goes over exactly what you asked
19:14 < bijoo_> List<ExpandoValue> values = ExpandoValueLocalServiceUtil.getColumnValues(companyId, classNameId, ExpandoTableConstants.DEFAULT_TABLE_NAME, customAttributeName,customAttributeValue, -1, -1);
19:15 < bijoo_> Naenyn: let me know if that does not answer it
19:39 < Naenyn> wt.. how did I miss that
19:40 < Naenyn> bijoo_: thank you! I feel pretty silly now. =]
19:44 < Naenyn> bijoo_: that's a pretty nice writeup actually. Descriptive and simple.
19:44 < Naenyn> better than the average wiki article I've read on liferay.
