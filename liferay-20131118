02:11 < nikiforo:#liferay> Good morning all!
02:11 < nikiforo:#liferay> there is a file: liferay-social.xml. Does anybody knows what this file is about?
02:16 < nikiforo:#liferay> Or where can I get a description what this is about?
05:56 < hufg:#liferay> helloo helloo good monday
07:27 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey topolik1 -- are you around?
07:43 < jardineworks:#liferay> is anyone around who has done and had success with public render parameters? In particular I am trying to get them to work across layouts so that I can share information between portlets on different pages.
07:50 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, any chance you are using this model on your project?
07:56 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik, are you back?
08:00 < hufg:#liferay> jardineworks: i have seen some docs on it!
08:01 < hufg:#liferay> :D

08:06 < jardineworks:#liferay> 3 strings
08:06 < jardineworks:#liferay> its  store locator
08:07 < jardineworks:#liferay> I am passing the store id and the lat and long
08:07 < hufg:#liferay> how long are they?
08:07 < jardineworks:#liferay> id is a couple of letters... and lat long ... the usual.
08:07 < hufg:#liferay> im just saying if you can share them with get param no need for more complex stuff
08:07 < hufg:#liferay> and this includes no lists etc and not too many characters and stuff like that
08:07 < jardineworks:#liferay> well, here is what I have :)
08:08 < jardineworks:#liferay> Page A - Search portlet. Page B TWO portlets, a Details portlet and a Nearby portlet
08:08 < jardineworks:#liferay> so right no in my action phase I get the layout and redirect the user to the nearby portlet iwth the 3 render parameters.
08:08 < jardineworks:#liferay> that works
08:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> problem is, the details portlet can't see the vars :(
08:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> I have never gotten this to work... I remmeber trying it once before and after an entire day burned just giving up
08:10 < hufg:#liferay> mm
08:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> I know I could go the gross session route, but I feel like this is a situation MEANT for public params
08:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> and I don't wnat to use IPC... overly comlex and the data is not private
08:13 < jardineworks:#liferay> I've tried several examples, but none of them work. My suspicion, like most Liferay blog posts, they show just hte most basic example. Two portlets on the same page.
08:13 < jardineworks:#liferay> one of these days when I have more time I am going to start blogging REAL scenarios.
08:13 < jardineworks:#liferay> .. but until then. This sucks :)
08:13 < hufg:#liferay> hehe
08:15 < jardineworks:#liferay> I know for sharing vars in the session you can use LIFERAY_SHARED... and I also know that Public Render Parameters are stored in the session as well. In fact I can see the setting --
08:15 < jardineworks:#liferay>  session.shared.attributes=COMPANY_,LIFERAY_SHARED_,org.apache.struts.action.LOCALE,PORTLET_RENDER_PARAMETERS_,PUBLIC_RENDER_PARAMETERS_POOL_,USER_
08:17 < jardineworks:#liferay> also ,,, the parameters going to the nearby stores portlet is not being passed as a public param. I can tell that because when I output the Public Parameter Map in the render phase it has a size of 0
08:17 < jardineworks:#liferay> so clearly it is only getting the values because I am passing them as portlet params
08:21 < hufg:#liferay> mm
08:21 < hufg:#liferay> a get paremeter with prefix and be done with it 8)
08:23 < jardineworks:#liferay> you mean do /store/details?storeId=...
08:23 < jardineworks:#liferay> ?
08:23 < hufg:#liferay> yes
08:24 < jardineworks:#liferay> can you just use the ParamUtil.getString to pull it back?
08:24 < hufg:#liferay> _500_storeId=123&_500_lat=123.1234.34&_500_long=23.324
08:25 < hufg:#liferay> i do not know but it would be strange not to get access to them?
08:25 < hufg:#liferay> by prefix i mean just clearly group the params
08:25 < jardineworks:#liferay> I suppose ultimately you could get the underlying httprequest and pull out the query string
08:25 < jardineworks:#liferay> argh... where is a liferay employe when you need one! :)
08:26 < hufg:#liferay> you are doing a "basic" portlet with render and action phases
08:26 < hufg:#liferay> ?
08:27 < jardineworks:#liferay> yeah
08:27 < jardineworks:#liferay> well, I have 3 portlets
08:27 < jardineworks:#liferay> one for the search, one for the details, and one for nearby stores
08:30 < jardineworks:#liferay> the search is on one layout (/stores/search)
08:30 < jardineworks:#liferay> the other two on a separate layout -- stores/details.
08:50 < hufg:#liferay> imo if you can get to the httprequest you can just use some api fcall to get the param
08:53 < hufg:#liferay> when is deployment/undeployment of structures/templates coming!?
08:53 < hufg:#liferay> would make life better imo
09:13 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Hey guys. Does somebody know if the image upload fields in web content structures store their files in the documents library?
09:16 -!- mode/#liferay [+o rotty3000] by ChanServ
09:23 < hufg:#liferay> in 6.1GA2 they do not
09:24 < hufg:#liferay> just add an image and see the url
09:24 < hufg:#liferay> it may be stored in the document library but not accessed from the document library though
09:26 < hufg:#liferay> didn't investigate more jsut checked that the access url is different
09:34 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Yes. I saw the URLs as well.
09:35 < hufg:#liferay> digg into sturts-config.xml and see what happens 8)
09:35 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Yuck
10:06 < aj_:#liferay> hey rotty3000 -- can I bug you about public render parameters for a minute?
10:07 <@rotty3000:#liferay> hey, I can try to answer
10:07 < aj_:#liferay> k thanks... here is what I have
10:08 < aj_:#liferay> Layout A with Portlet A. This is a search that also shows the users the results. The user can select one of the results to go to a new layout -- a Details Layout. The Details layout has two portlets on it. The first is the details information .. the second are nearby locations (this is a store search)
10:09 < aj_:#liferay> I need to get the storeId from Layout A to Layout B so that the portlets on Layout B will see it.
10:09 <@rotty3000:#liferay> ok
10:09 < aj_:#liferay> I have been trying to do this with public render parameters
10:09 <@rotty3000:#liferay> right
10:09 <@rotty3000:#liferay> sounds reasonable
10:09 < aj_:#liferay> ,... either I am doing it wrong (most likely lol) or it doesnt't work :)
10:10 <@rotty3000:#liferay> so, you need to declare the prp in every portlet
10:10 <@rotty3000:#liferay> and the namespace has to be identical for all
10:10 <@rotty3000:#liferay> I mean the URI namespace in the definition in portlet.xml
10:11 < aj_:#liferay> right... so I have one portlet.xml file... and I have just before the closing portlet-app tag the definition. Then for each portlet I have the supported-... blah blah blah ... where the ids between the two match
10:11 < aj_:#liferay> let me pastebin for you
10:12 <@rotty3000:#liferay> here is a working example of a plugin using a PRP of the portal https://github.com/rotty3000/liferay-plugins/blob/master/portlets/wiki-navigation-portlet/docroot/WEB-INF/portlet.xml#L78
10:13 < aj_:#liferay> rotty3000, http://pastebin.com/pkzNZpB9
10:13 < aj_:#liferay> checking your link as well
10:13 <@rotty3000:#liferay> brb
10:14 < aj_:#liferay> ok looks the same to me
10:14 < aj_:#liferay> so the problem must be in how I set it.
10:15 < aj_:#liferay> on my side what I do is in the search portlet I have an actionURL. The process action should set the render parameters right?
10:29 < aj_:#liferay> rotty3000, lemme know when you are back...
10:32 <@rotty3000:#liferay> the action url must set the render parameter
10:32 <@rotty3000:#liferay> sorry
10:33 <@rotty3000:#liferay> the process action must set the render parameter... I can't recall if copy is explicit..
10:35 < aj_:#liferay> rotty3000, so then... once I do actionResonse.setRenderParameter(...) I can no longer redirect right? so then how do I redirect the user to the other layout?
10:35 <@rotty3000:#liferay> you can create a render url in the processAction, and explicitely redirect to it
10:41 < aj_:#liferay> but
10:42 < aj_:#liferay> rotty3000, when I tried to do a response.sendRedirect (after setting the render parameters) I got an illegal state exception
10:43 <@rotty3000:#liferay> don't call that method
10:43 <@rotty3000:#liferay> set the param on the created url
10:43 < aj_:#liferay> sorry? I'm not following.
11:00 < aj_:#liferay> rotty3000, when you say created url, you mean the PortalUtil.getCurrentURL( portletRequest) ?
11:01 <@rotty3000:#liferay> no
11:04 <@rotty3000:#liferay> PortletURL url = PortletURLFactoryUtil.create(actionRequest, "my_target_portlet", plid, PortletRequest.RENDER_PHASE);
11:05 <@rotty3000:#liferay> then redirect to url.toString() after having set the prp on it
11:05 < aj_:#liferay> rotty3000, ok,, I have that in the process action... and then I tried to do actionResponse.sendRedirect( url.toString() ); and that is when I got the erorr
11:05 < aj_:#liferay> let me try it again in case I am mixing stuff up
11:11 < aj_:#liferay> rotty3000, so when I try that I get this everytime -- java.lang.IllegalStateException: Set render parameter has already been called
11:11 <@rotty3000:#liferay> is your snippet up to date?
11:13 < aj_:#liferay> I just sent the portlet.xml... one sec I'll do my process action.
11:14 < aj_:#liferay> http://pastebin.com/LQdGAwbi
11:20 <@rotty3000:#liferay> aj_: the correct code is commented
11:20 <@rotty3000:#liferay> you should uncomment it, and remove the lines at 34,35,36
11:20 < aj_:#liferay> rotty3000, you mean the setParameter() statements?
11:21 <@rotty3000:#liferay> yeah
11:21 < aj_:#liferay> rotty3000, so that is the problem. I need those parameters to go to TWO portlets on the other layout
11:21 < aj_:#liferay> when I was doing that, my target (nearbystores) portlet works, but the store details cant find a store id
11:21 < aj_:#liferay> and when I output the public parameter map in BOTH portlets, both have a 0 list size.
11:22 <@rotty3000:#liferay> so? both portlets will see the prp params even if they are directed to only one of them
11:22 <@rotty3000:#liferay> provided the prps are properly configured
11:22 < aj_:#liferay> rotty3000,  that's what I thought... but its not what I am seeing :(
11:22 < aj_:#liferay> rotty3000, did my portlet.xml look ok to you?
11:22 <@rotty3000:#liferay> what does the resulting url look like when you do that?
11:22 <@rotty3000:#liferay> sorry, checking
11:24 <@rotty3000:#liferay> btw.. why did you put your param in Liferay's uri namespace ? you should use one of your own naming to make sure there is no collisions
11:25 <@rotty3000:#liferay> however, that's not the problem I don't think, just would be better
11:26 <@rotty3000:#liferay> so, when you get the resulting url, can you pastie it?
11:29 < aj_:#liferay> sure one sec.
11:29 < aj_:#liferay> you wanna see the render url right?
11:32 < aj_:#liferay> rotty3000, URL: http://localhost:8080/web/guest/stores/details?p_p_id=nearbystores_WAR_storelocatorportlet&p_p_lifecycle=0&_nearbystores_WAR_storelocatorportlet_PUBLIC_PARAM_SELECTED_STORE_ID=4&_nearbystores_WAR_storelocatorportlet_PUBLIC_PARAM_SELECTED_STORE_LAT=33.6001826&_nearbystores_WAR_storelocatorportlet_PUBLIC_PARAM_SELECTED_STORE_LONG=-111.9786615
11:33 <@rotty3000:#liferay> your param name is wrong
11:33 < aj_:#liferay> :|
11:33 < aj_:#liferay> omg
11:33 <@rotty3000:#liferay> and therefore is not recongnized as the prp
11:34 < aj_:#liferay> :|
11:35 <@rotty3000:#liferay> .. it happens
11:35 <@rotty3000:#liferay> usually after we've spent hours looking at the same code
11:35 <@rotty3000:#liferay> it all gets fuzzy and these details escape us
11:35 <@rotty3000:#liferay> :)
11:38 < aj_:#liferay> 50 hours in about 3 days
11:38 < aj_:#liferay> I'm seeing all sorts of stuff
11:38 < aj_:#liferay> I could be the mayor of Toronto :)
12:15 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Phew.
12:16 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> What a day...
12:16 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Do any of you know if Liferay has some kind of caching for file retrieval from the documents library?
12:17 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I get the feeling that loading images and JSON files from the DL (which is configured to use S3) quickly could become a bottleneck..
12:19 <@rotty3000:#liferay> aj_: ;)
13:29 < aj_:#liferay> hey guys
13:30 < aj_:#liferay> has anyone had a problem moving a theme that was originally deployed on a 1.6 jdk version of the portal/plugin to  a version of the portal that runs on 1.7?
15:05 < aj_:#liferay> rotty3000, will the public render parameter stuff work if I use friendly urls and a user bookmarks it?
15:06 <@rotty3000:#liferay> yeah, it should
15:06 < aj_:#liferay> rotty3000, sweet.... I haven't looked at the friendly url stuff. Scale of 1 - 10 (10 being painful) how hard to get it going quickly?
15:07 <@rotty3000:#liferay> should be merely format patterns
15:07 <@rotty3000:#liferay> i.e. configuration
15:07 <@rotty3000:#liferay> I'd say it should be no more than 3-4
15:08 < aj_:#liferay> rotty3000, great. That's about as much time as I have haha
