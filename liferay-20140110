05:38 < rrapozo:#liferay> jhf: I can say how you help me!!! Thanks a lot! The progress bar it working perfectly in liferay 6.2
06:41 < sl33k:#liferay> I am using JkMount in my tomcat app, but try as i may, mod_jk is refusing to load the path to my css and js. its a liferay app. and the css/js are in a themes folder which is basically still a webapp folde. I am also using JkMount /* ajp13
06:41 < sl33k:#liferay> (12:33:34 PM) sl33k: anyone with a clue on what to do?
06:41 < sl33k:#liferay> happy new year to you all btw
07:54 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik, I am so close to getting this url thing working -- but I have one thing not working. I've been starting at it for nearly a day with no joy. Any chance you have time to play a second set of eyes?
07:54 < topolik:#liferay> hi jardineworks, sure
07:56 < jardineworks:#liferay> I wrote the js function and it builds the url. I started with fabricating the values I wanted and then doing the maps. Works fine. Then I added in the concatenationation of the selected ctegories. I added the fields to the route... but for some reason they are not coming out on the other side.
07:57 < jardineworks:#liferay> can I screen share with you? might be easiest -- or I can offer you a million pastebin links hahaha
07:59 < topolik:#liferay> ok, how was that program called, I always forget :D
07:59 < topolik:#liferay> mikogo?
08:00 < jardineworks:#liferay> yeah
08:00 < jardineworks:#liferay> :)
08:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik, I sent you a pm in case you didn't notice
13:06 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik, unbelievable. If I move the SAME custom friendly url mapper to my dummy portlet, it breaks where the point is set. If I put it in the article portlet... its like its not even there.
13:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik, I think i have withered it down to the end problem. we might have already discussed this.. i'm losing ttrack along with my mind. If I don't put the tags and categories in the route as ignored parameters then they make it over to the server. As soon as I add them (to get them out of the url) they stop gettting over.
13:30 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik, another update. I have the custom mapper working but the copy from parent to inheritting class doesn't work. By the time we get there they're out of the parent :( .. maybe I can save them
13:35 < jardineworks:#liferay> nope.
15:50 < rfonseca:#liferay> Hi, I'm trying to download documents from a remote liferay server. I'm able to get the FileEntry, but how do I get the file's content?
15:56 < apucay:#liferay> hmmm, i don't think the getFileAsStream methods are exposed
16:00 < rfonseca:#liferay> apucay: yeah. What's the right way to do it?
16:01 < rfonseca:#liferay> I tried via http, but maybe I'm not using the right URL. I can't get past the login screen
16:05 < apucay:#liferay> are you trying to get the data from within a browser, or code running on the server side?
16:08 < rfonseca:#liferay> apucay: code running on the client side
