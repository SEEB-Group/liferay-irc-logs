07:16 < plekplek:#liferay> hey everyone. quick question: does liferay support tag localization out of the box?
08:36 < bijoo_:#liferay> plekplek: I am pretty sure all tags support; since the use LanguageUtil for that.
08:36 < bijoo_:#liferay> plekplek: if not, then it's probably just a bug; which can be fixed via a hook plugin.
08:56 < bwood:#liferay> hey everyone
08:56 < bwood:#liferay> I was curious if anyone from the #liferay community has made money via Liferay marketplace
08:56 < bwood:#liferay> most users for my apps just use the trial and don't purchase
12:09 < ikb:#liferay> hi all
15:10 < bijoo_:#liferay> ikb: hello
15:10 < bijoo_:#liferay> bwood: hey, I know other people have made some; as for me, I haven't published paid apps.
15:12 < bijoo_:#liferay> bwood: most likely you will need to sell your app; e.g. tell client on project it's worth; rather than them re-invent the app wheel (since it'd cost them more to dev it themself)
15:12 < bijoo_:#liferay> bwood: I talked to these guys if that's how they did : http://www.liferay.com/marketplace/-/mp/application/41057634
15:13 < bijoo_:#liferay> bwood: and they said their client does use the app
15:13 < bwood:#liferay> well my apps are themes
15:13 < bwood:#liferay> and a responsive layout for 6.1
15:14 < bwood:#liferay> it replaced all the default layouts for liferay 6.1
