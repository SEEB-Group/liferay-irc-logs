07:16 < plekplek:#liferay> hey everyone. quick question: does liferay support tag localization out of the box?
08:36 < bijoo_:#liferay> plekplek: I am pretty sure all tags support; since the use LanguageUtil for that.
08:36 < bijoo_:#liferay> plekplek: if not, then it's probably just a bug; which can be fixed via a hook plugin.
08:56 < bwood:#liferay> hey everyone
08:56 < bwood:#liferay> I was curious if anyone from the #liferay community has made money via Liferay marketplace
08:56 < bwood:#liferay> most users for my apps just use the trial and don't purchase
12:09 < ikb:#liferay> hi all
15:10 < bijoo_:#liferay> ikb: hello
15:10 < bijoo_:#liferay> bwood: hey, I know other people have made some; as for me, I haven't published paid apps.
15:12 < bijoo_:#liferay> bwood: most likely you will need to sell your app; e.g. tell client on project it's worth; rather than them re-invent the app wheel (since it'd cost them more to dev it themself)
15:12 < bijoo_:#liferay> bwood: I talked to these guys if that's how they did : http://www.liferay.com/marketplace/-/mp/application/41057634
15:13 < bijoo_:#liferay> bwood: and they said their client does use the app
15:13 < bwood:#liferay> well my apps are themes
15:13 < bwood:#liferay> and a responsive layout for 6.1
15:14 < bwood:#liferay> it replaced all the default layouts for liferay 6.1
15:14 < bwood:#liferay> and forces the default layouts to stack after window has reached a breakpoint
15:14 < bijoo_:#liferay> bwood: so while consulting you can market it (e.g. if the client needs like your theme)
15:15 < bwood:#liferay> http://www.liferay.com/marketplace/-/mp/application/38176595
15:15 < bwood:#liferay> for example I made one of the layouts for free
15:15 < bijoo_:#liferay> bwood: or create a theme gallery type site; to increase your theme visibility
15:16 < bwood:#liferay> the downloads stat on marketplace can be misleading
15:16 < bwood:#liferay> because alot of people can download during a trial
15:16 < bwood:#liferay> but no one purchase the app
15:17 < bwood:#liferay> I only have one more theme I'm allowed to finish for marketplace
15:17 < bwood:#liferay> since I work for a partner company
15:17 < bwood:#liferay> moving forwards any apps I build will fall under the company's profile
15:18 < bijoo_:#liferay> bwood: I see; I'm not up to date on those rules
15:19 < bwood:#liferay> well it's my company's rule
15:19 < bijoo_:#liferay> bwood: sounds pretty tough if it is just one app; you could always keep churning new ones out (e.g. deactive the old plugin); and in description link to outside site (haha, don't know if this falls in the rules )
15:26 < bijoo_:#liferay> bwood: recently I started a new project; and was looking for a nice mobile theme; I ended up having to write my own; integrated jQuery Mobile theme; it doesn't look perfect with AUI; but it's quite usable and useful now; I would've been willing to pay for it; since it took me a while to build this one; though I would want control on theme settings.
15:27 < bijoo_:#liferay> bwood: I'm thinking on publishing out my theme; but no time to polish and fix small things.
15:27 < bwood:#liferay> when I used to worked at Liferay, I worked through the pattern of including web content via theme settings
15:27 < bwood:#liferay> so that the web content could still be localized
15:28 < bijoo_:#liferay> bwood: yes that's example of what I mean too; or letting user choose the theme colors; some basic stuff that would go a long way.
15:29 < bijoo_:#liferay> color scheme, web content header/footer.
15:30 < bwood:#liferay> When I get a chance I'll release an ecommerce theme
15:30 < bwood:#liferay> using paypal
15:30 < bwood:#liferay> input your merchant ID and it's good to go
15:31 < bijoo_:#liferay> bwood: cool, I like your Architekt Theme on there
15:32 < bwood:#liferay> thanks
15:32 < bwood:#liferay> for 6.2 I rebuilt it from the ground up
15:33 < bwood:#liferay> once this is added https://issues.liferay.com/browse/LPS-51623
15:33 < bwood:#liferay> it will add alot of flexibility for the resources importer
15:35 < bijoo_:#liferay> bwood: cool, that'd be nice to showcase on install
15:39 < jardineworks:#liferay> bwood, I have a bunch of resource importer edits I am working on... maybe I can include that one to help push you along :)
15:45 < bwood:#liferay> that would be great
15:45 < bwood:#liferay> thanks
