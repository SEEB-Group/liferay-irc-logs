09:50 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Hey guys.
09:51 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Anyone got experience with using S3 with Liferay?
09:51 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I'm currently wondering what exactly happens when a document is being requested that is actually stored on S3.
09:52 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Does Liferay stream the content from S3 to the user or is the user being redirected to S3?
09:52 <@jhf:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur: it redirects to S3 I believe. checking.
09:52 <@jhf:#liferay> also I am assuming you are referring to the use of the S3 document library storage hook
