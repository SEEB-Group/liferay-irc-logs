07:34 < ferrema:#liferay> hello
07:35 < ferrema:#liferay> i was wondering if there was a way of setting liferay.home in the startup script (eg. catalina.sh)

09:50 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Hey guys.
09:51 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Anyone got experience with using S3 with Liferay?
09:51 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I'm currently wondering what exactly happens when a document is being requested that is actually stored on S3.
09:52 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Does Liferay stream the content from S3 to the user or is the user being redirected to S3?
09:52 <@jhf:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur: it redirects to S3 I believe. checking.
09:52 <@jhf:#liferay> also I am assuming you are referring to the use of the S3 document library storage hook
09:53 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Yes, exactly.
09:53 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> From what I can see, there is no redirect...Liferay sends a 200 und then I'm receiving the file.
09:54 <@jhf:#liferay> hmm
09:54 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah I think yer right!
09:54 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> That's not good. -.-
09:54 <@jhf:#liferay> https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/blob/4215f8c402c4753dc8fab7c89f06562b6dc8aa8e/portal-impl/src/com/liferay/portlet/documentlibrary/store/S3Store.java#L194
09:54 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> This will cause some f*ed up traffic increase on our Liferay.
09:55 <@jhf:#liferay> wonder if there is a config to disable straming
09:55 <@jhf:#liferay> streaming..
09:55 <@jhf:#liferay> since there seems to be a non-streamed access code in there too
09:57 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I only see getFile() instead of getFileAsStream().
09:57 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> So you see something I don't?
09:57 <@jhf:#liferay> I see both
09:57 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Because getFile() seems to download the file and then return it.
09:57 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Which seems to be just as bad.
09:58 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah, I guess yer right. so when you click on 'download' you want it to be a URL directly to the S3 storage location, not copied to a temp directory and served via liferay (or liferay's web server that fronts it)
09:59 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> It would also be okay if Liferay replied with a Location header and a 301 or something.
10:00 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Because the idea is to have a permanent URL for the document, which is totally unrelated to the actual storage location.
10:02 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah I'm not seeing that option. presumably the connection to S3 requires auth (I see settings for keys and such in portal.propertieS) and the end user (and their browser) can't currently supply this
10:02 <@jhf:#liferay> so the data must be accessed from the (configured for auth) server?
10:02 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> You can set an S3 to public.
10:02 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> We do that actually.
10:02 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Any user can access any file on there if he knows the URL.
10:05 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah I'm not seeing a possibility to configure the store to give you a direct URL vs. streaming the file
10:41 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf,  since you guys are on the subject in a way. Is it possible to access an item that is in the document library (image) outside the portal context? Is that a WebDAV thingee?
10:46 <@jhf:#liferay> jardineworks: that's one way, yeah. I mean, it's still Liferay (via a webdav library) that is serving the file.
10:46 <@jhf:#liferay> so sorta/kinda in the "portal context" still but not really.
10:54 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, is there another way?
10:54 < jardineworks:#liferay> I'm looking for the easiest possible here
10:54 <@jhf:#liferay> what do you mean "outside the portal context"
10:54 <@jhf:#liferay> there is a URL you can get via DL
10:54 <@jhf:#liferay> is that URL acceptable?
10:54 <@jhf:#liferay> it goes through the doclib portlet I believe.
