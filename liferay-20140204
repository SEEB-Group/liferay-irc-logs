09:50 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Hey guys.
09:51 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Anyone got experience with using S3 with Liferay?
09:51 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I'm currently wondering what exactly happens when a document is being requested that is actually stored on S3.
09:52 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Does Liferay stream the content from S3 to the user or is the user being redirected to S3?
09:52 <@jhf:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur: it redirects to S3 I believe. checking.
09:52 <@jhf:#liferay> also I am assuming you are referring to the use of the S3 document library storage hook
09:53 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Yes, exactly.
09:53 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> From what I can see, there is no redirect...Liferay sends a 200 und then I'm receiving the file.
09:54 <@jhf:#liferay> hmm
09:54 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah I think yer right!
09:54 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> That's not good. -.-

09:54 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> This will cause some f*ed up traffic increase on our Liferay.
09:55 <@jhf:#liferay> wonder if there is a config to disable straming
09:55 <@jhf:#liferay> streaming..
09:55 <@jhf:#liferay> since there seems to be a non-streamed access code in there too
