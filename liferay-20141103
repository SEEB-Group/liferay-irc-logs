11:22 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, \o/!
11:23 <@jhf:#liferay> heya :) Last week to travel - in Germany for DevCon!!
11:23 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, oh yeah! super jealous.
11:23 < jardineworks:#liferay> mostly because I love german food :)
11:25 <@jhf:#liferay> heh.. well my checked bag with the contributor awards and tee shirts did not make it :( supposed to arrive tomorrow in the AM
11:25 < jardineworks:#liferay> when does the conference start?
11:25 < jardineworks:#liferay> the 5th?
11:39 < douglascrp:#liferay> hello
11:39 < douglascrp:#liferay> I'm trying to use portlet-model-hints.xml to try to let liferay generate the right form's inputs, but it seems it's ignoring all the config I create
11:40 < douglascrp:#liferay> all I get are text inputs... no text area at all
11:54 < jardineworks:#liferay> douglascrp, did you try doing a mvn clean and then a mvn liferay:build-service?
11:54 < douglascrp:#liferay> only using liferay ide, on eclipse
11:55 < douglascrp:#liferay> but let me try again using shell
11:55 < douglascrp:#liferay> when I run run build service, I see it changes the classes where columns' sizes are defined, but I don't see any difference on html forms
11:55 < douglascrp:#liferay> I'm using aui:input
11:56 < douglascrp:#liferay> trying your suggestion now
11:56 < douglascrp:#liferay> jardineworks, am I wrong to assume that if I define <hint name="display-height">75</hint>
11:56 < douglascrp:#liferay> 		<hint name="display-width">500</hint> I should get a text-area field instead of a text input?
11:57 < douglascrp:#liferay> jardineworks, this is my full definition
11:57 < douglascrp:#liferay> <hint-collection name="TEXTAREA">
11:57 < douglascrp:#liferay> 		<hint name="display-height">130</hint>
11:57 < douglascrp:#liferay> 		<hint name="display-width">500</hint>
11:57 < douglascrp:#liferay> 		<hint name="max-length">4000</hint>
11:57 < douglascrp:#liferay> 		<hint name="editor">false</hint>
