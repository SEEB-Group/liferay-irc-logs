09:23 < jardineworks> good morning guys
09:23 < jardineworks> dblessing, you actually there? :)
09:24 < jardineworks> dblessing, I have some form-navigator questions if you are
09:24 < dblessing> hey jardineworks. i'm lurking, yes :)
09:24 < dblessing> jardineworks: i'll do my best. i haven't touched this stuff in a bit...
09:24 < jardineworks> dblessing, haha -- you have time for two questions?
09:24 < jardineworks> dblessing, I was using your blog post as my guide which is why you are the unfortunate soul to field these ;)
09:25 < jardineworks> question #1: The sections. I get that the name of the section must match the name of the JSP. Do you know how I can introduce either underscores or hyphens into the section name and have it map properly? I have a "section" called apikeys .. but I wpuld prefer to name it api-keys if possible.
09:26 < jardineworks> every time I introduce a space, hyphen or underscore though, it breaks -- in that the page does not render anything for the section
09:35 < jardineworks> dblessing, ... processing? :)
09:39 < dblessing> jardineworks: hrm. i'm not sure. let me take a look
11:03 <@rotty3000> would you guys think -XX:MaxPermSize=512 a little high ??
11:03 <@rotty3000> consering a -Xmx1024m ?
11:11 < Tar-Minyatur> Mhm. If I could only remember...I think I read once that having both values the same actually increases the performance.
11:11 < Tar-Minyatur> I investigated that stuff because of a shitty performing ColdFusing instance some months ago..
11:13 <@rotty3000> uhmm, certainly not
11:13 <@rotty3000> if your perm size ever became the same as your heap.. you're dead in the water
11:13 < Tar-Minyatur> Maybe it was another value. Not sure at the moment.
11:13 <@rotty3000> :)
11:13 < Tar-Minyatur> I always get confused about all that stuff.
11:14 < Tar-Minyatur> Especially when I didn't touch it for a while.
11:14 <@rotty3000> yeah, initial and max being the same in production avoid memory churn
11:14 < Tar-Minyatur> Oh right. Might have been that. Damn it. The way my brain confuses information sometimes...
11:15 <@rotty3000> but the perm gen, and the heap have to have a non 1:1 ration.. I was thinking that 1:2 would be too much permgen
11:15 <@rotty3000> I'm thinking more like max_perm=256 heap=1024 might be better
11:16 < Tar-Minyatur> Mhm. Are you sure that it's even reasonable to have a general rule like that?
11:16 < Tar-Minyatur> I would guess that it's very dependent on the application.
11:16 <@rotty3000> the issue being that our packaging of Glassfish is setting the defaults to max_perm=512:heap=1025, which I think is not a good default
11:16 <@rotty3000> absolutely
11:17 <@rotty3000> but Liferay itself has minimums
11:17 <@rotty3000> for instance, Liferay will simply not be able to use all its functions in less that heap<1024
11:18 <@rotty3000> it's far too memory heavy to use less than that
11:18 < Tar-Minyatur> I noticed. ;)
11:18 <@rotty3000> just the permgen needing to be around 256 means that a heap anything less that 4x that amount is necessary
11:19 <@rotty3000> sorry, "nothing less than.." is what I mean
11:19 < Tar-Minyatur> Yeah. I think I heard that one before.
11:20 < Tar-Minyatur> Uh! It's 5:20 already.
11:20 < Tar-Minyatur> Damn. Have to get to the station.
11:20 < Tar-Minyatur> Bye. Have a nice weekend. :)
11:20 <@rotty3000> same to you!
11:43 <@jhf> mr. rotty3000 how are things
11:43 <@rotty3000> ughh...
11:43 <@jhf> this window has been obscured all morning!
11:44 <@rotty3000> I believe I have gotten a handle on the issues with GF
11:44 <@rotty3000> still working out the solution, but I'm getting closer and it's all security related
11:45 <@jhf> is that with GF 4.x?
11:45 <@rotty3000> no
11:45 <@rotty3000> but I think the same problems will arrise given the right circumstances
11:45 <@jhf> yeah.. ok.. reason being, we are gonna make 6.2 bundles with GF 4.x as soon as we can
11:45 <@rotty3000> so, the difference between what you guys were seeing, and what I was seeing
11:45 <@jhf> (after it's tested of course, which would probably involve runnig into the issues you are seeing)
11:46 <@rotty3000> is that I have this default set:           portal.security.manager.strategy=liferay
11:46 <@rotty3000> and you guys have this:  portal.security.manager.strategy=smart
11:46 <@jhf> lol
11:46 <@jhf> that's kinda funny
11:47 <@jhf> you want smart? or liferay?
11:47 <@rotty3000> and there are different problems in both cases
11:47 <@rotty3000> haha
11:47 <@rotty3000> yeah, I didn't come up with the names..
11:47 <@rotty3000> but yeah, I hear ya
11:47 <@jhf> so why does none of this happen with tomcat?
11:48 <@rotty3000> I believe the bug is actually in the jacax.servlet.jsp implementatin jar
11:48 <@rotty3000> javax.servlet.jsp
11:48 <@rotty3000> it holds a constant:             org.apache.jasper.Constants.IS_SECURITY_ENABLED
11:48 <@rotty3000> it's set like so:           public static final boolean IS_SECURITY_ENABLED = (System.getSecurityManager() != null);
11:49 <@rotty3000> that means, it's set once.. and once only for the whole JVM
11:49 <@rotty3000> what that means is that security CANNOT be dynamically enabled
11:50 <@rotty3000> if it doesn't happen before this constant is set.. you're in trouble
11:50 <@rotty3000> because this controls all the JSP handling everywhere in the server
11:50 <@rotty3000> which explains why even the admin app was breaking
11:50 <@rotty3000> security was enabled, BUT this jar didn't think so, and so wasn't creating the JSP classloaders properly
11:51 <@rotty3000> and was breaking in all the permission checks
11:51 <@rotty3000> and giving us those bloody first hit errors
11:51 <@rotty3000> those were first init of our app's jsp classloader
11:52 <@rotty3000> it really is a bug in the jsp refrence impl
11:52 <@rotty3000> it's totally stupid for it to hold a global constant like this
11:52 <@rotty3000> the security API CLEARLY demonstrates that security can be dynamically enabled
11:52 <@rotty3000> it's not a hack to do so
11:53 <@rotty3000> so whichever app server uses the reference implementation of javax.servlet.jsp will likely suffer the same limitation :(
11:54 <@rotty3000> I think tomcat has their own impl, of which the reference was a fork
11:54 <@rotty3000> and so theirs might not hold this global constant
11:54 <@rotty3000> haven't checked yet
11:54 <@rotty3000> make sense?
11:55 <@rotty3000> I haven't filled a bug yet
11:55 <@rotty3000> jhf: do you have any insiders at the JCP who work on this implementation?
11:55 <@jhf> reading...
11:56 <@rotty3000> yeah, it is nausiatingly boring topic I know..
11:56 <@jhf> so
11:56 <@jhf> why does it not happen on second run? if its an in-memory setting
11:57 <@rotty3000> because the jsp init already failed
11:57 <@rotty3000> oh, you mean on the next startup?
11:57 <@jhf> yeah
11:57 <@jhf> everything seems to "just work" for me on second startup
11:57 <@rotty3000> that I'm not sure, but I think it's effectively a race condition with "which apps start first"
11:58 <@rotty3000> the second time, Liferay may be starting before anyone else gets a chance to set the constant.. and by that time, the security is already enabled
11:58 <@rotty3000> note, you don't have security enabled at all yet.. since you are using "smart"
11:58 <@jhf> well it certainly sounds plausible - variable set once that should be dynamic.
11:59 <@rotty3000> and so security never actually kicked in
11:59 <@rotty3000> to cause the utter failure
11:59 <@rotty3000> however, the first time a plugin with PACL would be deployed ... well... BOOM!
11:59 <@rotty3000> every app on the app server would fail
12:00 <@rotty3000> not a nice scenario
12:00 <@jhf> nope. btw this was reported https://java.net/jira/browse/GLASSFISH-19064 I commented on it too
12:00 <@jhf> you may want to provide this add'l clarity
12:00 <@jhf> I have glass fish insider access, but not JCP
12:00 <@rotty3000> the different between "smart" and "liferay" is that "smart" waits for the first PACL plugin to register the SecurityManager
12:00 <@rotty3000> "liferay" does it right away
12:01 <@jhf> is there a way to force it via the jvm cmd line / system property / policy ?
12:01 <@jhf> so it's enabled straight away
12:01 <@rotty3000> oh yes
12:01 <@jhf> and does that make everything work ?
12:01 <@rotty3000> we can default the bundle to security on
12:01 <@rotty3000> yeah, with some policy setting updates
12:01 <@rotty3000> I'm working on that right now
12:02 <@rotty3000> in fact, I think I just finished
12:02 <@rotty3000> portal just came up properly
12:03 <@jhf> ok.. so this wasn't an issue in ga2, becauseâ€¦. ?
12:03 <@rotty3000> WOOHOO, admin app also working
12:03 <@jhf> \o/
12:03 <@jhf> too bad darkos isn't around
12:03 <@jhf> maybe he'll see this in the log
12:04 <@rotty3000> the change required is only in the bundle creation
12:05 <@rotty3000> OR , I guess if you are deploying to an existing GF install
12:05 <@jhf> yeah..
12:05 <@jhf> only if you intend to deploy pack-enabled plugins?
12:05 <@jhf> or is this required even without pacl?
12:06 <@rotty3000> https://gist.github.com/rotty3000/6251182
12:06 <@rotty3000> let me see what happens when I revert this, and set PACL to none, it should all work
12:06 <@rotty3000> actually "default"
12:07 <@rotty3000> it you never plan to enable PACL, you should set       portal.security.manager.strategy=default
12:07 <@rotty3000> oops gist is incorrect
12:08 <@rotty3000> refresh, now it's right
12:08 <@rotty3000> if you plan to use pacl, or want to leave it so that Liferay can enable PACL dynamically later, these are required
12:08 <@rotty3000> all to get around the bug in javax.servlet.jsp
12:11 <@rotty3000> I think the reason we are seeing this how is because of how Liferay is creating the SecurityManager
12:12 <@jhf> ok this all belongs in the glass fish section of the official docs! and modifying our bundles as necessary.
12:12 <@rotty3000> we used to only create the SecurityManager at the time we want to set it, in "smart" mode, this meant we did not set it until the time a plugin was deployed
12:12 <@rotty3000> however, now we create the SecurityManager right away... AND in case of "smart", we only "set" it later as the system securitymanager
12:23 <@jhf> btw, will this be an issue with CE GA3 as well?
12:24 <@jhf> oh also - is the PACL generator in CE GA3?
12:25 <@rotty3000> pacl generator is in every version of Liferay since EE GA2, with updates and bug fixes along the way
12:25 <@rotty3000> so far every version of Liferay has identical PACL impls
12:25 <@jhf> \o/
12:25 <@rotty3000> both 6.1 CE/EE and 6.2
12:46 < jardineworks> hey guys -- do you know if it is possible to detect the omniAdmin in a CAS hook?
13:00 <@jhf> jardineworks: should be! I think there's an isOmniAdmin() API somewhere accessible from hooks
13:00 <@jhf> checking
13:01 <@jhf> oh wait
13:01 <@jhf> which user?
13:01 <@jhf> for example, for 'model listener' hooks - they run independent of any particular user
13:01 <@jhf> there's no request/response with which you can figure out which user 'triggered' the hook
13:02 <@jhf> since hooks can be triggered outside of requests
13:02 <@jhf> are you referring to an autologin hook?
13:02 <@jhf> or a generic hook
13:05 <@jhf> here's an example of "OmniadminUtil.isOmniadmin(userId);": https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/blob/master/portal-impl/src/com/liferay/portal/security/auth/LDAPAuth.java#L504
13:05 <@jhf> thats from the ldap auth "hook" - cas would be similar
13:05 <@jhf> or the same :)
13:05 < jardineworks> jhf, Generic I think. I mean it is not an auto login hook, that's for sure. Basically what I am doing is hooking in and making a REST call to a client api. The authentication is done there and I bypass all checks, include the LR password check. However, I don't want to have to check for the admin in the client rest service.
13:05 <@jhf> if you know which user you want to check, then see above
13:06 < jardineworks> jhf, but I don't think I have a user id... OH WAIT... so I know for example user id = 100 ... so if I use that check it will check the username and pass for user id 100 in lr?
13:07 < jardineworks> and I can use that to short circuit calls to the rest stuff
13:07 <@jhf> it will simply tell you if the user with userId "100" has "OmniAdmin" privileges
13:07 <@jhf> it does not use or require any passwords
13:07 < jardineworks> see I think that is the rub
13:07 < jardineworks> I have an email and password. I don't have a user id
13:07 <@jhf> ah
13:07 <@jhf> you can get the userid easily
13:07 < jardineworks> and I don't look the user up in LR
13:07 < jardineworks> but I suppose I could :)
13:07 <@jhf> UserLocalServiceUtil.getUserByEmailAddress(addr)
13:08 <@jhf> that gives you a User entity
13:08 < jardineworks> right.
13:08 <@jhf> then you can call .getUserId() or just pass the user entity to isOmniAdmin (I think it accepts a User too, would have to check)
13:08 <@jhf> yeah it does
13:08 <@jhf> it's in that LDAPAuth example
13:08 < jardineworks> but noramlly I just go straight to the service. So this way I would do the user lookup, check for omni, if yes let them in, else do the rest stuff
13:09 <@jhf> well your business logic is up to you :) (I still don't quite understand what you're trying to do)
13:09 <@jhf> but thats how you can tell if user X is an omni admin, from java code in a hook in liferay
13:12 < jardineworks> jhf, Sorry I know I am all over the place haha... Ok. User enters the normal username and passsword. THe client wants authentication to be done against their REST api, not the LR database. So I wrote a hook that takes calls their api. The api responds with a token that I use for all subsequent calls to the API. Now, if I am the admin user, the omni I mean, I don't have an account at the client (not sure why). But I still need to
13:12 < jardineworks> access the portal.
13:12 < jardineworks> really, I think they should just add the admin to their user accounts.
13:12 < jardineworks> feels less kludgy
13:12 < jardineworks> I think I'll push for that.
13:12 <@jhf> ahh i see
13:13 <@jhf> so you have passwords stored in LR still though, for each user, right? identical (hopefully) to the ones on the client's auth system?
13:14 < jardineworks> yeah but I use the auth.pipeline.enable.liferay.check=false to bypass the password checks for LR
13:14 <@jhf> ah.. so if you're omni admin, what are you gonna do - just let you in with no password?
13:14 < jardineworks> I tried to get them to set up an LDAP
13:14 < jardineworks> but they're a PHP shop -- guess that is too complicated for them :)
13:16 < jardineworks> well, I am going to push them to add the admin to the list of users on their side. The token comes back and we track it as a [Client]Session using service builder stuff. In order for some of the portlets to work, I need to send the token back with subsequent calls. If I use an omniadmin and bypass the rest login then I won't have a token and the portlets won't work.
13:16 <@jhf> yup, that sounds bad.. in the past, when I've done something like this with opensso (which similarly makes auth REST calls out, and then logs you into LR automagically) we always had an admin account
13:17 < jardineworks> but -- opensso has a shared session for all logins. So when you SSO Logout, you kill all your sessions under the same IdP. In this case if I am logged in on my phone and my laptop I have two separate sessions that are linked. I can log out of my phone and my laptop remains active.
13:17 < jardineworks> at least I think that is what they are doing
13:18 <@jhf> ah
13:18 <@jhf> yeah that sounds awesome
13:18 <@jhf> I can do that with skype
13:18 < jardineworks> awesome for me because I don'
13:18 <@jhf> which is very useful
13:18 < jardineworks> t have to link the sessions and make sure the carts are syched :)
13:18 < jardineworks> shitty for them -- they do :D
13:19 <@jhf> yeah, true!
13:19 <@jhf> hahaha
13:25 <@rotty3000> jhf, is there a ticket for the GF bundle bug?
13:25 <@jhf> there are two
13:25 <@jhf> one for security, one for admin console
13:25 <@jhf> I shall retrieve both now. standby.
13:26 <@rotty3000> thx
13:26 <@jhf> securirt: http://issues.liferay.com/browse/LPS-39095
13:26 <@jhf> admion console: http://issues.liferay.com/browse/LPS-38988
13:26 <@jhf> wow I fat-fingered both of those
13:26 <@jhf> (well the URLs are right)
13:27 <@rotty3000> :) thx
13:27 <@jhf> actually one sec
13:27 <@jhf> for the security bug. I think there's a DUP that was filed way earlier
13:27 <@jhf> lemme find it and DUP this one against that.
13:27 <@jhf> yeah
13:27 <@jhf> http://issues.liferay.com/browse/LPS-33917
13:27 <@jhf> Igor filed and closed it as "a glass fish bug"
13:28 <@jhf> so if you can, either use mine or Igor's, up to you, but one should be DUP'd against the other.
13:30 <@rotty3000> k
13:52 < jardineworks> hey guys -- I'm trying to do something tricky :). I have overridden the view.jsp for the control_panel_menu portlet and forced in a new section with my clients name... lets call it ClientX
13:52 < jardineworks> I have modified my control panel portlet for their settings by adding it to the category
13:53 < jardineworks> both name and category display (yay!)
13:53 < jardineworks> however -- portlet conetent does not display because it says that I do not have permission to access this application (despite the fact that I am logged in as the highest level portal admin)
13:57 <@rotty3000> jardineworks: you need a control panel entry
13:58 <@rotty3000> jardineworks: check the liferay-portlet.xml DTD
13:59 <@rotty3000> it may also be something to do with category permissions
14:01 < jardineworks> rotty3000, I have the control panel entry because I see my portlet under the category on the left.
14:02 < jardineworks> rotty3000, category permissions makes sense... though I thought at the root guy it would let me see it all.
14:03 <@rotty3000> jardineworks: well, in a idea world. I'll look at the code if I get a chance in a bit
14:03 <@rotty3000> s/idea/ideal/
14:04 < jardineworks> rotty3000, ok thanks... I'll keep poking along, let me know when you have time. Thanks.
15:49 <@jhf> hey rotty3000
15:50 <@jhf> quick question: suppose I want to create some custom fields for users, some of which contain sensitive data (e.g. a U.S. social security number).  Can I create the field in such a way that only certain users assigned to a role (e.g. "HR Manager") can see the values for a given user, but other ordinary users cannot?
