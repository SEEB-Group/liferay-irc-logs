05:23 < Axxell:#liferay> hey guys a more or less stupid question again: Liferay.PortletURL.createRenderURL only creates the URI not the URL it seems.. how do i create the full url?
06:28 < Axxell:#liferay> sry got my terms wrong i cant get the URL just the URN
11:08 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, I need the velocity master when he has a minute
11:09 <@jhf:#liferay> ok, go for it
11:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, do you know if there was a problem with one of the the $request object in journal templates in 6.1.2?
11:09 <@jhf:#liferay> there are bugs, yes, but not sure what you're referring to :)
11:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> this is not working for me -- #set ($layoutId = $request.get("theme-display").get("plid"))
11:09 <@jhf:#liferay> the request object is really just a hashmap
11:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> I think my request object is showing {}
11:10 <@jhf:#liferay> btw, you can just say $request.theme-display.plid
11:10 <@jhf:#liferay> (assuming plid is right - i'll check if it works for me)
11:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> request for me is returning {} in the journal templates
11:11 <@jhf:#liferay> hmm.. can you un-check the "cacheable' option?
11:13 <@jhf:#liferay> works for me with 6.1.2
11:18 < jardineworks:#liferay> just unchecked it... but I guess I have to clear some caches too now?
11:18 <@jhf:#liferay> shouldn't have to.. are you doing anything weird, like trying to embed a web content article in something else?
11:23 <@jhf:#liferay> and does it happen for all templates, or just that one?
