07:41 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey jhf you up and about yet?
08:21 < sl33k:#liferay> hey jardineworks
09:18 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey sl33k
09:55 < sl33k:#liferay> jardineworks: formerly topriddy :)
09:56 < jardineworks:#liferay> why the name change?
09:57 < sl33k:#liferay> trying to stay anonymous, some channels are logged.
09:57 < sl33k:#liferay> former is my brand. ^_^
09:57 < sl33k:#liferay> my boss calls me that :|
10:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> ah
10:22 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> hi there
10:24 < bradley:#liferay> with alloyui how do I load in multiple js files?
10:24 < bijoo_:#liferay> nicolas_FR: Hey there, long time no see; I've been busy.
10:25 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> I'm back with my minified css problem :) More informations : same theme.war is deployed in production and in test. Test and Prod server have the same portal-ext.properties. When using chrome source view, test server serves 1 main.css minified file, when prod server serves all css not minified. If I go in tomcat/temp/../minifier/theme/css, both prod and test server have the main.css file minified.
10:25 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> hi bijoo_ :) look at those fresh news, maybe it will get us more solutions ?
10:26 < bijoo_:#liferay> nicolas_FR: Have you tried testing from other machines?
10:26 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> bijoo_: you mean seeing the page from another computer, like browser cache problem ?
10:27 < bijoo_:#liferay> nicolas_FR: yes, to eliminate that as issue.
10:27 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> just did it, same thing
10:28 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> bijoo_: btw you can try, just visit www.interiale.fr and look at sources tab in chrome dev tools
10:29 < bijoo_:#liferay> nicolas_FR: unminified js and css
10:29 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> indeed
10:29 < bijoo_:#liferay> nicolas_FR: something is wrong altogether it seems: https://www.interiale.fr/home?css_fast_load=1&js_fast_load=1
10:30 < bijoo_:#liferay> nicolas_FR: that should minify it whatsoever
10:30 < bijoo_:#liferay> nicolas_FR: did you say you have access to the logs
10:30 < bijoo_:#liferay> ?
10:31 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> bijoo_: yes I have access to the logs
10:31 < bijoo_:#liferay> nicolas_FR: post the last 1000 lines on pastebin.
10:32 < bijoo_:#liferay> tail -n 1000 > /tmp/catalina.t1000.out
10:32 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> bijoo_: just wondering... in the tomcat/temp/minify folder, you have all projects which require minify
10:32 < bijoo_:#liferay> tail -n 1000 catalina.out > /tmp/catalina.t1000.out
10:32 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> the name of the projects I see there should be what ? the <theme id="interiale-theme" name="Interiale Theme"> from liferay-look-and-feel.xml ?
10:33 < bijoo_:#liferay> nicolas_FR: hmm 5.2.3 setup is different than mine
10:33 < bijoo_:#liferay> nicolas_FR: I can check though, it may take time
10:33 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> because I think I don't have the theme folder in minify in the prod server
10:34 < bijoo_:#liferay> nicolas_FR: shouldn't need to manually; post logs.
10:34 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> so logs from now from prod server ?
10:34 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> prod has busy logs
10:35 < bijoo_:#liferay> nicolas_FR: well, anywhere where it won't work correct; try to avoid Prod if you can my friend.
10:36 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> bijoo_: well.. it's only not working on the prod... :) damn me. And, beside greping the tail from logs, you won't find anything in all the logs the prod is writing
10:37 < bijoo_:#liferay> nicolas_FR: I'll be back in a couple of hours.
10:37 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> ok
11:30 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Hey guys.
11:30 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Is is possible to restrict access to the documents library folders for different roles?
11:30 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I want certain roles to only be able to upload into certain folders.
12:39 < bijoo_:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur: yes, have you seen set permissions for roles?
12:40 < bijoo_:#liferay> nicolas_FR: I'm back; did you post the log files here?
12:40 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> bijoo_: I just found out that permissions per folder apparently were introduced in 6.1.2
