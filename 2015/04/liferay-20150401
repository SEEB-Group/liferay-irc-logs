09:00 < jardineworks:#liferay> good morning guys
09:00 < jardineworks:#liferay> does anyone know if tags assigned to web content are supposed to be indexed?
10:58 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey topolik -- you around for a question?
12:18 -!- mode/#liferay [+o jhf] by ChanServ
14:07 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, are you tres busy at the moment?
14:07 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah - we just did a new CE release https://www.liferay.com/web/james.falkner/blog/-/blogs/liferay-portal-6-3a-released-
14:07 <@jhf:#liferay> getting lots of interest
14:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, ah ok
14:20 <@jhf:#liferay> jardineworks: clearly you have not read the release details
14:21 <@jhf:#liferay> you better check it out! important details for you and your clients.
14:45 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, I have not! really? do you have a llink handy?
14:45 <@jhf:#liferay> jardineworks: https://www.liferay.com/web/james.falkner/blog/-/blogs/liferay-portal-6-3a-released-
14:47 < jardineworks:#liferay> april fools
14:47 < jardineworks:#liferay> please tell me -- its april fools
14:48 < jardineworks:#liferay> LOL
14:48 < jardineworks:#liferay> best blog post ever
14:48 < jardineworks:#liferay> "A valid credit card is now required to activate your installation. We may share this information with our advertising "partners"."
14:48 < jardineworks:#liferay> I like that one jhf
14:49 <@jhf:#liferay> :)
14:49 <@jhf:#liferay> so to answer your original question - not super busy today :)
14:49 < jardineworks:#liferay> wait -- does that mean that you're NOT actually busy and you can noodle something with me? lol
14:49 <@jhf:#liferay> have one meeting in 70 minutes
14:49 <@jhf:#liferay> I can for a little bit. I mean I have stuff to do. just nothing urgently due TODAY.
14:49 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, ok -- do you remember my multi-domain problem?
14:50 <@jhf:#liferay> heh.. ummmmmm... I don't think so. the last thing I remember was the locale thing
14:50 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, sort of
14:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, refresher. Client has multiple hosts that you need to point to a single company.
14:51 <@jhf:#liferay> you mean multiple hostnames? like host1.company.com and host2.company.com that should point to a single company in Liferay?
14:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, So originally I was looking at EXT plugging that to support a locale + host + company id approach, but it's freakin' bananas -- so we're going a much simpler route.
14:52 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, yeah, and they're not even close. Like businesscenter and carrefourdaffaires.
14:52 < jardineworks:#liferay> same company
14:52 < jardineworks:#liferay> so the current way liferay does it is a bust for them
14:52 < jardineworks:#liferay> they're doing it anyway, but they broke the constraint on the virtualhost table and are manually adding secondary records with the same company id
14:53 < jardineworks:#liferay> Lotsa problems with staging, no proof, but likely related.
14:53 < jardineworks:#liferay> ANYWAY!
14:53 < jardineworks:#liferay> ... solution time.
14:54 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, What I have propose (and we're working on) is simple. Use the property to retrieve the language from the HTTP Request header (accept-language). On the way in, for say french.external.com .. change the host in the header to internal.com, and set the language to french. For english go from english.external.com to internal.com and set the header to english
14:54 < jardineworks:#liferay> easy peasy... that works.
14:54 < jardineworks:#liferay> On the way out -- here is the tricky bit
14:55 < jardineworks:#liferay> we're using an F5 which has a nifty STREAM:: feature. It allows you to string replace.
14:55 < jardineworks:#liferay> so we look for internal.com and replace with either french.external,com or english.external,.com -- depending on te GUEST_LANGUAGE_ID cookie value.
14:55 < jardineworks:#liferay> the odd thing
14:56 < jardineworks:#liferay> SOME stuff in the page is replace.
14:56 < jardineworks:#liferay> some is not.
14:56 < jardineworks:#liferay> those that are not appear to be PORTLET stuff.
14:56 < jardineworks:#liferay> so for example, the header image? changes. The forgot password link? no change.
14:57 <@jhf:#liferay> are those links prefixed with the hostname?
14:57 <@jhf:#liferay> (in the HTML going back to the client side)
14:57 < jardineworks:#liferay> I checked the source and I can see <portlet:actionURL/> or <portlet:renderURL/> tags -- and when i trace them back I get all the way to the PortalImpl class -- getPortalURL method
14:57 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, when I look at any of the source in the page, all links have hosts in them. None of them are relative.
14:58 <@jhf:#liferay> ok is it a bug in the F5 STREAM:: thingy that it's not properly rewriting the URLs ?
14:58 <@jhf:#liferay> maybe I don't get what you're doing, but it sounds like you've got a load balancer that is supposed to be rewriting URLs in the outgoing html?
14:59 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, exactly
14:59 < jardineworks:#liferay> but I don't think it is a bug because some of them are being rewritten
15:00 < jardineworks:#liferay> I guess I just wasn't sure if there was something special about portlet urls vs "portal" urls.
15:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> but when I load the home page... all the source for the page, meaning the markup for the portlets and everything, -- that's all part of ONE request right?
15:02 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, do you know if there is a class where I can set a breakpoint to see the full response body BEFORE it is written to the proxy?
15:02 <@jhf:#liferay> yep it should be 1 request. I don't think we do any automatic ajaxification of portlet content
15:02 <@jhf:#liferay> I would add a new servlet filter that is at the end of the processing chain but I'm not sure where that end of chain is.
15:03 <@jhf:#liferay> you could also set a breakpoint in that final filter if you knew which final filter it was
15:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> hmmm.. maybe a service.post hook?
15:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> those are run last -- at the end of a request right?
15:05 <@jhf:#liferay> oh yeah
15:05 <@jhf:#liferay> that's a good place.
15:06 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, or maybe soemwhere in the MainServlet?
15:07 <@jhf:#liferay> can you use your browser to access the node directly and bypass the F5?
15:07 <@jhf:#liferay> and see what the browser sees
15:07 <@jhf:#liferay> using IP address
15:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> I can
15:13 < jardineworks:#liferay> lemme and I think it returns the "full url" for all the links -- but I have done so many things I can't recall. Lemme try again.
15:14 < jardineworks:#liferay> yeah -- all links have the same host/port.
15:14 < jardineworks:#liferay> so it seems like the f5 is doing some by not all. hmmmm I wonder why.
15:16 <@jhf:#liferay> are you sure? can you use a command line tool like curl to ensure the returned html really does have the absolute URLs and
15:16 <@jhf:#liferay> that your browser isn't doing something magical?
15:18 < jardineworks:#liferay> well, I can.. but the thing is, the browser doesn't know about the internal.com. So that means, in my mind, that the internal.com text in the page, must be coming from someone who knows about it... ie. the Liferay server.
15:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> what a second
15:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> its even stranger
15:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, get this. If I HOVER on a link, I see ... internal.com/ .. if I VIEW SOURCE for the page, then I see all the links are correct :S
15:22 < jardineworks:#liferay> w ... t.... f.
15:22 < jardineworks:#liferay> If I use Chrome inspector... then the HTML shows the hover values.
15:22 < jardineworks:#liferay> :S
15:23 <@jhf:#liferay> ummm
15:23 <@jhf:#liferay> are there any odd headers being sent back to the client? like is the Host: header set to what you would expect?
15:25 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, my undertanding is that there is no HOST header attribute for a response
15:26 <@jhf:#liferay> ok I am not an web-expert so you are undoubtedly correct :) I just thought maybe Liferay or you were setting a header that the browser was using to do some magical rewriting internally
15:26 <@jhf:#liferay> but if you use curl you see the full URLs that are supposed to be being re-written?
15:27 <@jhf:#liferay> can you turn off the F5 editing thingy and verify all the URLs are proper (and the same - i.e. internal.com ?)
16:59 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, I am going to try something that is probably terrible using an EXT plugin. I'm going to alter the HtmlImpl.escapeJS method to do nothing and see what that does.
17:03 <@jhf:#liferay> hahahaha well I mean it's a good thing to try, just to verify your hypothesis
17:03 <@jhf:#liferay> I would avoid going into production with that, though :)
17:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> well.. I am between a rock and a hard place right now
17:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> assuming the f5 can actually unescape stuff, I imagine that would make a mess of anything not escaped but containing such characters
17:07 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, so I guess we're stuck with the "work around" ... and I'll be forking Liferay to make a pretty outrageous change to it and hoping you guys accept it.
17:09 <@jhf:#liferay> so just so I'm clear - your client wants to be able to use the domain name to specify which language they want content in. so they want to be able to go to french.company.com and english.company.com. Why can't you just say "too bad, you have to go to company.com/fr or company.com/en" ?
17:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, lol
17:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, you are obviously not educated on the politics of english in the province of Quebec.
17:10 <@jhf:#liferay> they like "vanity URLs" that much eh :) or let their browser tell (via accept-languages)!
17:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> we are using the accept languages now... for guest users of course.
17:10 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah..
17:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> but they want entirely different domains.
17:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> no sharesies.
17:10 <@jhf:#liferay> hahaha
17:11 <@jhf:#liferay> all pointing to the same LR instance
17:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> some claim its a gap in Liferay.. I challenged to show me another portal in the market that has this -- pretty sure none do because this is only really a problem in QC.
17:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> its unfortunate.
17:13 < jardineworks:#liferay> so now the challenges is changing the VirtualHost table to include a locale ... and all references to include a locale in the lookup.
17:13 < jardineworks:#liferay> bigger challenge is making sure that everywhere it is used, the locale is present S:
17:13 < jardineworks:#liferay> I smell a thread local coming on.
17:14 < jardineworks:#liferay> but then new threads that are spawned would also need this :S
17:14 < jardineworks:#liferay> kill me.
17:14 <@jhf:#liferay> can you use two different sites (on a single company/instance)?
17:15 < jardineworks:#liferay> nope.. company nad virtual host are a one to one.
17:15 < jardineworks:#liferay> additional sites won't get me any closer
17:16 <@jhf:#liferay> but but
17:16 <@jhf:#liferay> can't each site have its own virtual host name?
17:16 < jardineworks:#liferay> hmmm
17:16 < jardineworks:#liferay> yes, BUT
17:16 < jardineworks:#liferay> then you get into the problem of content
17:16 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah
17:17 < jardineworks:#liferay> either you duplicate it, or you put it in a parent site.
17:17 < jardineworks:#liferay> both are gross.
17:17 <@jhf:#liferay> even with content in a parent site you still need duplicate stuff
17:17 <@jhf:#liferay> layouts, layoutsets, categories/tags, etc
17:18 <@jhf:#liferay> this sounds like an awesome feature for Quebec
17:18 <@jhf:#liferay> we could take over the province with this feature
17:19 <@jhf:#liferay> your F5 rewriter solution sounds fragile and bound to miss stuff (e.g. from the encoded URLs any any dynamic content that is added via javascript)
17:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> yeah I know
17:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> but
17:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> it would save changing the 207 JSPs, for example, that reference the company via virtual host.
17:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> :)
17:21 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah
17:22 <@jhf:#liferay> also I assume you've seen and dismissed http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24705739/liferay-translation-depending-on-url
17:22 <@jhf:#liferay> basically force-redireting french.company.com to company.com/fr
17:25 < jardineworks:#liferay> we did that
17:25 < jardineworks:#liferay> BUT
17:25 < jardineworks:#liferay> then Liferay writes all the urls in the page as company.com/fr
17:25 < jardineworks:#liferay> so in your browser for the result you start seeing company.com/fr
17:25 < jardineworks:#liferay> which, if you are a staunch Francophone and proud of your language etc. will really piss you off.
17:26 < jardineworks:#liferay> It basically looks like you are discarding the french version of the domain.
17:26 <@jhf:#liferay> hahaha I see
17:26 < jardineworks:#liferay> I wish Liferay had an alias feature.
17:26 < jardineworks:#liferay> hmmm
17:26 <@jhf:#liferay> tell them that pretty soon the address bar is going to be removed from browsers!
17:26 < jardineworks:#liferay> lol
17:26 <@jhf:#liferay> no one types in double-u double-u double-u dot anymore
17:27 <@jhf:#liferay> they just type their porn queries directly into the search bar at the top of their internet machine
17:27 <@jhf:#liferay> (formerly known as a laptop/tablet/whatever)
17:27 < jardineworks:#liferay> lol
17:28 < jardineworks:#liferay> ok.. why the &$(@! is it called a "double-u" anyway, when CLEARLY it is a double-V  w
17:28 <@jhf:#liferay> hahaha
17:28 < jardineworks:#liferay> ... U's AREN'T POINTY!
17:28 <@jhf:#liferay> is't it double-V in french
17:28 <@jhf:#liferay> dooobla veigh
17:28 < jardineworks:#liferay> in every other language in the world its called a double V.
17:28 < jardineworks:#liferay> totally.
17:28 < jardineworks:#liferay> lol
17:29 < jardineworks:#liferay> so...
17:29 <@jhf:#liferay> have you asked Dr. Sbaitso ?
17:29 < jardineworks:#liferay> how does Liferay deal with this situtation for other clients?
17:29 <@jhf:#liferay> with redirects most likely (I don't know for sure; not aware of any clients with this need)
17:30 <@jhf:#liferay> that's the job of the i18nServlet I think
17:30 < jardineworks:#liferay> but my issue is not about the way in... I can take care of that already. Its the way out and subsequent ways in with the results that are the issue
17:31 < jardineworks:#liferay> ok -- how about this
17:33 < jardineworks:#liferay> A new SB plugin that has VirtualHost aliases. In there you can create as many hosts as you want .. and you need to define a way to identify it. So, for example, internal.com/fr ---> french.external.com. Then in the PortalImpl.getPortalURL, check for a property to say whether or not aliases are enabled. If they are, then return the alias.
17:34 <@jhf:#liferay> ... assuming that getPortalURL is used in all cases
17:34 < jardineworks:#liferay> true -- PortalUtil though..
17:34 <@jhf:#liferay> it sounds good in theory though.
17:35 <@jhf:#liferay> you could easily prototype that though
17:35 <@jhf:#liferay> just fork the right liferay version, edit that code, re-build portal-impl.jar and copy it on top of your regular ojne
17:36 < jardineworks:#liferay> we're EE clients :)
17:36 < jardineworks:#liferay> oh --
17:36 < jardineworks:#liferay> but i have the EE source -- duh
17:36 < jardineworks:#liferay> lol
17:36 < jardineworks:#liferay> I think it's getting late for me. long day.
17:37 < jardineworks:#liferay> so... then we would have
17:37 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah you have the EE source - but not the build scripts. I would prototype it with CE.
17:37 < jardineworks:#liferay> french.external.com ---> proxy ---> internal.com/fr ... but all urls going out would alias to french.external.com
17:37 < jardineworks:#liferay> hmm
17:37 < jardineworks:#liferay> one more problem
17:37 <@jhf:#liferay> right. that's what you're attempting wiht the F5 thing now right?
17:38 < jardineworks:#liferay> if you set the url local display style property = 2 ... then LR will add the language for you
17:38 < jardineworks:#liferay> so the /fr is auto-prepended.
17:38 < jardineworks:#liferay> BUT
17:38 < jardineworks:#liferay> it does it as part of a 302.
17:38 < jardineworks:#liferay> so I guess your proxy would need to have a redirect for the internal domain as well.
17:39 < jardineworks:#liferay> we have the way in with the f5 working like gold.
17:39 < jardineworks:#liferay> it's just a handful of wrong urls in the response body that are ruining my sleep.
17:41 <@jhf:#liferay> I still don't get how they are "hoverable" URLs.. the only URLs that would appear to be escaped are those embedded in executable javascript. all the URLs that a browser "sees" (and are therefore hoverable) should have first been seen by your F5 shenanigans
17:41 <@jhf:#liferay> unless they are URLs written after the html was delivered, via javascript
17:42 < jardineworks:#liferay> well -- it looks like these are "urls" but they are in the JS and in the JS they have been escaped. So they have all those \x2f and stuff... which the STREAM:: operation doesn't match on, so it just sneaks on by
17:43 <@jhf:#liferay> right
17:43 <@jhf:#liferay> BUT
17:43 <@jhf:#liferay> they shouldn't be "hoverable"/clickable URLs.. that is, the href in the <a> tags shouldn't contain escaped URLs
17:44 < jardineworks:#liferay> ah
