14:47 < jardineworks:#liferay> april fools
14:47 < jardineworks:#liferay> please tell me -- its april fools
14:48 < jardineworks:#liferay> LOL
14:48 < jardineworks:#liferay> best blog post ever
14:48 < jardineworks:#liferay> "A valid credit card is now required to activate your installation. We may share this information with our advertising "partners"."
14:48 < jardineworks:#liferay> I like that one jhf
14:49 <@jhf:#liferay> :)
14:49 <@jhf:#liferay> so to answer your original question - not super busy today :)
14:49 < jardineworks:#liferay> wait -- does that mean that you're NOT actually busy and you can noodle something with me? lol
14:49 <@jhf:#liferay> have one meeting in 70 minutes
14:49 <@jhf:#liferay> I can for a little bit. I mean I have stuff to do. just nothing urgently due TODAY.
14:49 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, ok -- do you remember my multi-domain problem?
14:50 <@jhf:#liferay> heh.. ummmmmm... I don't think so. the last thing I remember was the locale thing
14:50 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, sort of
14:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, refresher. Client has multiple hosts that you need to point to a single company.
14:51 <@jhf:#liferay> you mean multiple hostnames? like host1.company.com and host2.company.com that should point to a single company in Liferay?
14:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, So originally I was looking at EXT plugging that to support a locale + host + company id approach, but it's freakin' bananas -- so we're going a much simpler route.
