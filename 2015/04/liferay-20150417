07:36 < jardineworks:#liferay> plekplek, ping me when you are around
07:37 < plekplek:#liferay> jardineworks, hey
07:38 < jardineworks:#liferay> plekplek, lol - damit you weren't supposed to answer until 8:30 or 9 EST
07:38 < plekplek:#liferay> haha
07:39 < jardineworks:#liferay> just eating breakfast with my son but when he is off to school I have some questions about the hook you wrote ... save me doing the digging since you already did it :)
07:39 < plekplek:#liferay> i never sleep
07:39 < jardineworks:#liferay> my son is turning 5 next month and I am about to have my second (a girl) in about 2 weeks. Sleep is something foreign to me as well -- though not by choice.
