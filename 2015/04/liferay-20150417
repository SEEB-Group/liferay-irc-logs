07:36 < jardineworks:#liferay> plekplek, ping me when you are around
07:37 < plekplek:#liferay> jardineworks, hey
07:38 < jardineworks:#liferay> plekplek, lol - damit you weren't supposed to answer until 8:30 or 9 EST
07:38 < plekplek:#liferay> haha
07:39 < jardineworks:#liferay> just eating breakfast with my son but when he is off to school I have some questions about the hook you wrote ... save me doing the digging since you already did it :)
07:39 < plekplek:#liferay> i never sleep
07:39 < jardineworks:#liferay> my son is turning 5 next month and I am about to have my second (a girl) in about 2 weeks. Sleep is something foreign to me as well -- though not by choice.
07:41 < plekplek:#liferay> hey thatâ€™s wonderful! congratulations! :)
07:44 < plekplek:#liferay> i could believe that the excitement usually makes up for the loss in energy and sleep
09:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> plekplek, 5 minutes

13:37 < winem_:#liferay> congratulations, jardineworks! :)
13:58 < jardineworks:#liferay> winem_, ?
13:59 < winem_:#liferay> yep :)
13:59 < jardineworks:#liferay> thank you?
13:59 < jardineworks:#liferay> what did I win ... I've been away at lunch :)
14:01 < winem_:#liferay> a new child. in 2 weeks ;)
14:02 < jardineworks:#liferay> OH!
14:02 < jardineworks:#liferay> hah
14:02 < jardineworks:#liferay> yeah ... girl this time. And this is the last.
14:02 < jardineworks:#liferay> I can't afford anymore children and we don't have the infrastructure for it
14:04 < winem_:#liferay> that's what colleague also told me a few years ago. the 4th child is the last... he did not know that he'll get three at a time :D
14:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> omg
14:04 < winem_:#liferay> but I think 2 kids are great :)
14:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> i would cry
14:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> apparently there is an expression here in North America that I just learned about... I have a son already (5 next month) and I told someone that we were having a girl this time, and he said "Oh, million dollar family!" ...
14:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> and I thought about it
14:06 < jardineworks:#liferay> and it much be some reference to being lucky... and I guess at one time, a million dollars was a lot of money, and you would be lukcy to have it :)
14:06 < jardineworks:#liferay> they really need to update the expression though
14:06 < winem_:#liferay> interesting :)
14:06 < jardineworks:#liferay> a million dollars doesn't go the same distance these days -- not in Toronto anyway :)
14:07 < winem_:#liferay> yep, I know what you mean.. and I don't like the current us dollar course.. makes my new bike a more expensive.. even if it's manufactured in canda ;(
14:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> bicycle or motor bike?
14:11 < winem_:#liferay> bicycle
14:11 < winem_:#liferay> don't have a driving license, yet... hope to get it this year :)
14:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> what kind of bike?
14:13 < winem_:#liferay> a mountainbike. to be more specific an all-mountain or enduro bike from knolly
14:14 < jardineworks:#liferay> not familiar with that one... I used to do a ton of trail riding in my younger days.
14:14 < jardineworks:#liferay> it was a long time ago though
14:15 < jardineworks:#liferay> I took my bike in to the sop last year and the guy in the shop freaked out .. "omg! A REAL MONGOOSE! When they were still made in North America!"
