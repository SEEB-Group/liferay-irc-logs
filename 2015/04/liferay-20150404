08:49 < winem_:#liferay> Hi together, I'm quite sure that there is some property for the portal-ext.properties to disable the "set new password"-functionality when a user has logged in for the first time. but I can't find it in https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/blob/master/portal-impl/src/portal.properties ... does anyone know the respective property?
