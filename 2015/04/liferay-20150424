05:57 < Soufien:#liferay> hey community
05:58 < Soufien:#liferay> is there any one who can talk with me about liferay ?
05:58 < Soufien:#liferay> i m new in the community
06:00 < Soufien:#liferay> and actually i m doing a research about choosing this platform to build a portal application for a company
06:22 < plekplek:#liferay> Soufien, what kind of application are you planning for?
06:23 < Soufien:#liferay> knowledge share
06:23 < Soufien:#liferay> wiki
06:23 < Soufien:#liferay> document sharing
06:23 < Soufien:#liferay> article sharing
06:23 < Soufien:#liferay> somethings like this
06:31 < Soufien:#liferay> An application where users can request to have an account
06:31 < Soufien:#liferay> share articles and notes, users can comment on articles.
06:31 < Soufien:#liferay> Users can subscribe on comments, on articles …
06:31 < Soufien:#liferay> Users can modify account preferencies...
06:35 < Soufien:#liferay> the important thing on this work is why choosing Liferay to develop this application and not xWiki !! my boss want me to use liferay and want me also to test these two platforms and give arguments why Liferay and not xWiki !!
06:36 < Soufien:#liferay> "Sorry for my bad english"
07:54 < plekplek:#liferay> i don’t have any experience in xwiki, but i think some people are using it inside liferay portal
07:56 < plekplek:#liferay> i think liferay is a larger portal where you can implement enterprise solutions, compared to xwiki, which is more about content sharing. someone correct me if i’m wrong
08:12 < plekplek:#liferay> hufg, did you get the ext-plugin running?
08:12 < hufg:#liferay> yeah there was some trouble with deployment
08:12 < hufg:#liferay> it doesn't copy ext-impl to WEB-inf/lib
08:13 < hufg:#liferay> didn't get jrebel working with it though
08:13 < hufg:#liferay> that shit would be golden
08:15 < plekplek:#liferay> ah yeah, think i had the same problem at some point
08:16 < hufg:#liferay> any ideas why this query works in pure sql and not in hibernate bracket notation ? :D https://gist.github.com/anonymous/675a02755f9357a78652
08:37 < hufg:#liferay> oh hibernate messes up the query
08:38 < hufg:#liferay> how convenient
09:17 < Andrea_:#liferay> Hi all, anyone here?
09:19 < Andrea_:#liferay> No?
09:21 < Andrea_:#liferay> Anyone online?
09:29 < Andrea_:#liferay> hi all
09:38 < andreeww:#liferay> hi
09:38 < andreeww:#liferay> someone here
09:38 < andreeww:#liferay> ?
09:39 < jardineworks:#liferay> hi andreeww
09:39 < jardineworks:#liferay> weird... that is my name :)
09:39 < Andrea_:#liferay> hi
09:40 < andreeww:#liferay> hi jardineworks
09:40 < andreeww:#liferay> I thought i was doing something wrong because no one replied me xD
09:40 < andreeww:#liferay> may i ask you a question about liferay?
09:44 < andreeww:#liferay> I want to hide to users the possibility to edit their user account info. For example : i create a new account then log in with it and from My Account portlet i can modify my first name for example..i would like to avoid this (like the way USER ID is uneditable). How can i achieve this goal?
09:50 < jardineworks:#liferay> andreeww, hmmm gimme a minute to check something
09:53 < jardineworks:#liferay> andreeww, in the control panel > roles .. edit the "User" role
09:54 < jardineworks:#liferay> there will be a tab for define permissions
09:54 < jardineworks:#liferay> and then from the options ont he left expand "My Account"
09:54 < jardineworks:#liferay> choose Account Settings
09:54 < jardineworks:#liferay> and uncheck "Access My Account"
09:54 < jardineworks:#liferay> that might do it for you
09:56 < andreeww:#liferay> i'm going to try this! thanks, will be back soon
10:00 < winem__:#liferay> hey jardine :)
10:00 < winem__:#liferay> sounds interesting but I missed the question / issue
10:01 < andreeww:#liferay> What about if i wanna let the user the permission to edit some fields( street where he lives) but denying the permission to edit some others(life first name)?
10:01 < andreeww:#liferay> like first name*
10:02 < andreeww:#liferay> i'll be back in 10 minute! feel free to reply, i'll read it asap. thank you again
10:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> winem__,  I want to hide to users the possibility to edit their user account info. For example : i create a new account then log in with it and from My Account portlet i can modify my first name for example..i would like to avoid this (like the way USER ID is uneditable). How can i achieve this goal?
10:06 < jardineworks:#liferay> andreeww, hmm... field level stuff I don't think you can do. Let me check the properties file, but I suspect you would need a JSP hook to do that.
10:06 < winem__:#liferay> ok, so it's really an interesting issue. thanks :)
10:06 < jardineworks:#liferay> aw man
10:07 < jardineworks:#liferay> I just found something for him!
10:07 < jardineworks:#liferay>     #
10:07 < jardineworks:#liferay>     # Input a list of sections that will be included as part of the user form
10:07 < jardineworks:#liferay>     # when updating a user in the My Account portlet.
10:07 < jardineworks:#liferay>     #
10:07 < jardineworks:#liferay>     users.form.my.account.main=details,password,organizations,sites,user-groups,roles,categorization
10:07 < jardineworks:#liferay>     users.form.my.account.identification=addresses,phone-numbers,additional-email-addresses,websites,instant-messenger,social-network,sms,open-id
10:07 < jardineworks:#liferay>     users.form.my.account.miscellaneous=announcements,display-settings,comments,custom-fields
10:07 < jardineworks:#liferay> you can remove some of those values whihc will hide the sections
10:28 < Andrea_:#liferay> Hi! i think i disconnected, can you copy paste the reply?
10:29 < Andrea_:#liferay> (I'm andreeww)
