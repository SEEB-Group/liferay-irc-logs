09:32 < Andrea_:#liferay> good morning to everybody
09:39 < twen:#liferay> Good afternoon Andrea_ :)
09:44 < Andrea_:#liferay> I was trying to render First Name field in the my account portlet not editable for the role "user", i created a hook but i don't know where and what i have to modify something, can you help me?
09:49 < jardineworks:#liferay> Andrea_, I can help you but I need 30 minutes first.
09:49 < jardineworks:#liferay> Andrea_, you created a JSP hook right?
09:49 < Andrea_:#liferay> hi jardine , no problem , take your time of course
09:50 < Andrea_:#liferay> yes i created the hook and overridden edit_user.jsp
09:50 < Andrea_:#liferay> well, i just opened it, still did not edited tho..
09:56 < jardineworks:#liferay> Andrea_, ok cool -- have you found the field that you want to disable?
09:57 < Andrea_:#liferay> no, i'm lost in this jsp
10:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> lol
10:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> ok
10:03 < jardineworks:#liferay> Andrea_, Ok -- I'm going teach  you how to find it. Go to your chrome browser and use the inspector to find some html markup that is specific to the field.
10:03 < jardineworks:#liferay> probably a class name of a div id or something
10:04 < Andrea_:#liferay> ok
10:04 < Andrea_:#liferay> its f12 feature right?
10:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> yep
10:05 < Andrea_:#liferay> i'm ready
10:06 < jardineworks:#liferay> ok -- find some markup specific to that field
10:07 < jardineworks:#liferay> whcih field is it you are after again?
10:08 < Andrea_:#liferay> i need to render some fields like screen name/first name etc like User id is shown, not editable
10:09 < Andrea_:#liferay> we can start from first name
10:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> ok so you need to find some markup for the first name
10:10 < Andrea_:#liferay> yes
10:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> find it?
10:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> what did you find?
10:12 < Andrea_:#liferay> <input class="field lfr-input-text" id="_125_firstName" name="_125_firstName" style="max-width: 150px; " type="text" value="test" maxlength="75" aria-required="true">
10:12 < Andrea_:#liferay> i positioned mouse over the field and clicked it and got this
10:14 < jardineworks:#liferay> so do a find in the source code for "firstName"
10:15 < Andrea_:#liferay> i did it, in edit_user.jsp , but there isn't anything like that
10:17 < jardineworks:#liferay> one sec
10:17 < jardineworks:#liferay> right
10:18 < jardineworks:#liferay> this uses a form navigator -- which basically gives you that little menu on the right hand side. The way that works is that each of those links is a separate JSP. In the JSP you're editing you can see this --
10:18 < jardineworks:#liferay> 	<liferay-ui:form-navigator
10:18 < jardineworks:#liferay> 		backURL="<%= backURL %>"
10:18 < jardineworks:#liferay> 		categoryNames="<%= _CATEGORY_NAMES %>"
10:18 < jardineworks:#liferay> 		categorySections="<%= categorySections %>"
10:18 < jardineworks:#liferay> 		htmlBottom="<%= htmlBottom %>"
10:18 < jardineworks:#liferay> 		htmlTop="<%= htmlTop %>"
10:18 < jardineworks:#liferay> 		jspPath="/html/portlet/users_admin/user/"
10:18 < jardineworks:#liferay> 	/>
10:18 < jardineworks:#liferay> so really, you are not editing this jsp... but rather one of the jsps under /html/portlet/users_admin/user
10:19 < Andrea_:#liferay> ok
10:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> check out the details_user_name.jspf
10:20 < Andrea_:#liferay> then i guess the jsp i have to edit is details.jsp?
10:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> in the details_user_name.jspf -- yeah
10:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> which means in your jsp-hook plugin you need to add a user folder and then this file.
