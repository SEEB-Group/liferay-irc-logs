09:32 < Andrea_:#liferay> good morning to everybody
09:39 < twen:#liferay> Good afternoon Andrea_ :)
09:44 < Andrea_:#liferay> I was trying to render First Name field in the my account portlet not editable for the role "user", i created a hook but i don't know where and what i have to modify something, can you help me?
09:49 < jardineworks:#liferay> Andrea_, I can help you but I need 30 minutes first.
09:49 < jardineworks:#liferay> Andrea_, you created a JSP hook right?
09:49 < Andrea_:#liferay> hi jardine , no problem , take your time of course
09:50 < Andrea_:#liferay> yes i created the hook and overridden edit_user.jsp
09:50 < Andrea_:#liferay> well, i just opened it, still did not edited tho..
09:56 < jardineworks:#liferay> Andrea_, ok cool -- have you found the field that you want to disable?
09:57 < Andrea_:#liferay> no, i'm lost in this jsp
10:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> lol
10:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> ok
10:03 < jardineworks:#liferay> Andrea_, Ok -- I'm going teach  you how to find it. Go to your chrome browser and use the inspector to find some html markup that is specific to the field.
10:03 < jardineworks:#liferay> probably a class name of a div id or something
10:04 < Andrea_:#liferay> ok
10:04 < Andrea_:#liferay> its f12 feature right?
10:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> yep
10:05 < Andrea_:#liferay> i'm ready
10:06 < jardineworks:#liferay> ok -- find some markup specific to that field
10:07 < jardineworks:#liferay> whcih field is it you are after again?
10:08 < Andrea_:#liferay> i need to render some fields like screen name/first name etc like User id is shown, not editable
10:09 < Andrea_:#liferay> we can start from first name
10:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> ok so you need to find some markup for the first name
10:10 < Andrea_:#liferay> yes
10:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> find it?
10:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> what did you find?
10:12 < Andrea_:#liferay> <input class="field lfr-input-text" id="_125_firstName" name="_125_firstName" style="max-width: 150px; " type="text" value="test" maxlength="75" aria-required="true">
10:12 < Andrea_:#liferay> i positioned mouse over the field and clicked it and got this
10:14 < jardineworks:#liferay> so do a find in the source code for "firstName"
10:15 < Andrea_:#liferay> i did it, in edit_user.jsp , but there isn't anything like that
10:17 < jardineworks:#liferay> one sec
10:17 < jardineworks:#liferay> right
10:18 < jardineworks:#liferay> this uses a form navigator -- which basically gives you that little menu on the right hand side. The way that works is that each of those links is a separate JSP. In the JSP you're editing you can see this --
10:18 < jardineworks:#liferay> 	<liferay-ui:form-navigator
10:18 < jardineworks:#liferay> 		backURL="<%= backURL %>"
10:18 < jardineworks:#liferay> 		categoryNames="<%= _CATEGORY_NAMES %>"
10:18 < jardineworks:#liferay> 		categorySections="<%= categorySections %>"
10:18 < jardineworks:#liferay> 		htmlBottom="<%= htmlBottom %>"
10:18 < jardineworks:#liferay> 		htmlTop="<%= htmlTop %>"
10:18 < jardineworks:#liferay> 		jspPath="/html/portlet/users_admin/user/"
10:18 < jardineworks:#liferay> 	/>
10:18 < jardineworks:#liferay> so really, you are not editing this jsp... but rather one of the jsps under /html/portlet/users_admin/user
10:19 < Andrea_:#liferay> ok
10:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> check out the details_user_name.jspf
10:20 < Andrea_:#liferay> then i guess the jsp i have to edit is details.jsp?
10:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> in the details_user_name.jspf -- yeah
10:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> which means in your jsp-hook plugin you need to add a user folder and then this file.
10:22 < Andrea_:#liferay> did it.. may i ask you if i can post link to screenshots in this chat?
10:22 < jardineworks:#liferay> sure
10:22 < jardineworks:#liferay> as long as you don't care about others seeing it
10:23 < Andrea_:#liferay> http://gyazo.com/66a24f371fd82281404ed8eac0d3e722
10:23 < jardineworks:#liferay> bah that site wants me to create an account --
10:24 < jardineworks:#liferay> can you use another site that is free :)
10:24 < Andrea_:#liferay> ok sorry did not know
10:25 < Andrea_:#liferay> its strange, can u test this ? http://i.gyazo.com/66a24f371fd82281404ed8eac0d3e722.png
10:26 < jardineworks:#liferay> no worries -- just can't be bothered to sign up when there are so many free ones out there. I already have a million accounts I have forgotten I created :)
10:26 < jardineworks:#liferay> see it
10:26 < Andrea_:#liferay> nice i copied the wrong link sorry
10:26 < jardineworks:#liferay> ok -- but I don't think that will work. JSP hooks work on the premise that the name of the file you are hooking is IDENTICAL in your project with the one on the server.
10:27 < jardineworks:#liferay> the firstName field is not in the details.jsp
10:27 < jardineworks:#liferay> it is in the details_user_name.jspf
10:29 < Andrea_:#liferay> right..added it to the project
10:29 < Andrea_:#liferay> sorry i'm a total newbee
10:30 < jardineworks:#liferay> ok -- it's ok, I remember. :)
10:30 < jardineworks:#liferay> so now, you want to disable the firstname and lastname fields is that it?
10:32 < Andrea_:#liferay> i want them to be rendered like USER ID (not editable) for normal users and editable for a custom role i did in the portal
10:32 < jardineworks:#liferay> ok
10:32 < jardineworks:#liferay> let's start by making sure your hook works.
10:33 < jardineworks:#liferay> modified the fields and set them to disabled.
10:34 < jardineworks:#liferay> these are AUI fields, but I think you can just add a keyword -- disabled -- before the e/>
10:34 < jardineworks:#liferay>  />*
10:34 < jardineworks:#liferay> once you have that, deploy the hook and validate that the fields are in fact disabled now
10:35 < jardineworks:#liferay> (which means you know your hook is working because your changes are being picked up)
10:36 < Andrea_:#liferay> ok, i'm finding the way to disable it
10:36 < jardineworks:#liferay> disabled ... didn't work?
10:36 < jardineworks:#liferay> that's normally how you disable an HTML field
10:38 < jardineworks:#liferay> it might be disabled="true"
10:40 < Andrea_:#liferay> deploying it
10:42 < Andrea_:#liferay> ok
10:42 < Andrea_:#liferay> disabled successfully
10:43 < jardineworks:#liferay> great!
10:43 < jardineworks:#liferay> now we just need the logic to determine whether or not to add that tag right?
10:43 < jardineworks:#liferay> so what is the name of your custom ROLE?
10:43 < Andrea_:#liferay> yes we do
10:43 < Andrea_:#liferay> checking it
10:44 < Andrea_:#liferay> amministratore ufficio personale
10:45 < jardineworks:#liferay> :|
10:45 < jardineworks:#liferay> that is the role name?
10:45 < Andrea_:#liferay> yes xD
10:45 < Andrea_:#liferay> why? are you italian? :D
10:45 < jardineworks:#liferay> lol - ok, and do you place to assign that role to each individual user? or do you plan to have a user group that they are a member of (where the user group is linked to the role)
10:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> I am not
10:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> but I think we share the same name .. my name is Andrew :)
10:46 < Andrea_:#liferay> hahaha yeah!
10:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> but my mother is Spanish (from Spain) so we can pretend my name is Andres :)
10:47 < Andrea_:#liferay> i am planning to assign this role to the hr section of my company
10:47 < Andrea_:#liferay> first name should be disabled to people with just USER role
10:48 < Andrea_:#liferay> (normal employee)
10:49 < jardineworks:#liferay> well
10:49 < jardineworks:#liferay> so I would not use that approach. Instead of using a negative test you should use a positive test.
10:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> so, you want to check "IF user HAS ROLE <your crazy role name> or HAS ROLE "Administrator" then don't put disabled,... and in all other cases you want to have disabled.
10:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> because the person in HR might still have the User role right?
10:51 < Andrea_:#liferay> i guess every user has a collection of roles assigned, right? it would be nice to check if that collection.size=1 and the only item is User
10:52 < jardineworks:#liferay> well, we're going to make it better than that :)... we're going to make it configurable so that you don't have to change your code every time a new role that should be allowed to do it is added.
10:52 < jardineworks:#liferay> ok ... let's start by adding the configuration.
10:52 < Andrea_:#liferay> well, i can work on that, i'm building this portal from scratch so i can decide everything..
10:52 < jardineworks:#liferay> what's your company called?
10:52 < Andrea_:#liferay> synclab
10:53 < jardineworks:#liferay> ok -- so in your portal-ext add something like this (one sec)
10:55 < Andrea_:#liferay> i thought it was a good idea to give every new user a common base role(user in this case), because i will need to develop a portlet to do presence surveyor. And also the boss has to compile his presence form
10:55 < Andrea_:#liferay> at the end of the month
10:56 < jardineworks:#liferay> well, the problem with using USER is that even people are are in other roles could have it right? so I could be both a USER and an ADMINISTRATOR.
10:56 < jardineworks:#liferay> normally in permission checking you check for the role/usergroup that IS allowed to do something
10:57 < jardineworks:#liferay> so in your portal-ext add this --
10:57 < jardineworks:#liferay> ## ------------------------------------------
10:57 < jardineworks:#liferay> ## Custom Properties for USER ADMIN Hook
10:57 < jardineworks:#liferay> ##
10:57 < jardineworks:#liferay> 	#
10:57 < jardineworks:#liferay> 	# Roles allowed to edit user details
10:57 < jardineworks:#liferay> 	#
10:57 < jardineworks:#liferay> 	com.synclab.user.admin.edit.roles=Administrator,HR Employee
10:57 < jardineworks:#liferay> 	#
10:57 < jardineworks:#liferay> 	# User Groups allowed to edit user details
10:57 < jardineworks:#liferay> 	#
10:57 < jardineworks:#liferay> 	com.synclab.user.admin.edit.usergroups=HR
10:57 < jardineworks:#liferay> spaced nicer than that obviously :)
10:57 < jardineworks:#liferay> the names can be whatever you want -- I am just trying to give you and example that is descriptive.
10:58 < jardineworks:#liferay> I have to go for a meeting ... I'll be back, but the next thing we're going to do is RETRIEVE those settings in the JSP ...
10:58 < jardineworks:#liferay> and then test the user for them, and set some boolean flags that we can use to determine whether or not to output "disabled=true"
10:58 < jardineworks:#liferay> or false.
10:58 < jardineworks:#liferay> I'll be back.
10:58 < Andrea_:#liferay> ok, i will be in the office for the next 2 hours. Have a nice meeting! i'll study your input to be prepared for the next time
10:59 < Andrea_:#liferay> thank you ^^
11:15 < jardineworks:#liferay> Andrea_, still there?
11:18 < Andrea_:#liferay> yeah
11:19 < Andrea_:#liferay> was studying the portal-ext.properties and how to override it
11:19 < jardineworks:#liferay> Andrea_, ok -- so next step... did you add those things to your portal-ext.properties file?
11:19 < jardineworks:#liferay> you just add it to your LIFERAY_HOME folder
11:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> Liferay will use it for you at startup for overrides... although in our case we're not overriding, we're adding additional properties
11:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> are you using MySQL?
11:20 < Andrea_:#liferay> the best way is to just go to edit directly this , right? C:\LiferayWorkspace\bundles\tomcat-7.0.42\webapps\ROOT\WEB-INF\classes\portal-ext.properties
11:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> no
11:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> because if you redeploy the bundle, then that tile is lost.
11:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> but in the LiferayWorksapce\bundles folder you can add a portal-ext.properties file
11:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> in there you should also see a data folder, logs folder etc
11:22 < Andrea_:#liferay> ok , adding it (yes i use mysql)
11:26 < Andrea_:#liferay> done
11:26 < jardineworks:#liferay> restart your server
11:26 < Andrea_:#liferay> http://i.gyazo.com/2d5b61d492a2168876fc6f2830a57398.png
11:27 < Andrea_:#liferay> anything wrong?
11:27 < jardineworks:#liferay> you should set the values to your own ones that match your configuration
11:28 < Andrea_:#liferay> i'll change the role name to HR Employee
11:28 < Andrea_:#liferay> do i have to create a group HR too?
11:32 < jardineworks:#liferay> we can do that after
11:33 < Andrea_:#liferay> ok, server is restarting
11:35 < Andrea_:#liferay> done
11:35 < jardineworks:#liferay> check to make sure your hook is still working :)
11:36 < jardineworks:#liferay> (no reason it should not be...)
11:37 < Andrea_:#liferay> working
11:39 < jardineworks:#liferay> ok -- one sec
11:42 < jardineworks:#liferay> ok -- now we're going to modify that jsp again.
11:42 < jardineworks:#liferay> we're going to add a scriptlet (I know I know... scriptlets are the devil etc..)
11:43 < jardineworks:#liferay> start by adding this in your scriptlet
11:43 < jardineworks:#liferay> 	String[] editRoles = PrefsPropsUtil.getStringArray(com.synclab.user.admin.edit.roles, StringPool.COMMA);
11:43 < jardineworks:#liferay> 	String[] editUserGroups = PrefsPropsUtil.getStringArray(com.synclab.user.admin.edit.usergroups, StringPool.COMMA);
11:43 < jardineworks:#liferay> 	boolean editAllowed = Boolean.FALSE;
11:44 < jardineworks:#liferay> so what that is doing is it is using the PrefsPropsUtil... a class provided by Liferay, and checking the properties map for the settings you added to the portal-ext.properties file.
11:44 < jardineworks:#liferay> if it finds it, then it is going to return the list you set as an Array of strings.
11:44 < jardineworks:#liferay> You may need to do a JSP page import for the PrefsPropsUtil and the StringPool classes
11:45 < Andrea_:#liferay> mhmh pretty new to scriptlet, where should i position the scriptlet in the jsp?
11:45 < jardineworks:#liferay> under this line...
11:45 < jardineworks:#liferay> sorry
11:45 < jardineworks:#liferay> under the comment ....
11:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> open the scriptlet .. <%
11:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> and then hit enter a few times, and close it %>
11:47 < Andrea_:#liferay> done
11:48 < jardineworks:#liferay> ok -- add that code from up there inside the scriptlet.
11:48 < Andrea_:#liferay> yes i did it
11:49 < Andrea_:#liferay> it doesnt seems to need page import
11:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> did you deploy?
11:51 < Andrea_:#liferay> yes, it deploys automatically
11:51 < Andrea_:#liferay> every time i save
11:52 < jardineworks:#liferay> ah
11:52 < jardineworks:#liferay> and you reloaded the page and there was no error? same results right?
11:53 < Andrea_:#liferay> wo, blank page
11:53 < jardineworks:#liferay> wo?
11:53 < Andrea_:#liferay> the -details- tab is blan now
11:54 < jardineworks:#liferay> you have an error in your log
11:54 < jardineworks:#liferay> probably missing either the prefs props util, or the stringpool.
11:54 < jardineworks:#liferay> check your TOMCAT_HOME/logs/catalina.out
11:54 < Andrea_:#liferay> Taglib directive: Mandatory attribute prefix missing
11:54 < Andrea_:#liferay> i think thats the error
11:55 < Andrea_:#liferay> the complete line is :

11:59 < jardineworks:#liferay> fixed?
12:01 < Andrea_:#liferay> nope
12:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> don't paste it in here... use something like pastebin, but you need to provide the whole error including the stacktrace.
12:06 < Andrea_:#liferay> http://pastebin.com/W9TL6V6F
12:08 < bijoo:#liferay> Andrea_: check Control Panel->Server Administration->Properties->Portal Properties-> for com.synclab.user.admin.edit.roles
12:08 < jardineworks:#liferay> com.synclab.user.admin.edit.usergroups
12:08 < jardineworks:#liferay> needs to be in quotes
12:08 < jardineworks:#liferay> its a string
12:08 < bijoo:#liferay> Andrea_: if the property's there, issue is this: the method call is the issue needs fix
12:08 < bijoo:#liferay> jardineworks: haha, good catch, I shouldn't have assumed
12:09 < bijoo:#liferay> Andrea_: did you not quote the property name string?
12:11 < Andrea_:#liferay> still have the error
12:12 < bijoo:#liferay> Andrea_: "check Control Panel->Server Administration->Properties->Portal Properties-> for" property names
12:12 < Andrea_:#liferay> ok, now its restored
12:13 < bijoo:#liferay> Andrea_: what you mean "now"? what did you do it changed?
12:13 < Andrea_:#liferay> i deployed it once more
12:14 < Andrea_:#liferay> closed the tab in the browser and reopened it
12:14 < bijoo:#liferay> Andrea_: okay, interesting, might browser cache
12:16 < Andrea_:#liferay> checked that bijoo, the properties are there! thanks
12:16 < Andrea_:#liferay> nice way to check them
12:18 < jardineworks:#liferay> can you send the new stack trace?
12:19 < jardineworks:#liferay> Andrea_, and a screen shot of your project again
