09:32 < Andrea_:#liferay> good morning to everybody
09:39 < twen:#liferay> Good afternoon Andrea_ :)
09:44 < Andrea_:#liferay> I was trying to render First Name field in the my account portlet not editable for the role "user", i created a hook but i don't know where and what i have to modify something, can you help me?
09:49 < jardineworks:#liferay> Andrea_, I can help you but I need 30 minutes first.
09:49 < jardineworks:#liferay> Andrea_, you created a JSP hook right?
09:49 < Andrea_:#liferay> hi jardine , no problem , take your time of course
09:50 < Andrea_:#liferay> yes i created the hook and overridden edit_user.jsp
09:50 < Andrea_:#liferay> well, i just opened it, still did not edited tho..
09:56 < jardineworks:#liferay> Andrea_, ok cool -- have you found the field that you want to disable?
09:57 < Andrea_:#liferay> no, i'm lost in this jsp
10:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> lol
10:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> ok
10:03 < jardineworks:#liferay> Andrea_, Ok -- I'm going teach  you how to find it. Go to your chrome browser and use the inspector to find some html markup that is specific to the field.
10:03 < jardineworks:#liferay> probably a class name of a div id or something
10:04 < Andrea_:#liferay> ok
10:04 < Andrea_:#liferay> its f12 feature right?
10:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> yep
10:05 < Andrea_:#liferay> i'm ready
