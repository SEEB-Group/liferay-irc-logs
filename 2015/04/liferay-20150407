09:22 < twen:#liferay> Hello... I've a question about the use of dropdown menu vs vocabularies in Document type. What makes you select one over the other ?
10:13 < jardineworks:#liferay> twen, Vocabularies are more taxonomy.
10:14 < jardineworks:#liferay> twen, so you might have a document type of "Form" ... but you want to categorize it as "Auto-Insurance"
10:15 < jardineworks:#liferay> (from the Insurance vocabulary maybe...)
10:15 < jardineworks:#liferay> at least that is how I think of it
10:15 < twen:#liferay> hmmm... so it's usefull if I have multiple document type and want to use the same list
10:15 < twen:#liferay> ?
10:18 < twen:#liferay> mI'm currently building an asset library site. one document type, with multiple metadata sets
10:18 < twen:#liferay> I have to decide if I have to set language list, brands list of subjects list in vocabularies or SELECT list :-/
10:19 < jardineworks:#liferay> twen, what do you mean select list? you mean the tags?
10:20 < twen:#liferay> no.. SELECT field in metadata
