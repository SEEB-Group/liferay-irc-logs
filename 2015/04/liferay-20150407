09:22 < twen:#liferay> Hello... I've a question about the use of dropdown menu vs vocabularies in Document type. What makes you select one over the other ?
10:13 < jardineworks:#liferay> twen, Vocabularies are more taxonomy.
10:14 < jardineworks:#liferay> twen, so you might have a document type of "Form" ... but you want to categorize it as "Auto-Insurance"
10:15 < jardineworks:#liferay> (from the Insurance vocabulary maybe...)
10:15 < jardineworks:#liferay> at least that is how I think of it
10:15 < twen:#liferay> hmmm... so it's usefull if I have multiple document type and want to use the same list
10:15 < twen:#liferay> ?
10:18 < twen:#liferay> mI'm currently building an asset library site. one document type, with multiple metadata sets
10:18 < twen:#liferay> I have to decide if I have to set language list, brands list of subjects list in vocabularies or SELECT list :-/
10:19 < jardineworks:#liferay> twen, what do you mean select list? you mean the tags?
10:20 < twen:#liferay> no.. SELECT field in metadata
10:20 < twen:#liferay> set
10:22 < jardineworks:#liferay> oh
10:23 < jardineworks:#liferay> well, I'm not sure about the metadata set to be honest. I know that in the past I have used the vocabularies specifically in situations where the set of terms that were available needed to be "controlled"
10:24 < jardineworks:#liferay> can you do exercise that same "control" with the metadata set?
10:24 < jardineworks:#liferay> metadata set sounds more like "bulk" adding
10:36 < twen:#liferay> well... I was also thinking on control, and Vocabularies are easier to update (add more entries). Where in Metadata set it looks more tricky (mostly for our Editors)
10:37 < twen:#liferay> Something I dislike in Metadata set SELECT field, you can't reorganised easily the item list... you need to copy/paste key and values
10:38 < jardineworks:#liferay> twen, sounds like you have your answer ;)
10:38 < twen:#liferay> I see metadata set as : you set it once for good, where Vocabularies can be updated during the life of the project
10:39 < jardineworks:#liferay> twen, and, correct me if I am wrong, but applying a meta data is more likely applying MULTIPLE values... where as in a vocabulary, you might just add one value.
10:39 < twen:#liferay> hehe, I may be have the answer, but I like to have a long lasting liferay-way-ish solution. That's why I'm asking for other use case or experiences :)
10:40 < twen:#liferay> that's correct in a sens... a vocabulary can be see as one field in a metadataset... outside of any metadata set.
10:41 < twen:#liferay> If I use vocabularies, I'll have 4 different vocabularies in my form (and none in the metadaset)
10:41 < jardineworks:#liferay> I see
10:42 < jardineworks:#liferay> well, I suppose anther argument for a metasata set is that it is File Type agnostic. So you can apply the same meta data set to different file types right?
10:42 < jardineworks:#liferay> where are defining your vocabulary as part of the file definition means it is only useable for that file type.
10:42 < twen:#liferay> I think both solution (all in Metadata or all in vocabularies) are fine for me.... I guess, but well... I need to take a decision xD
10:42 < twen:#liferay> that's right
10:43 < jardineworks:#liferay> twen, I think that's what I would use a a primary factor for my decision. Will I need to reuse meta-data across file types. If the answer is no, then I suppose Vocabularies might be easiest.
10:43 < twen:#liferay> at this moment, I made the site in such a way, I only have one document type with 3 metadata sets ;) I try to be KISS
10:44 < twen:#liferay> but.. will I use only one document type.. and then metadata once, or not... I agree.. hmmm...
10:54 < twen:#liferay> thank you jardineworks for your help... I've to think about it, you gave some good new arguments :)
10:54 < jardineworks:#liferay> twen, np -- happy to help
10:54 < twen:#liferay> :)
12:41 < vserver-admin:#liferay> hi, am i right here if i have problems setting up liferay?
13:15 < jardineworks:#liferay> vserver-admin, it's one of the places you can seek help :)
13:17 < vserver-admin:#liferay> okay, i have a couple of problems..[I use funtoo/gentoo linux +liferay-tomcat-bundle] i will start at the end, when i execute ./shutdown i get the following error: PM org.apache.catalina.startup.Catalina stopServer SCHWERWIEGEND: Could not contact localhost:8005. Tomcat may not be running.
13:18 < vserver-admin:#liferay> (tomcat is actually running)
13:20 < vserver-admin:#liferay> (if you need more infos let me know)
13:26 -!- mode/#liferay [+o jhf] by ChanServ
13:31 < jardineworks:#liferay> vserver-admin, that's not really a Liferay problem per say :). But that means that it can't contact the shut down port --
13:31 < jardineworks:#liferay> open your server.xml file and check to make sure the port is actually set to 8005
13:32 < jardineworks:#liferay> that'd be step 1
13:32 < jardineworks:#liferay> if it is
13:32 < jardineworks:#liferay> .... is this a local server or a remote one? As in, it is on your machine, or is it a server somewhere else (I assume the latter)
13:32 < vserver-admin:#liferay> it is set to 8005
13:32 < jardineworks:#liferay> if it is the latter, then perhaps there is a firewall blocking you?
13:32 < vserver-admin:#liferay> remote one
13:33 < jardineworks:#liferay> can you telnet to the server with that port?
13:34 < jardineworks:#liferay> err
13:34 < vserver-admin:#liferay> well i guess here is the missing rule: iptables -L Chain INPUT (policy DROP) target     prot opt source               destination          sshguard   all  --  anywhere             anywhere             ACCEPT     all  --  anywhere             anywhere             ctstate RELATED,ESTABLISHED ACCEPT     tcp  --  anywhere             anywhere             tcp dpt:ssh ACCEPT     tcp  --  anywhere             anywhere             tc
13:34 < jardineworks:#liferay> wait -- that doesn't make sesne :)
13:34 < jardineworks:#liferay> lol
13:34 < jardineworks:#liferay> you're ssh'ed into the box I presume
13:34 < vserver-admin:#liferay> yes
13:34 < jardineworks:#liferay> right so you are executing the command locally -- duh
13:35 < vserver-admin:#liferay> that is the reason i havent allowed that port
13:36 < jardineworks:#liferay> sorry?
13:36 < vserver-admin:#liferay> so the firewall is out of the equation
13:38 < vserver-admin:#liferay> or does the firewall rules cover localhost:port ?
13:38 < jardineworks:#liferay> one sec.. fixing my wifes stylus.
13:42 < jardineworks:#liferay> not sure about firewall rule coverage -- I am most certainly not a network admin
13:43 < jardineworks:#liferay> is you do a ps -aux | grep liferay ... is there more than one process listed?
13:44 < jardineworks:#liferay> or actually... what do you get for output when you do a netstat -a | grep 80
13:45 < vserver-admin:#liferay> no there is only one process, netstat -a | grep 80 does not return anythin
13:47 < vserver-admin:#liferay> apache is not started
13:47 < jardineworks:#liferay> the grep 80 should also match 8080 and 8005 etc
13:48 < jardineworks:#liferay> if tomcat is running and bound to those ports.
13:48 < jardineworks:#liferay> can you show me your process output from the ps aux command?
13:48 < vserver-admin:#liferay> i killed java..
13:49 < jardineworks:#liferay> can you try it again? and if it fails show me the ps aux output? are there any errors during startup?
13:49 < vserver-admin:#liferay> i'll restart tomcat & do netstat -a | grep 80
13:52 < vserver-admin:#liferay> tcp        0      0 localhost:8005          *:*                     LISTEN      tcp        0      0 *:8009                  *:*                     LISTEN
13:53 < vserver-admin:#liferay> px aux: http://paste.debian.net/165530/
13:55 < vserver-admin:#liferay> no errors in catalina.out
13:58 < vserver-admin:#liferay> could it be that i have iptalbes to tell to allow localhost access to 8005?
14:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> not sure to be honest.
