04:05 < Andrea_:#liferay> good morning everybody
06:06 < enoch:#liferay> hi all
06:07 < enoch:#liferay> what's the best way to install liferay on ubuntu? is there an official repo?
06:20 < Andrea___:#liferay> https://www.liferay.com/it/community/wiki/-/wiki/Main/Quick+Installation+Instructions maybe this help
06:47 < Andrea___:#liferay> jardine, are u there?
06:51 < Andrea___:#liferay> i'm trying to get the roles of the current user and check if a role is in there, how can i do it?
08:30 < Andrea_:#liferay> anyone here?
08:42 < HashMap:#liferay> yup
08:57 < jardineworks:#liferay> Andrea_, Sorry, can't help today... running out to a client meeting and I won't be back before you go home. I'll be around tomorrow though
08:58 < Andrea_:#liferay> hi! no problem, i'm working on your method over and over :D
09:07 < Andrea_:#liferay> i'm trying to check the current user roles in a jsp , how can i do that?
09:17 < HashMap:#liferay> I'd say through RoleLocalServiceUtil, there's a method getUserRoles(long userId)
09:23 < Andrea_:#liferay> http://pastebin.com/hyyNuwvn
09:24 < Andrea_:#liferay> can u check this method, its from jardine with a little modification by me..I think allowEdit never become true but i don't know why
09:29 < HashMap:#liferay> It seems ok to me
09:29 < Andrea_:#liferay> do i correctly get the current user?
09:33 < HashMap:#liferay> I think it should work..
09:33 < HashMap:#liferay> if I were you, I'd try move this code in the controller and debug it, if every variable is set properly
09:34 < Andrea_:#liferay> how do i do this?
