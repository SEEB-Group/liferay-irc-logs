04:05 < Andrea_:#liferay> good morning everybody
06:06 < enoch:#liferay> hi all
06:07 < enoch:#liferay> what's the best way to install liferay on ubuntu? is there an official repo?
06:20 < Andrea___:#liferay> https://www.liferay.com/it/community/wiki/-/wiki/Main/Quick+Installation+Instructions maybe this help
06:47 < Andrea___:#liferay> jardine, are u there?
06:51 < Andrea___:#liferay> i'm trying to get the roles of the current user and check if a role is in there, how can i do it?
08:30 < Andrea_:#liferay> anyone here?
08:42 < HashMap:#liferay> yup
08:57 < jardineworks:#liferay> Andrea_, Sorry, can't help today... running out to a client meeting and I won't be back before you go home. I'll be around tomorrow though
08:58 < Andrea_:#liferay> hi! no problem, i'm working on your method over and over :D
09:07 < Andrea_:#liferay> i'm trying to check the current user roles in a jsp , how can i do that?
09:17 < HashMap:#liferay> I'd say through RoleLocalServiceUtil, there's a method getUserRoles(long userId)
09:23 < Andrea_:#liferay> http://pastebin.com/hyyNuwvn
09:24 < Andrea_:#liferay> can u check this method, its from jardine with a little modification by me..I think allowEdit never become true but i don't know why
09:29 < HashMap:#liferay> It seems ok to me
09:29 < Andrea_:#liferay> do i correctly get the current user?
09:33 < HashMap:#liferay> I think it should work..
09:33 < HashMap:#liferay> if I were you, I'd try move this code in the controller and debug it, if every variable is set properly
09:34 < Andrea_:#liferay> how do i do this?
09:34 < Andrea_:#liferay> i'm a newbie sorry :/
09:35 < HashMap:#liferay> Or at least try to do System.out.println for every variable, to see, if it is set..
09:35 < HashMap:#liferay> it would then show it in the server output
09:36 < Andrea_:#liferay> ok
09:38 < HashMap:#liferay> However this much code should probably not be in the jsp itself, but in the controller, better in some utility method and you should only pass "editAllowed" to the view with true, or false and not compute it in the view
09:42 < Andrea_:#liferay> can you be more precise?
09:42 < HashMap:#liferay> brb. gonna get coffe and i'll try to explain
09:43 < Andrea_:#liferay> ok, thanks
09:54 < HashMap:#liferay> I am here :)
09:54 < Andrea_:#liferay> nice
09:55 < HashMap:#liferay> well, from the code you posted it looks, that it only sets editAllowed based on current user and some list of groups and roles
09:57 < HashMap:#liferay> i'd probably create a method isEditAllowed somewhere that has the user and list of groups and permissions as parameters
09:57 < Andrea_:#liferay> yeah , basically the aim is checking if the current user has the -hr admin- or -administrator- role and if he has one of them or both, he will be able to edit the firstname of every user
09:57 < HashMap:#liferay> that would return true/false based on your code
09:58 < Andrea_:#liferay> ok
09:58 < HashMap:#liferay> and then in the controller only call this method and pass "editAllowed" in the model to the view
09:59 < HashMap:#liferay> the plus to moving this code from the view to the controller would be easier debugging :)
10:02 < Andrea_:#liferay> but i am pretty sure i can achieve my goal without modifying liferay source code
10:03 < HashMap:#liferay> of course
10:04 < HashMap:#liferay> Well I don't know your project structure so if you need to do it in the jsp, do it in the jsp and try to look at the variables with System.out.println
10:06 < Andrea_:#liferay> ok, thanks
10:07 < HashMap:#liferay> np
10:09 < Andrea_:#liferay> it works lol I wrote <% editAllowed %> without the "!"
10:09 < HashMap:#liferay> :D
10:09 < Andrea_:#liferay> <aui:input disabled="<%= !editAllowed %>" name="firstName" />
10:10 < Andrea_:#liferay> hi jardine we(you) made it!
10:37 < Andrea_:#liferay> for non-admin users, MyAccount portlet is not displayed..this is the error, any suggestions?
10:37 < Andrea_:#liferay> ERROR [http-bio-8080-exec-28][AdvancedPermissionChecker:979] com.liferay.portal.NoSuchResourceActionException: 125#ADD_TO_PAGE
10:44 < bijoo__:#liferay> Andrea_: here's one way to check your code works: Control Panel-> Server Administration -> Script -> Enter code and submit
10:45 < bijoo__:#liferay> Andrea_: here are some tips on using console:

10:53 < Andrea_:#liferay> thanks bijoo
11:18 < josuebc:#liferay> Hi there. I have an issue with importing users from LDAP. Currently I'm using LDAP's UPN field to populate the email address and using the same one to authenticate users. Also the CN to populate the username.
11:19 < josuebc:#liferay> The problem is if an existing user (existing in liferay) gets its UPN changed then when it tries to log into liferay, LR doesn't synch the UPN value. I have to manually delete the user and then it will get imported with the new value
11:20 < josuebc:#liferay> I've been trying to figure out how to make LR do this automatically but I havent' found anything. Any ideas?
11:20 < josuebc:#liferay> Thanks
11:28 < bijoo_:#liferay> josuebc: so just to understand what you're saying: you have LDAP user with UPN; you use UPN as the mapping key; once UPN changed, you want Liferay sync; though currently Liferay don't update right; is this understanding correct to you?
11:29 < josuebc:#liferay> bijoo_: Liferay imports the username
11:29 < bijoo_:#liferay> josuebc: so say we have a user with this map { UPN: me@email.com, cn="meusername" }
11:30 < bijoo_:#liferay> LDAP updates the user's UPN
11:30 < josuebc:#liferay> bijoo_: Liferay imports the user's details correctly. The issue is if there's a change in the UPN then when, an already imported user, tries to login LR doesn't re-synch the UPN
11:30 < bijoo_:#liferay> so now the user's map is as follows  {UPN: me@mail.email.com, cn="meusername"}
11:30 < josuebc:#liferay> bijoo_: Exactly, if the user already exists in LR and the user tries to login to LR with me@mail.email.com then it will fail.
11:31 < josuebc:#liferay> The user will only be able to login using me@email.com
11:32 < bijoo_:#liferay> josuebc: be back in about 10 minutes, talk soon
11:32 < bijoo_:#liferay> I will be back in about 10 minutes*
11:32 < josuebc:#liferay> bijoo_: thanks!
11:51 < bijoo_:#liferay> josuebc: which version of Liferay are you using?
11:52 < bijoo_:#liferay> josuebc: I assume you've set the proper mapping  https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/blob/6.2.3-ga4/portal-impl/src/portal.properties#L3338
11:53 < bijoo_:#liferay> josuebc: wrong line, this is the correct property: https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/blob/6.2.3-ga4/portal-impl/src/portal.properties#L3358
11:53 < bijoo_:#liferay> you probably do since you'd need that there
11:53 < bijoo_:#liferay> josuebc: unless the mail attribute is used too
11:54 < bijoo_:#liferay> josuebc: which would explain why UPN's ignored
11:54 < josuebc:#liferay> bijoo_: 6.2, yes the mapping are correct. The initial import is correct the problem is in the synchronization. The only difference is that I have emailaddress=UserPrincipalName
11:55 < josuebc:#liferay> bijoo_: So then I just add this functionality with a hook
11:56 < bijoo_:#liferay> josuebc: question I have about the sync is this; if UPN is used to map user, how is liferay to know UPN's changed? Seems would need to have another field too; e.g. to sync on a non-changing one
11:58 < bijoo_:#liferay> josuebc: https://www.liferay.com/es/documentation/liferay-portal/6.2/user-guide/-/ai/integrating-existing-users-into-liferay-liferay-portal-6-2-user-guide-17-en
11:58 < bijoo_:#liferay> josuebc: have you set the search filter properly?
11:59 < bijoo_:#liferay> josuebc: so nevermind since you're using email
12:02 < josuebc:#liferay> bijoo_: Well, a LR user needs a uesrname, emailaddress, title and password, right? I am using the email address to login into the potal but the mapping also uses the username which is the CN which is less likely to change.
12:02 < bijoo_:#liferay> josuebc: okay; I'll check the code; see what it does
12:03 < josuebc:#liferay> Now, you just raised an intersting question. The filter I have it setup to search objects by emailaddress... So, if the user changes the UPN in LDAP then LR should be searching for the changed UPN and then realize that the user object needs update, right?
12:04 < bijoo_:#liferay> josuebc: that sounds correct, can you update filter?
12:04 < bijoo_:#liferay> so not emailAddress but UPN
12:05 < bijoo_:#liferay> or did you mean it's set for UPN; so, "emailaddress" = "UPN"?
12:06 < josuebc:#liferay> bijoo_: Yes, sorry. It's set to UPN
12:06 < josuebc:#liferay> Bad habit
12:07 < bijoo_:#liferay> josuebc: maybe LR won't know new UPN; it's using search filter to find user; so therefore finds nothing to sync up to? Maybe, I am not sure; so I'll check code. Give me 10 minutes I'll post back here.
12:10 < josuebc:#liferay> bijoo_: But if I delete the user in LR then LR will create the user with the correct UPN. I would expect to have duplicates, if a user request a UPN change in LDAP then LR would create the username again since one of the keys is UPN. This is not happening.
12:11 < bijoo_:#liferay> josuebc: that's because the screenName would be the same; and that cannot happen, so exception
12:11 < josuebc:#liferay> What I think is happening is that LR uses the email address to search through its local user DB and then uses the CN to compare for the password in LDAP.
12:11 < bijoo_:#liferay> josuebc: I'm checking code to test that assumption
12:11 < bijoo_:#liferay> "The problem is if an existing user (existing in liferay) gets its UPN changed then when it tries to log into liferay, LR doesn't synch the UPN value. I have to manually delete the user  and then it will get imported with the new value
12:12 < bijoo_:#liferay> "
12:12 < bijoo_:#liferay> can UPN-changed user login fine?
12:13 < josuebc:#liferay> bijoo_: If I delete the user in liferay and then the user logs in, LR creates the user with the correct information.
12:14 < bijoo_:#liferay> josuebc: no, I mean before you do all of that; let's continue with prior example: if I login with me@mail.email.com, what happens?
12:14 < josuebc:#liferay> It will fail.
12:14 < josuebc:#liferay> bijoo_: Sorry, the assumption I mentioned before is wrong.
12:14 < bijoo_:#liferay> josuebc: aha, here's a couple more questions; do you have LDAP auth enabled there? And did you state to check LR as well?
12:16 < josuebc:#liferay> LDAP auth is enabled, I've checked and I've tested it. This is a brand new portal instance. If there's a new user the athentication works correctly.
12:17 < bijoo_:#liferay> josuebc: okay, so the default is check Liferay's: "auth.pipeline.enable.liferay.check=true"
12:17 < bijoo_:#liferay> and LDAP auth is enabled as well
12:17 < bijoo_:#liferay> josuebc: meaning the Liferay check will fail, that's why
