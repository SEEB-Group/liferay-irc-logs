10:24 < Andrea_:#liferay> anyone here?
10:24 < Andrea_:#liferay> whats the difference between modifying a portal property from a hook and creating portal-ext?
10:26 < jardineworks:#liferay> Andrea_, you can do it with a hook and not need to restart the server
10:26 < jardineworks:#liferay> and you can undeploy the hook
10:27 < jardineworks:#liferay> but most of the time, personally, I try to do it in the portal-ext so that all my overrides can be found in one place instead of an easter egg hunt all over the plugins.
10:28 < Andrea_:#liferay> well ok, thanks
10:29 < Andrea_:#liferay> another user yesterday suggested me to move that method you wrote in the controller, can this be done with hook?
10:29 < jardineworks:#liferay> which version of the portal are you on again?
10:30 < jardineworks:#liferay> ... actually... I'm not sure that would work. You need the JSP to set the field to disabled right?
10:30 < Andrea_:#liferay> 6.2 cega3
10:30 < jardineworks:#liferay> you could try it with a PortletStrutsAction hook.
