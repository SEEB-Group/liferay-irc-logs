05:15 < CyberKatze:#liferay> hallo, anyone here?
05:15 < CyberKatze:#liferay> installed new LR62GA4 server + DB MSSql. but have error -> ccan not import Structure Basic
05:43 < CyberKatze:#liferay> any idee?
06:12 < CyberKatze:#liferay> ...

10:24 < Andrea_:#liferay> anyone here?
10:24 < Andrea_:#liferay> whats the difference between modifying a portal property from a hook and creating portal-ext?
10:26 < jardineworks:#liferay> Andrea_, you can do it with a hook and not need to restart the server
10:26 < jardineworks:#liferay> and you can undeploy the hook
10:27 < jardineworks:#liferay> but most of the time, personally, I try to do it in the portal-ext so that all my overrides can be found in one place instead of an easter egg hunt all over the plugins.
10:28 < Andrea_:#liferay> well ok, thanks
10:29 < Andrea_:#liferay> another user yesterday suggested me to move that method you wrote in the controller, can this be done with hook?
10:29 < jardineworks:#liferay> which version of the portal are you on again?
10:30 < jardineworks:#liferay> ... actually... I'm not sure that would work. You need the JSP to set the field to disabled right?
10:30 < Andrea_:#liferay> 6.2 cega3
10:30 < jardineworks:#liferay> you could try it with a PortletStrutsAction hook.
10:30 < Andrea_:#liferay> in your opinion, is that code too much for a jsp?
10:30 < jardineworks:#liferay> I suppose put the logic to detect the "disabled" setting in the hook and pass it into the JSP... and use the JSP hook just to add the "disabled" setting
10:31 < Andrea_:#liferay> yeah the suggestion was to pass the editAllowed boolean to the jsp
10:44 < jardineworks:#liferay> Andrea_, sure, now that you know it works you could try that to learn another type of hook
10:45 < jardineworks:#liferay> Andrea_, a lot of people don't like the fact that Liferay uses <% %> so much in their JSP. A purest will say its terrible. It is, to a degree. I think it's not all that bad in Liferay because Liferay just uses it as "getters" of data. They don't calculate things... but if you can avoid it, you probably should.
10:48 < Andrea_:#liferay> In terms of organizing a new project, i was thinking about making a hook with just the overridden properties, so I don't have to the "hunt" part..is that a bad idea?
10:48 < Andrea_:#liferay> have to do*
10:51 < Andrea_:#liferay> since i'm new and i'm building from scratch, I have some difficulties to organize all the modification i'm doing to keep them united in one big project so i can deploy it in future when this will go in production. Can you enlight me about achieving this goal? For example I wanted to remove -poweredbyliferay- and i did a hook to the classic theme, i needed hr and i did another plugin etc..How can I keep all these
10:51 < Andrea_:#liferay> thing together?
11:17 < bijoo_:#liferay> Andrea_:
11:17 < bijoo_:#liferay> Andrea_: I generally do my setup like this:
11:19 < bijoo_:#liferay> Andrea_: note it depends on the type of project; most projects are one of two project types: 1) highly dependant code and plugin types, 2) independent modules and functions
11:20 < Andrea_:#liferay> ok
11:20 < bijoo_:#liferay> for project types of type 1, I do this: create SDK portlet plugin called [project name]-common-portlet, create SDK theme plugin that's called [project name]-common-theme
11:20 < bijoo_:#liferay> I include hooks and portlets in former
11:20 < bijoo_:#liferay> And themes and layout templates in latter
11:21 < bijoo_:#liferay> I separate out independent code; e.g. if function is orthogonal
11:22 < Andrea_:#liferay> so you prefer not using maven?
11:26 < bijoo_:#liferay> Andrea_: it depends on project if I use it; on large projects, I use maven setup; for example, ones with lots of custom; ant for projects with few dependencies.
11:28 < Andrea_:#liferay> One request for me is to create a portlet for Employee Presence Surveyor with Primefaces but its difficult to integrate with service builder
11:30 < Andrea_:#liferay> because maven doesn't have a primefaces+serviceBuilder archetype
11:34 < Andrea_:#liferay> am i wrong?
12:00 < jardineworks:#liferay> Andrea_, all you need to do is create a primefaces portlet and then add to the WEB-INF/ a service.xml file with your entities. The liferay:build-service goal will still work.
12:00 < jardineworks:#liferay> or just use MVC because JSF sucks.
12:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> just sayin' :)
12:02 < bijoo_:#liferay> I haven't used JSF on projects; though I can see it's appeal to some folks.
12:03 < Andrea_:#liferay> yeah it will work but i won't have the visual help from liferay ide on the service.xml
12:03 < Andrea_:#liferay> do you think jsf sucks in general or related to liferay?
12:06 < bijoo_:#liferay> I don't think that it sucks; just don't know it. I'd suggest try it if you haven't yet; and see for yourself how you feel on it. In my mind, it makes dev a bit simpler; though the tradeoff is very sensitive.
12:07 < Andrea_:#liferay> ok!
12:08 < Andrea_:#liferay> have to go, thanks for all the answers!
12:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo_, Andrea_ -- it's too restrictive in terms of javascript usage. Apart from that, the fact that all UI logic is executed on the server, in my opinion, is poor design. JSF I think is useful for server engineers that want to make cool UIs, but server engineers shouldn't build UIs. If you want to build a UI, learn to use the UI languages.
12:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> just my 0.02
12:13 < Andrea_:#liferay> thanks again for the opinion ! bye
12:55 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: that's exactly where I ended up too; so similar to Vaadin as well, right?
12:55 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: and same as GWT framework
12:55 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: although I don't agree we shouldn't make; because it's nice to use a common lang
12:55 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: in terms of managing the project risks
12:56 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: that's how .Net and other shops do it; and actually many folks love that
12:56 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: e.g. ASP.net is like that
12:58 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo_, fair enough. I just feel like JSF certainly had it's place. It was not that long ago that there was no such thing as a "Front End Engineer" ... it was regular Devs make ugly UIs. To speed up the process sure. But the way the industry is now? I mean, I work with some really talented front end guys and JSF drives them nuts. One guy told me that it was equivalent to tying his hands behind his back and asking him to build a responsive site.
12:59 < jardineworks:#liferay> I like the freedom to replace one piece for another
12:59 < jardineworks:#liferay> that is why I love Liferay...
12:59 < jardineworks:#liferay> I can plug in functionality, I can plugin someting to remove functionality...
13:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> and bijoo_ Microsoft? really? that is hardly a good example of flexibility ... it's like calling Apple Open Source :)
13:02 < jardineworks:#liferay> anyway, no doubt there are benfits (rapid prorotyping for example) but I prefer the flexibility.
13:02 < jardineworks:#liferay> I think I am up to 0.05 now :)
13:35 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: :)
13:35 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: I totally agree all that you said; though Vaadin seems to be the exception; the sites are beautiful same approach
13:35 < bijoo_:#liferay> the sites are beautiful yet* same approach
13:36 < bijoo_:#liferay> and today people have seen some great sites; so expectation is much higher now; you can't just make crappy UI no more
13:36 < bijoo_:#liferay> simple, yes; but no more crappy UI
13:37 < bijoo_:#liferay> unfortunately, clutter makes crappy; and a lot of frameworks add needless stuff; they assume you want to have X, Y, Z; whereas you really just want the Z piece
13:38 < bijoo_:#liferay> Though I like it that they give X, Y, Z; just take what you need and hide rest
13:38 < bijoo_:#liferay> of it
13:40 < bijoo_:#liferay> That's what I do with Liferay's UI too; I create a _styled theme andd add my styles; it is not my main theme, but proxy one; it will have same background color and such; but say I need to display the Doc Lib; I will iFrame Doc Lib and use this theme; and have custom styles to strip down to bare; so this way I do not need custom hook; and can update really flexible styles
14:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo_, cool. Most of the UIs I have had to  build on top of Liferay are so vastly different that it's almost impossible to do it with CSS alone.
14:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo_, have you done anything with the Search portlet?
14:08 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: yes, it's only good for most minor stuff; that is for simpler portals and such; where requirements are a lot more lax
14:08 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: I've worked on search on a few occassions
14:08 < bijoo_:#liferay> OpenSearch, Solr, and indexing stuff
14:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo_, I have embedded my search portlet in the navigation
14:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> works great
14:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> but then when I search, I get the results page and the bar dissapears from the navigation
14:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> last time I did this was 6.1 and that did not happen
14:09 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: did you use the runtime portlet in theme?
14:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> yeah
14:10 < bijoo_:#liferay> I did it on 6.2ga3
14:10 < jardineworks:#liferay>  ${theme.runtime(portletId, "", portletSetup.toString())}
14:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> where portletId is 3
14:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> and portletSetup is my preferences
14:10 < bijoo_:#liferay> actually for a demo portal; I just added that line to ftl (directly in ROOT/html)
14:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> on GA 3, does the bar stay in the theme when you are in fullscreen?
14:11 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: oh you mean in maximized mode, I'll check
14:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> yeah
14:20 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: I'll be back in a few minutes; talk soon
14:22 < jardineworks:#liferay> !
14:22 < jardineworks:#liferay> don't leave me hanging!
14:22 < jardineworks:#liferay> lol
14:24 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: I'm back, haha, checking the theme right now
14:34 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo, the suspense is killing me
14:35 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: it is showing even when "maximized"
14:35 < jardineworks:#liferay> :S
14:35 < jardineworks:#liferay> I wonder why mine dissapears
14:35 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: sending you a screenshot of what I mean
14:35 < jardineworks:#liferay> can you share your "embedded" code with me?
14:36 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: very close to the one you have above: ${theme.runtime("3")}
14:38 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: http://imgur.com/gy7fkfe
14:38 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: I just created a new "_styled"-based theme
14:38 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: and new site just to make sure test's valid
14:39 < jardineworks:#liferay> ah! but di the seach bar move to another location? or is it where you put it in NORMAL mode?
14:40 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo_, ok.. I wasn't clearn :)
14:40 < jardineworks:#liferay> I have the search bar on the right in my nav.
14:40 < jardineworks:#liferay> embedded in the navigation.ftl
14:40 < jardineworks:#liferay> then I do a search and I still see the bar, but it moves to the left just above the search resutls,
14:41 < jardineworks:#liferay> I want it to remain in the nav.
14:41 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: it moves when I do search from it, moves down: http://imgur.com/CkZlOkl
14:41 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: but not when other plugins maximize
14:41 < bijoo_:#liferay> maximized*
14:41 < jardineworks:#liferay> right... ok that is what is bad for me
14:41 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: oh I see what you mean, yes that's me too
14:41 < jardineworks:#liferay> I need it to stay where it is
14:42 < jardineworks:#liferay> in 6.1 ,, it doesn't move! www.sprouts,com
14:42 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: interesting, I wonder why that is
14:43 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: it actually doesn't really move; it just displays the text for the search term : "Search Results - Test"
14:44 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: or nevermind, it moves, that's page title
14:44 < jardineworks:#liferay> :S
14:44 < jardineworks:#liferay> what's the point of embedded it if it moves! lol
14:45 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: portlet.add.default.resource.check.whitelist=3,56_INSTANCE_0000,58,82,86,103,113,145,164,166,170
14:45 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: this is why it moves down on the bottom
14:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> eh?
14:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> what does that property do?
14:46 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: I remember now why I said won't move
14:46 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: before I embedded Web Content Search
14:47 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: or let me think about that bit once more
14:47 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: but to answer your question that prop's this: "?p_p_id=3" causes the page to dynamic load it
14:47 < bijoo_:#liferay> yet it's a non-instanceable portlet
14:48 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo_, so I need that property? or I don't?
14:48 < jardineworks:#liferay> because the default seems to contain 3
14:48 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: well it contains three so the portlet works
14:49 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: since search results can appear any page
14:49 < jardineworks:#liferay> right that property skips the namespace stuff
14:49 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: and search is supposed to just work for it
14:49 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: no it's a security proprety; tells portal allow portlet to display; even if it's not added to Layout
14:50 < jardineworks:#liferay> oh I see
14:50 < jardineworks:#liferay> is that new in 6.2?
14:50 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: correction, even if no resource there; no resource for portlet for current page
14:50 < jardineworks:#liferay> because tha sprouts.com site I just referenced? it has embedded portlets in the navigation and I don't recall using that property
14:50 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: it's been there for a while, since before too
14:50 < jardineworks:#liferay> hmm
14:51 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: that's a good point; let's think about that one
14:52 < jardineworks:#liferay> there is a "add-default=resource" property for the portlet.xml or liferay-portlet.xml file as well
14:53 < jardineworks:#liferay> I thought it allowed you to do <input name="mytext" /> and it would auto-namespace it for you
14:53 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: http://www.liferay.com/home?p_p_id=3&p_p_lifecycle=0&p_p_state=maximized&p_p_lifecycle=0&p_p_state=maximized&p_p_mode=view&_3_struts_action=%2Fsearch%2Fsearch&_3_redirect=%2F&_3_keywords=test&_3_groupId=0
14:54 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: that property I recall is this one : requires-namespaced-parameters
14:54 < jardineworks:#liferay> oh right
14:54 < jardineworks:#liferay> my mistake
14:54 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: it seems in liferay's search search bar won't show
14:54 < jardineworks:#liferay> interesting... apparently Liferay uses a Google Search Appliance :)
14:55 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: yes :)
14:56 < jardineworks:#liferay> so what's my option then?
14:56 < jardineworks:#liferay> make a post and set the action to the correct url
14:57 < jardineworks:#liferay> and then hide the embedded portlet?
14:57 < jardineworks:#liferay> seems nasty
14:58 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: I'm testing with portlet 77
14:58 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: I think that's what I used before; it worked
14:59 < jardineworks:#liferay> 77 is the journal content?
14:59 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: nope that jumps down to the main page aswell
14:59 < jardineworks:#liferay> search
14:59 < jardineworks:#liferay> ug
