07:49 < twen:#liferay> Hi
07:50 < twen:#liferay> How can I recover a deleted Metadata set (I deleted by mistake...)
07:50 < twen:#liferay> any clue ?
09:04 < twen:#liferay> OK.. So I didn't find a way to get back my deleted metadata set. Found a more dangerous workaround though :p
09:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> twen -- hey you opted for the meta data in the end over the vocabulary I see
09:21 < twen:#liferay> jardineworks Well.. I had a big thinking session last night :) SO I did a mix, considering the "value" of the metadata :)
09:22 < twen:#liferay> I keep in the metadata set everything that is based on standard. Document metadata are agnostic of the company data.
09:23 < twen:#liferay> I keep in Vacabularies all metadata that are related to the comany... so they can be reused in other part of the Site... Vocabularies are agnostic of the document "type"
