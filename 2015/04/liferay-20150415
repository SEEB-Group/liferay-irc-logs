09:49 < modd_:#liferay> damn, liferay can't handle big zip files :\
09:49 < modd_:#liferay> I'm trying to import a 3.8GB lar file
09:50 < modd_:#liferay> it creates a temp zip file but this file is broken
09:50 < modd_:#liferay> it's not possible to open it an therefore it cannot find the mainfest.xml and everything is screwed...
09:50 < modd_:#liferay> arg
09:53 < jardineworks:#liferay> modd_, 3.8 gig! :O .... I was struggling yesterday to get a 40MB one working!
09:54 < modd_:#liferay> the whole lar-thing is a bunch of ยง%&%
09:55 < modd_:#liferay> I've got a 6.1 lar, had to manipulate it to get it imported to lr 6.1, then had to update to 6.2 which didn't work very well
09:55 < modd_:#liferay> then I had to fix the DB so I can get it exported again
09:56 < modd_:#liferay> and now it cannot import it because of nonsense errors
09:56 < modd_:#liferay> the temp upload file is still good and has the exact same size
09:57 < modd_:#liferay> I doing a MD5 check on both right now
10:01 < ikb:#liferay> Hi all
10:02 < modd_:#liferay> hi
10:02 < ikb:#liferay> i need a way to let the user upload video on a youtube channel using the portal
10:02 < ikb:#liferay> is there a ready solution for this?
10:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> modd_, I have similar frustrations. The whole export/import process seems like a lot of black magic. Yesterday I ran the EXACT SAME LAR file as an import 4 times in a row... same strategies, settings etc. First 3 times it failed. The 4th time it wwork.
10:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> worked*
10:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> ikb, have you checked the marketplace?
10:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> ikb, there is nothing out of the box that I know of -- but someone may have published a plugin for that.
10:05 < modd_:#liferay> I'm soooo glad I never had to use staging..I'm pretty sure it's broken in the same way
10:06 < jardineworks:#liferay> that is what I have to look at next and I am not looking forward to it.
10:06 < jardineworks:#liferay> I mean, I get it, it's complicated. All these entities, relationships between them, etc. But it's still frustrating.
10:06 < modd_:#liferay> afaik staging is build on import/export
10:08 < ikb:#liferay> jardineworks: i have checked the market but there are only portlets to embed you tube videos or playlists
10:08 < ikb:#liferay> jardineworks: have you evere used cdn feature?
10:25 < jardineworks:#liferay> modd_, I believe you are correct.
10:25 < jardineworks:#liferay> ikb, not the config params in Liferay.
10:26 < modd_:#liferay> original_file.lar -> upload_XXXX.lar -> apache-tika-XXX.tmp -> %timestamp%XXXX.lar  ...wtf!?
10:26 < modd_:#liferay> 4x 3,8GB
15:07 < scribe:#liferay> Hi guys. I hear 7.0 development is moving away from YUI/Allow UI to jQuery.  How is that going?
15:49 < smilelws:#liferay> jo
15:49 < smilelws:#liferay> I have a question on theme, can you show only parts of dockbar in a classic theme when going responsive
15:49 < smilelws:#liferay> I only want to show, hamburger menu with pages when the user is in responive/mobile mode?
15:49 < smilelws:#liferay> How can I customize classic liferay theme to achieve this.
15:50 < smilelws:#liferay> here is the forum post I have created for the same, please help
15:50 < smilelws:#liferay> https://www.liferay.com/community/forums/-/message_boards/message/52432345
15:50 < smilelws:#liferay> Thank You!
16:03 < jardineworks:#liferay> smilelws, I think to do that you need to create some JSP hooks that will make changes to the dockbar portlet.
16:03 < smilelws:#liferay> Hi jardineworks, Thank you for the quick reply
16:05 < smilelws:#liferay> is it possible to do that in theme at all or if it is to write a hook, do you know which jsp or jsps need to be overridden?
16:05 < smilelws:#liferay> Thanks and appreciate your help
16:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> smilelws, I don't think you can do it in the theme because the theme just uses a macro for the dockbar portlet.
16:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> so almost positive JSP hook
