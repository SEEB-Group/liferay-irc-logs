09:49 < modd_:#liferay> damn, liferay can't handle big zip files :\
09:49 < modd_:#liferay> I'm trying to import a 3.8GB lar file
09:50 < modd_:#liferay> it creates a temp zip file but this file is broken
09:50 < modd_:#liferay> it's not possible to open it an therefore it cannot find the mainfest.xml and everything is screwed...
09:50 < modd_:#liferay> arg
09:53 < jardineworks:#liferay> modd_, 3.8 gig! :O .... I was struggling yesterday to get a 40MB one working!
09:54 < modd_:#liferay> the whole lar-thing is a bunch of ยง%&%
09:55 < modd_:#liferay> I've got a 6.1 lar, had to manipulate it to get it imported to lr 6.1, then had to update to 6.2 which didn't work very well
09:55 < modd_:#liferay> then I had to fix the DB so I can get it exported again
09:56 < modd_:#liferay> and now it cannot import it because of nonsense errors
09:56 < modd_:#liferay> the temp upload file is still good and has the exact same size
09:57 < modd_:#liferay> I doing a MD5 check on both right now
10:01 < ikb:#liferay> Hi all
10:02 < modd_:#liferay> hi
10:02 < ikb:#liferay> i need a way to let the user upload video on a youtube channel using the portal
10:02 < ikb:#liferay> is there a ready solution for this?
10:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> modd_, I have similar frustrations. The whole export/import process seems like a lot of black magic. Yesterday I ran the EXACT SAME LAR file as an import 4 times in a row... same strategies, settings etc. First 3 times it failed. The 4th time it wwork.
10:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> worked*
10:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> ikb, have you checked the marketplace?
10:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> ikb, there is nothing out of the box that I know of -- but someone may have published a plugin for that.
10:05 < modd_:#liferay> I'm soooo glad I never had to use staging..I'm pretty sure it's broken in the same way
10:06 < jardineworks:#liferay> that is what I have to look at next and I am not looking forward to it.
10:06 < jardineworks:#liferay> I mean, I get it, it's complicated. All these entities, relationships between them, etc. But it's still frustrating.
10:06 < modd_:#liferay> afaik staging is build on import/export
10:08 < ikb:#liferay> jardineworks: i have checked the market but there are only portlets to embed you tube videos or playlists
10:08 < ikb:#liferay> jardineworks: have you evere used cdn feature?
10:25 < jardineworks:#liferay> modd_, I believe you are correct.
10:25 < jardineworks:#liferay> ikb, not the config params in Liferay.
10:26 < modd_:#liferay> original_file.lar -> upload_XXXX.lar -> apache-tika-XXX.tmp -> %timestamp%XXXX.lar  ...wtf!?
10:26 < modd_:#liferay> 4x 3,8GB
15:07 < scribe:#liferay> Hi guys. I hear 7.0 development is moving away from YUI/Allow UI to jQuery.  How is that going?
15:49 < smilelws:#liferay> jo
15:49 < smilelws:#liferay> I have a question on theme, can you show only parts of dockbar in a classic theme when going responsive
15:49 < smilelws:#liferay> I only want to show, hamburger menu with pages when the user is in responive/mobile mode?
15:49 < smilelws:#liferay> How can I customize classic liferay theme to achieve this.
15:50 < smilelws:#liferay> here is the forum post I have created for the same, please help
15:50 < smilelws:#liferay> https://www.liferay.com/community/forums/-/message_boards/message/52432345
15:50 < smilelws:#liferay> Thank You!
16:03 < jardineworks:#liferay> smilelws, I think to do that you need to create some JSP hooks that will make changes to the dockbar portlet.
16:03 < smilelws:#liferay> Hi jardineworks, Thank you for the quick reply
16:05 < smilelws:#liferay> is it possible to do that in theme at all or if it is to write a hook, do you know which jsp or jsps need to be overridden?
16:05 < smilelws:#liferay> Thanks and appreciate your help
16:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> smilelws, I don't think you can do it in the theme because the theme just uses a macro for the dockbar portlet.
16:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> so almost positive JSP hook
16:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> OR!
16:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> :)
16:05 < smilelws:#liferay> hmm
16:06 < jardineworks:#liferay> create your own theme with the classic as a parent and then in your custom.css .. do what you need to, if you can hide/show stuff
16:06 < jardineworks:#liferay> to accomplish what you need I mean
16:06 < jardineworks:#liferay> the dock bar would be... (one sec)
16:06 < smilelws:#liferay> I could hide entirely the dockbar using theme
16:06 < jardineworks:#liferay> probably /html/portlet/dockbar but let me double check
16:06 < smilelws:#liferay> ok thanks
16:07 < jardineworks:#liferay> smilelws, sure you can hide it altogether... but if there is a class or an id you can target for say the "control panel" entry you could modofy the style to hide it when you are in the phone width or something right?
16:07 < jardineworks:#liferay> I just don't know that you can target it like that
16:07 < jardineworks:#liferay> but I am not a css wizard.
16:08 < smilelws:#liferay> If you are going the hook way, wouldn't customizing the dockbar using hook might effect other themes we might have, right?
16:09 < smilelws:#liferay> I am a newbie when it comes to writing altogether a new theme?
16:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> smilelws, yeah.. portal-web/docroot/portlet/dockbar in the portal source which maps to /html/portlet/dockbar at the runtime. So you would find the jsp or jsps you need to alter in that folder and hook them.
16:09 < smilelws:#liferay> Thanks jardineworks.
16:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> smilelws, hmmm... yes, it might. So there is some trickery you might need. Are you using a multi-instance implementation (multiple portal instances) or a multi-site, single instance?
16:10 < smilelws:#liferay> The  hook affect all the themes deployed? I am afraid we are going multiple theme path
16:11 < smilelws:#liferay> so far we had only one, but now we are going to have multiple themes, so hook overriding might affect all of them, right?
16:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> the jsp is not at the theme level so its nto really affecting the theme so much as anywhere the dockbar portlet is added to a page.
16:11 < smilelws:#liferay> But I will start looking into jsp overriding
16:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> the dockbar just happens to be in a hidden caegory and embedded in the theme most of the time
16:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> smilelws, so... in on eof the environments I work we have multiple instances.
16:12 < smilelws:#liferay> okay.
16:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> so think of if as like VMs in a VM server
16:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> one installation of Liferay but it services multiple domains.
16:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> In liferay this is a "Company"
16:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> so... hostnamea.com, hostnameb.com, etc.
16:13 < jardineworks:#liferay> now, hooks are SERVER level things. But in 6.2 there was a property that was introduced to allow you to scope it to a Company.
16:13 < jardineworks:#liferay> but this might now be where you are at.
16:13 < jardineworks:#liferay> so what we do...
16:13 < jardineworks:#liferay> and it's a little odd, but it works :)
16:13 < smilelws:#liferay> so is it possible to have dockbar like we have in classic liferay theme in one and then a cutomized dockbar(with hook) in another?
16:13 < smilelws:#liferay> okay multiple domain is instance, right?
16:14 < smilelws:#liferay> Yes, I am using 6.2 as well
16:14 < jardineworks:#liferay> we create a JSP hook that is general. So like view.jsp for the dockbar. In that JSP we look up a property in the portal-ext.properties file to see which jsp to user. So we have something like property.key.hostnamea=hostnamea.view.jsp ... a
16:15 < jardineworks:#liferay> and we do this in a choose-when-otherwise statement where each when is a host we have configured.
16:15 < jardineworks:#liferay> and in cases where it is a new host, or an unconfigured host where we want to use the default we use the otherwise case and use the view.portal.jsp.
16:16 < jardineworks:#liferay> remember the dockbar is your house. Its the same model all the time -- like in one of those boring suburbanite subdivisions. The theme is just the paint that you use so you can identify your house when you come home drunk :)
16:17 < smilelws:#liferay> hehe
16:17 < jardineworks:#liferay> so you want to change the structure of your house
16:18 < smilelws:#liferay> okay i will look into that property
16:18 < jardineworks:#liferay> start with a JSP hook
16:18 < jardineworks:#liferay> just do the change you need
16:18 < jardineworks:#liferay> and then come back and see me :)
16:18 < smilelws:#liferay> Sure
16:18 < jardineworks:#liferay> I'll help you with the next bit
16:18 < smilelws:#liferay> Actually I am using IRc for the first time and it did work and faster than forum
16:19 < smilelws:#liferay> okay thanks
16:19 < jardineworks:#liferay> sometimes it is slower
16:19 < jardineworks:#liferay> just depends on who is around.
16:20 < smilelws:#liferay> ;)
16:28 < smilelws:#liferay> Jardineworks, Do you have any wiki article or forum post were you can redirect me to have the logic to apply the hook based on instance/companyID?
16:29 < jardineworks:#liferay> smilelws, sorry I don't -- I just came up with it recently :S
16:29 < jardineworks:#liferay> its on my list to do, but haven't had the time
16:29 < smilelws:#liferay> Okay
