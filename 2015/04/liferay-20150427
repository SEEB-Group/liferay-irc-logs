06:05 < Andrea___:#liferay> hi all, how can i find a portlet from its ID? I want to make user&organization portlet available to be added to a page, so i'm doing an -extPlugin and change the liferay.display.xml but I don't know the portlet id. thanks
06:58 < Kravigupta:#liferay> Andrea.. what I do to find the exact id of a portet is.. I check using firebug or some tool and look for a form or any input.. which will include namespace..
06:58 < Kravigupta:#liferay> this gives me a number.. like 1.2.3...
07:00 < Kravigupta:#liferay> This number is id . then check liferay-portlet.xml and portlet-custom.xml in ROOT/WEB-INF to get rest of the details.
09:26 < Andrea_:#liferay> Hi all , i would like to put the Users and Organization portlet (found in the control panel) in a private page. I found this guide https://www.liferay.com/it/web/juan.fernandez/blog/-/blogs/adding-the-workflow-portlets-to-a-page but i can't make it work..can someone help me?
09:43 < ikb:#liferay> hi all
09:43 < ikb:#liferay> someone know a plugin that allow each user to upload videos to youtube?
09:43 < ikb:#liferay> from the portal
11:04 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> hi there ! I've a problem accessing JournalArticlePermission in a JSP. We were including portal-impl.jar in our portlet dependencies, but doing that we faces a log4j classCastException. Here they say never import portal-impl.jar in a portlet : http://tinyurl.com/nevd4oy. Question : how to use objects from portal-impl w/o importing the dependence ? Thanks
11:06 < jardineworks:#liferay> nicolas_FR, You are not supposed to because the portal-impl classes can be changed via EXT plugin, or by building a custom version.You are only supposed to use classes from the portal-service.jar that is in the TOMCAT_HOME/lib/ext.
11:07 < jardineworks:#liferay> if you HAVE to use one, you can use the PortalClassLoaderUtil to retrieve it and then invoke the method via reflection
11:49 < bijoo:#liferay> Andrea_: I tried to the same, it's difficult; the portlet ID is this one here: 125
11:50 < bijoo:#liferay> Andrea_: though it is not so simple if I'm right; do try it and let me know if success.
11:51 < bijoo:#liferay> Andrea_: the way you find it is somewhat simple (depends if you have front end tools handy): open page with the portlet you're looking for; inspect page to find portlet boundary
11:52 < bijoo:#liferay> Andrea_: another approach, do portlet action ; and find the p_p_id param val
11:53 < bijoo:#liferay> nicolas_FR: if you describe usecase, we can suggest; the principle is don't include impl (that is, shouldn't care on portal-impl)
11:53 < Andrea_:#liferay> thanks bijo i retrieved the number from a xml..i will try again..maybe i'm doing something wrong in the ext plugin
11:54 < Andrea_:#liferay> bundles\tomcat-7.0.42\webapps\ROOT\WEB-INF\liferay-portlet.xml here is a sort of mapping
