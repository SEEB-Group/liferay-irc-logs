06:05 < Andrea___:#liferay> hi all, how can i find a portlet from its ID? I want to make user&organization portlet available to be added to a page, so i'm doing an -extPlugin and change the liferay.display.xml but I don't know the portlet id. thanks
06:58 < Kravigupta:#liferay> Andrea.. what I do to find the exact id of a portet is.. I check using firebug or some tool and look for a form or any input.. which will include namespace..
06:58 < Kravigupta:#liferay> this gives me a number.. like 1.2.3...
07:00 < Kravigupta:#liferay> This number is id . then check liferay-portlet.xml and portlet-custom.xml in ROOT/WEB-INF to get rest of the details.
09:26 < Andrea_:#liferay> Hi all , i would like to put the Users and Organization portlet (found in the control panel) in a private page. I found this guide https://www.liferay.com/it/web/juan.fernandez/blog/-/blogs/adding-the-workflow-portlets-to-a-page but i can't make it work..can someone help me?
09:43 < ikb:#liferay> hi all
09:43 < ikb:#liferay> someone know a plugin that allow each user to upload videos to youtube?
09:43 < ikb:#liferay> from the portal
11:04 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> hi there ! I've a problem accessing JournalArticlePermission in a JSP. We were including portal-impl.jar in our portlet dependencies, but doing that we faces a log4j classCastException. Here they say never import portal-impl.jar in a portlet : http://tinyurl.com/nevd4oy. Question : how to use objects from portal-impl w/o importing the dependence ? Thanks
11:06 < jardineworks:#liferay> nicolas_FR, You are not supposed to because the portal-impl classes can be changed via EXT plugin, or by building a custom version.You are only supposed to use classes from the portal-service.jar that is in the TOMCAT_HOME/lib/ext.
11:07 < jardineworks:#liferay> if you HAVE to use one, you can use the PortalClassLoaderUtil to retrieve it and then invoke the method via reflection
11:49 < bijoo:#liferay> Andrea_: I tried to the same, it's difficult; the portlet ID is this one here: 125
11:50 < bijoo:#liferay> Andrea_: though it is not so simple if I'm right; do try it and let me know if success.
11:51 < bijoo:#liferay> Andrea_: the way you find it is somewhat simple (depends if you have front end tools handy): open page with the portlet you're looking for; inspect page to find portlet boundary
11:52 < bijoo:#liferay> Andrea_: another approach, do portlet action ; and find the p_p_id param val
11:53 < bijoo:#liferay> nicolas_FR: if you describe usecase, we can suggest; the principle is don't include impl (that is, shouldn't care on portal-impl)
11:53 < Andrea_:#liferay> thanks bijo i retrieved the number from a xml..i will try again..maybe i'm doing something wrong in the ext plugin
11:54 < Andrea_:#liferay> bundles\tomcat-7.0.42\webapps\ROOT\WEB-INF\liferay-portlet.xml here is a sort of mapping
11:54 < bijoo:#liferay> Andrea_: I ran into a permission error; something with regard to portlet 90 (which is listed as a system portlet; specifically named "Portal" portlet)
11:54 < bijoo:#liferay> Andrea_: exactly, that has the full portlet list
11:54 < bijoo:#liferay> Andrea_: though hard to know which one is which on page
11:55 < bijoo:#liferay> Andrea_: as such I suggested the two methods before
11:55 < Andrea_:#liferay> yes its better your method..
11:55 < bijoo:#liferay> ikb: check the Marketplace since many are there
11:57 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo, Andrea_ you can also use the PortletKeys class which has constants defined to make it easier. For example, the users admin is defined with the constant -- public static final String USERS_ADMIN = "125";
11:58 < Andrea_:#liferay> nice, thanks jardine.
11:58 < Andrea_:#liferay> I'll let you know if i succeed at putting that portlet into a page
11:59 < jardineworks:#liferay> Andrea_, you are using a jsp?
12:00 < Andrea_:#liferay> for what?
12:00 < jardineworks:#liferay> you said you want to embed the portlets in a page right?
12:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> is this a custom portlet that you are going to put on a page that will contain the admin portlets? or are you trying to add the portlets directly to the page?
12:01 < Andrea_:#liferay> i need to have the Users and organization portlet (which is in the control panel) in a private page of a site
12:01 < Andrea_:#liferay> directly, i would like to add directly that portlet
12:02 < Andrea_:#liferay> that's because i'm developing a company portal and my boss want a HR site with some private pages..One of these pages must have the user management
12:03 < Andrea_:#liferay> and i thought it was stupid and not reccomandable to develop it from scratch since liferay have a good one..I'll use custom fields for the custom elements
12:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> Andrea_, you could also create an HR role where you only provision to that role the items from the control panel you want HR to see.
12:05 < Andrea_:#liferay> Yes i did that, my -hr admin- role can navigate to Admin(upper right side) and only see the user&organization portlet
12:05 < Andrea_:#liferay> but my boss want it added to a page :/
12:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> Andrea_, sigh. Oh to have a boss that understands.
12:13 < jardineworks:#liferay> Andrea_, well, those portlets are not visible to the regular application (as you probably already know) so you need to embed them in a page.
12:13 < jardineworks:#liferay> You could create a wrapper "HR Portlet" with the <runtime/> tags in the jsp
12:14 < jardineworks:#liferay> or a hr-theme perhaps that is applied to just their page that embeds the portlets.
12:19 < Andrea_:#liferay> hmhmmh you are speaking arab to me xD I've been on liferay for just one month
12:23 < jardineworks:#liferay> Andrea_, if you create a new portlet called HR Portlet for example, that portlet will have a view.jsp and will be available to be dropped onto a page right?
12:23 < Andrea_:#liferay> yes
12:25 < Andrea_:#liferay> ah ok, i got your tip. But isn't always a good practice to not duplicate code/jsps/etc ?
12:25 < jardineworks:#liferay> ok -- so that view.jsp can contain a tag called <runtime/> and this tag you can use to embed portlets in a page.
12:25 < jardineworks:#liferay> by embedding the portlets you get the changes that might one day be made to them -- bug fixes, ui improvements etc.
12:26 < jardineworks:#liferay> so don't copy the user portlet JSP tree and put it into your portlet, embed the user admin portlet inside yours.
12:26 < Andrea_:#liferay> wow, this could work! but how can this be done practically speaking?
12:27 < jardineworks:#liferay> start by making your hr portlet project. Tell me when you have it done :)
12:31 < Andrea_:#liferay> I'm on liferay ide (eclipse). I did a portlet project with liferay mvc, ok?
12:33 < jardineworks:#liferay> Andrea_, perfect.
12:33 < jardineworks:#liferay> Now deploy it to your server
12:33 -!- mode/#liferay [+o jhf] by ChanServ
12:33 < jardineworks:#liferay> add a page, and then place the hr-portlet on the page.
12:34 < Andrea_:#liferay> oh no..eclipse just crashed..i need to restart all, i will be back in 2 minutes..i'm sorry :S
12:35 < jardineworks:#liferay> sure
12:35 < Andrea_:#liferay> need to restard the pc, see you in 2 minutes!
12:38 < Andrea_:#liferay> here i am, starting the server, i'll hot deploy the portlet
12:40 < jardineworks:#liferay> Andrea_, disclaimer -- I have never tried what you are doing before but in theory it should work. give me five minutes
12:41 < Andrea_:#liferay> no problem, if this work you saved me a lot of time and troubles
12:43 < jardineworks:#liferay> Andrea_, ok -- now yo uhave the portlet deployed and on a page right?
12:44 < Andrea_:#liferay> its still deploying.. it o.O
12:45 < jardineworks:#liferay> Andrea_, bijoo_ I totally lied earlier. I said you could use the PortletKeys class, but it's not actually in the portal-service.jar so I don't thiink you can
12:46 < bijoo:#liferay> jardineworks: that's a great suggestion, hope that it works! Andrea_ let us know if the approach works for you
