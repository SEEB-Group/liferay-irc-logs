06:05 < Andrea___:#liferay> hi all, how can i find a portlet from its ID? I want to make user&organization portlet available to be added to a page, so i'm doing an -extPlugin and change the liferay.display.xml but I don't know the portlet id. thanks
06:58 < Kravigupta:#liferay> Andrea.. what I do to find the exact id of a portet is.. I check using firebug or some tool and look for a form or any input.. which will include namespace..
06:58 < Kravigupta:#liferay> this gives me a number.. like 1.2.3...
07:00 < Kravigupta:#liferay> This number is id . then check liferay-portlet.xml and portlet-custom.xml in ROOT/WEB-INF to get rest of the details.
09:26 < Andrea_:#liferay> Hi all , i would like to put the Users and Organization portlet (found in the control panel) in a private page. I found this guide https://www.liferay.com/it/web/juan.fernandez/blog/-/blogs/adding-the-workflow-portlets-to-a-page but i can't make it work..can someone help me?
