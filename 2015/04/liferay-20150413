09:34 < modd_:#liferay> jhf: is it possible to comment on comments in the marketplace? I don't see any way and simply do another comment is lame :P
09:36 <@jhf:#liferay> modd_: nope, marketplace comments aren't threaded :(
09:36 < modd_:#liferay> :\
09:36 < modd_:#liferay> ok, thx
09:37 <@jhf:#liferay> it wouldn't be hard to add it since the underlying framework is the same used for forums (and blog comments, which are threaded)
12:25 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey jhf do you know if there have been any issues logged with building EXT plugins using 6.2 EE SP10
12:25 < jardineworks:#liferay> other than the one I added on Friday that is...
12:30 <@jhf:#liferay> heh... i haven't heard or seen any fires related to that lately.. SP11 was just released Friday FYI
12:32 < jardineworks:#liferay> ah
12:32 < jardineworks:#liferay> alrighty then
12:32 < jardineworks:#liferay> maybe I'll try that
15:47 < jardineworks:#liferay> anyone here (jhf?) know if it there is an api call that will allow me to get the list of roles that a user has via group association, without looping over all the roles in each group the user is a member of?
19:54 < bijoo_:#liferay> hi all, defining a workflow  right now; my use case is when a group member submits for publication, that other role members be able to approve (but not the submitter even though submitter is part of the role.)
19:55 < bijoo_:#liferay> so it's not obvious what to do there; since one can add roles, but cannot specify any exclusions. or else one can specify a singler user which doesn't help.
19:55 < bijoo_:#liferay> the only way i can think of it working is to create ad-hoc role and add all the members to it.
19:55 < bijoo_:#liferay> though that seems way far-fetched. realistically i'll probably have to create ext or else modify kaleo.
