10:37 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, Started my POC with the 6.2CE branch last night. There are only a few places where I can see that it might still be an issue, but overall not too many changes to try to add this "aliasing" feature.
10:37 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, hopefully it all works out and I can submit it as a pull request :)
10:37 < jardineworks:#liferay> ... once I figure out how to submit pull requests haha
10:45 <@jhf:#liferay> lol
10:45 <@jhf:#liferay> every time I have to do a PR I have to re-learn git
10:45 <@jhf:#liferay> BUT I did make a mental leap last time that seems to have cleared up some confusion for me
10:45 <@jhf:#liferay> (I'm used to mercurial)
10:46 <@jhf:#liferay> I finally sat down to RTFM and this one helped me the most: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches/git-branch
10:46 <@jhf:#liferay> also Liferay does not use git in the "usual" way
10:46 <@jhf:#liferay> actually I take that back
10:46 <@jhf:#liferay> publicly, we do
10:46 <@jhf:#liferay> but we also use git to maintain EE
10:46 <@jhf:#liferay> and it's an odd thing we do
10:47 <@jhf:#liferay> but it's private, so nevermind :0
10:47 < jardineworks:#liferay> lol
10:47 < jardineworks:#liferay> all organizations do odd things inernally :)
10:47 <@jhf:#liferay> basically, I finally realized what linus meant when he treats git branches as simply pointers to specific commits (points in time)
10:48 <@jhf:#liferay> there's no real "physical" branch / set of files that are different than their master counterparts
10:48 <@jhf:#liferay> branches are just pointers
10:48 <@jhf:#liferay> like pointers in c/c++ !
10:49 <@jhf:#liferay> all of you saying "well, duh" can go "pound sand"
10:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> lol
10:52 < jardineworks:#liferay> I have always thought of branches as "time machines" :). But it is a very different concept than in SVN -- so its easy to get confused.
10:52 <@jhf:#liferay> yep
10:53 <@jhf:#liferay> you can't have private branches in a public git repo
10:53 <@jhf:#liferay> so we have to have a separate repo for EE, but the "master" branch in that repo is identical to the public CE branch.
10:53 <@jhf:#liferay> then we have branches for EE
10:53 <@jhf:#liferay> it's messed up and really easy to submit busted PRs
10:59 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, that is not really inspiring me :)
10:59 <@jhf:#liferay> hahahaha
10:59 <@jhf:#liferay> well you don't have to worry about it!
11:00 <@jhf:#liferay> btw I met some folks from Bas-Cap-Pel√© NB
11:00 <@jhf:#liferay> ever heard of it?
11:01 <@jhf:#liferay> it's way over there by Moncton
