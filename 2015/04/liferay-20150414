01:29 < Axxell:#liferay> Hey guys im having problem with actually liferay developer studio, still trial version, allthough i have an license (unsure where the developer studio license is). Ive imported som CE projects into developer studio and i get the following error on all projects
01:30 < Axxell:#liferay> build-common-theme.xml:13: java.io.IOException: Cannot run program "C:\java\jdk775\jre\bin\java.exe": CreateProcess error=206, The filename or extension is too long
01:30 < Axxell:#liferay> all the paths are short as heck
01:30 < Axxell:#liferay> java is under java/version
01:30 < Axxell:#liferay> liferay developer studio is under liferayee/liferay developer studio
02:53 < Axxell:#liferay> cant find where the problem would be, its only the css scss part of the compile which fails every time
02:58 < Axxell:#liferay> what i can see is that it puts the complete path in the classpath variable when trying to build the css
02:59 < Axxell:#liferay> so the classpath is just long as heck: http://pastebin.com/09nHz7BZ

10:48 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey bijoo_ did you sort out your workflow issue?
10:50 < plekplek:#liferay> hey jardineworks, would you have a sec or two at some point to look at my file copy hook?
10:52 < plekplek:#liferay> i’ve managed to duplicate a file into a draft state, but there could be some key step that i’m missing in the hook structure
10:59 < jardineworks:#liferay> plekplek, I could have a look in an hour or so
11:00 < jardineworks:#liferay> plekplek, the draft state is no good?
11:00 < jardineworks:#liferay> plekplek, I think I remember reading somewhere that you have to add a file to the DL and the do an update on the status in order to get it into a "non draft" state
11:36 < plekplek:#liferay> jardineworks, yes, that should be a minor thing. however, the hook itself probably needs some restructuring, because it tries to run the copy method before loading the appropriate jsp. probably because i’ve copied the structure of the move functionality, which is a built-in struts action
11:39 < jardineworks:#liferay> ok -- email me your hook
11:48 < plekplek:#liferay> alright, i sent it
11:49 < plekplek:#liferay> if you try to copy a file from the root directory, there is a problem with no such file or directory
11:50 < jardineworks:#liferay> plekplek, is that the issue you want me to look at?
11:53 < plekplek:#liferay> the main problem is probably the structure itself. when attempting to copy something, it runs the actual copy entry method and then loads the jsp where you select the destination etc
11:54 < plekplek:#liferay> and it tries to copy the file to the root directory, which is the default
11:55 < plekplek:#liferay> so it should load the jsp and then run the copy method upon submitting the target folder
14:00 < jardineworks:#liferay> plekplek, sorry man -- haven't had a chance to look -- trying to knock some things off my list today and the export/import process is being a pain in the ass.
