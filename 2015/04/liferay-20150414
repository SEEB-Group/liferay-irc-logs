01:29 < Axxell:#liferay> Hey guys im having problem with actually liferay developer studio, still trial version, allthough i have an license (unsure where the developer studio license is). Ive imported som CE projects into developer studio and i get the following error on all projects
01:30 < Axxell:#liferay> build-common-theme.xml:13: java.io.IOException: Cannot run program "C:\java\jdk775\jre\bin\java.exe": CreateProcess error=206, The filename or extension is too long
01:30 < Axxell:#liferay> all the paths are short as heck
01:30 < Axxell:#liferay> java is under java/version
01:30 < Axxell:#liferay> liferay developer studio is under liferayee/liferay developer studio
02:53 < Axxell:#liferay> cant find where the problem would be, its only the css scss part of the compile which fails every time
02:58 < Axxell:#liferay> what i can see is that it puts the complete path in the classpath variable when trying to build the css
02:59 < Axxell:#liferay> so the classpath is just long as heck: http://pastebin.com/09nHz7BZ
