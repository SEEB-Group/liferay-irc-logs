16:14 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey jhf -- do you know if it is possible to get the portlet preferences in a jsp for a taglib?
16:14 <@jhf:#liferay> ummm. what do you mean "for a taglib"
16:14 <@jhf:#liferay> you mean *from* a taglib?
16:15 < jardineworks:#liferay> I'm making changes to the Search portlet right now... I added a configuration to the configuration.jsp, but I need to read it to alter the display in the html/taglib/ui/search/start.jsp
16:15 < jardineworks:#liferay> so in the html/taglib/ui/search/start.jsp I need the portlet preferences so I can read the value
16:15 <@jhf:#liferay> hmmm
16:16 <@jhf:#liferay> I think a better way is to pass it into the taglib from the portlet hsp
16:16 <@jhf:#liferay> jsp
16:16 <@jhf:#liferay> isn't that cleaner?
16:16 < jardineworks:#liferay> ah
16:16 < jardineworks:#liferay> yes much
16:16 < jardineworks:#liferay> :)
16:16 < jardineworks:#liferay> never thought of changing that part lol
16:16 <@jhf:#liferay> but is the taglib already prepared to take your config item?
16:16 <@jhf:#liferay> like, is it one of the parameters of the tag?
16:16 <@jhf:#liferay> errr.. attributes
16:16 <@jhf:#liferay> whatever
16:17 < jardineworks:#liferay> ugh -- no
16:17 < jardineworks:#liferay> that is the issue I guess
16:17 <@jhf:#liferay> welp the clean way is to modify the taglib to accept it as a param
16:17 <@jhf:#liferay> then modify the portlet code to pass it
16:18 <@jhf:#liferay> that way you keep portlet and portlet config separate from the (presumably reusable) taglib
16:18 <@jhf:#liferay> if you have access to the request/response pair from taglib code, then you could *probably* get at the preferences
16:19 < jardineworks:#liferay> basically, the FacetedSearcher doesn't bother with the AssetCategoryIds list that is set on the SaerchContext. So I made my own faceted searcher .. extending the FacetedSearcher to add the logic. Now I modified the configruation.jsp for the search portlet so that you can pick a topic you wnat to filter on. But in the start.jsp for the taglib I need to add a select field that will show the categories for the topic.
16:19 <@jhf:#liferay> but you'd have to be careful to ensure it doesn't fail if that taglib is used in a different portelt without said config
16:19 < jardineworks:#liferay> I think there is a request, but I don't think it has a renderRequest.
16:23 < jardineworks:#liferay> changing tag lib classes requires ext plugin ... booo
16:24 <@jhf:#liferay> welp
16:24 <@jhf:#liferay> you could copy the taglib code into your portlet :)
16:24 <@jhf:#liferay> it's kinda hacky, but... EXT is scary
16:25 < jardineworks:#liferay> I don't have a portlet though... I am trying to use an OOTB with a hook :)
16:25 <@jhf:#liferay> ahh
16:25 <@jhf:#liferay> well copy it into your hooked jsp then..?
16:25 <@jhf:#liferay> the search portlet can't be that complex, I don't think
16:26 <@jhf:#liferay> I mean, the UI
16:26 < jardineworks:#liferay> there are a lot of scriptlets
16:26 < jardineworks:#liferay> its pretty gross lol
16:27 < jardineworks:#liferay> I do have a conditional for my "preference" modification...
16:27 < jardineworks:#liferay> so, still not ideal of course, but if I could get the preferences in the taglib start.jsp then i would be set.
16:27 < jardineworks:#liferay> not sure that I can though
16:28 < jardineworks:#liferay> this -- String portletResource = ParamUtil.getString( request, "portletResource" ); -- is giving me null :(
16:58 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, I think I finally understood what you were suggesting. I took the contents of the start.jsp and replaced the tag lib usage with them so that I have everything in the html/portlet/search/view.jsp now
16:58 < jardineworks:#liferay> but .. there is no renderRequest in that jsp?! I thought all portlets render cycles had the renderRequest in the jsps?
17:00 <@jhf:#liferay> yes there should be!
17:00 <@jhf:#liferay> did you include the <portlet:defineObjects> or whatever that one tag is?
17:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> oops
