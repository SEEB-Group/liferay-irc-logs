06:17 < Axxell:#liferay> hey everybody
06:18 < goku_:#liferay> hi,am trying to deploy the google-analytic-portlet in liferay6.2ceGA3, but its throwing error while using it,anybody worked with this google analytic portlet? https://github.com/rotterdam-cs/liferayGoogleAnalytics-portlet
06:19 < Axxell:#liferay> im trying to put some permissionsupport for a portlet of mine... ive done a resource action mapping thingy, which seemed to be working, until the view rights disappeared for the guest user. Now i cant find a way to be able to access the view rights for that portlet at all
06:19 < Axxell:#liferay> ive added the view action key whichi i earlier deleted
06:19 < Axxell:#liferay> but it still is not available
06:41 < Axxell:#liferay> to clarify, after screwing around with existing and default permissions, the view permission went missing for guest users... i also tried to put the view right from the control panel to the guest user, but its not available for this specific portlet
06:42 < Axxell:#liferay> all others have it
06:42 < Axxell:#liferay> but not this one
06:56 < jardineworks:#liferay> goku_, what's the error?
06:58 < goku_:#liferay> jardineworks: when i deployed the war file first time its showed like java.io.FileNotFoundException: The requested resource (/liferayGoogleAnalytics-portlet/WEB-INF/servlet/view/portal/googleanalytics/view) is not available
06:59 < goku_:#liferay> jardineworks: then is edited the web.xml file in there one entry was there <servlet-name>ViewRendererServlet</servlet-name><url-pattern>/WEB-INF/servlet</url-pattern>
07:00 < goku_:#liferay> but there where on folder was found with name servlet in WEB-INF
07:00 < goku_:#liferay> one folder was there with name views
07:00 < goku_:#liferay> so i changed the url pattern as <url-pattern>/WEB-INF/views</url-pattern
07:02 < goku_:#liferay> then the previous error was gone.but then i selected the Google analytics Configuration from the site content side tab ,then only heading is showing "Google Analytics Configuration" with empty page
07:02 < jardineworks:#liferay> and no exceptions in the log?
07:03 < goku_:#liferay> one exception in there [SerializableSessionAttributeListener:93] com.rcs.configuration.portlet.ConfigurationController is not serializable and will prevent this session from being replicated
07:03 < jardineworks:#liferay> interesting... the ga-configuration portlet has not view-template init param specified https://github.com/rotterdam-cs/liferayGoogleAnalytics-portlet/blob/master/docroot/WEB-INF/portlet.xml
07:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> goku_, unless you are in a cluster, that message won't matter
07:04 < goku_:#liferay> jardineworks:ok
07:05 < goku_:#liferay> in the log one more error is there Invalid Authorization Code
07:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> goku_, that might be the google stuff you need to pass to google to authenticate yourself. Hvae you set that stuff up? (I have never used this portlet btw)
07:06 < goku_:#liferay> in the documentation pdf of their its shows like on the first view there are asking the client id and secret
07:07 < goku_:#liferay> but that view itself not coming
07:07 < jardineworks:#liferay> interesting... ok here is what I am wondering
07:08 < jardineworks:#liferay> the portlet-xml is referencing /view.jsp as the view for one portlet, and isn'et specifying anything for the other.
07:08 < jardineworks:#liferay> if I look at the source tree --
07:08 < jardineworks:#liferay> inside the "views" folder ... there is a subfolder googleanalystics that has a lot of jsps
07:08 < jardineworks:#liferay> one called configuration.
07:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> so I wonder if the portlet.xml needs to has added to it ...
07:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> <init-param>
07:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> 			<name>view-template</name>
07:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> 			<value>/views/googleanalytics/view.jsp</value>
07:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> 		</init-param>
07:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> and the other portlet modified to /views/view.jsp
07:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> (so you can remove /view from your servlet mapping)
07:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> can you try that, rebuild and redeploy?
07:10 < goku_:#liferay> jardineworks: ok then i will try that
07:24 < goku_:#liferay> jardineworks: same error happening
07:42 < jardineworks:#liferay> goku_, hmm
07:42 < jardineworks:#liferay> ok -- are you around for a bit?
07:42 < goku_:#liferay> jardineworks: yea i will
07:42 < jardineworks:#liferay> I have a few things I am trying to wrap up right now but I can give it a shot in an hour or two and see.
07:42 < jardineworks:#liferay> if I can get it working I mena..
07:43 < goku_:#liferay> jardineworks: no probs..
07:49 < Axxell:#liferay> anyone got a clue about my funny little problem? i can see that there is a view permission for the portlet in the db
