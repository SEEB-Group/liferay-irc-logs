08:08 < hufg:#liferay> helloo anyone familiar with asset framework?
08:08 < hufg:#liferay> i've got some custom assets rendering and stuff. any way to create custom queries?
08:10 < hufg:#liferay> let's say i have a custom assetentry model which has language and i'd like to filter based on language. i can either modify the corresponding asset rendering jsp or hook the asset rendering in liferay(this is not so good) or i could modify the used query which would be the cleanest
08:10 < hufg:#liferay> gotta say this is pretty hard core with the asset stuff
08:13 < hufg:#liferay> i've got a feeling modifying the hook i need to use a ext plugin to overwrite the class and zz zpzz
08:13 < hufg:#liferay> yepyep i'll modify the render jsps
09:16 < hufg:#liferay> any ideas how to get dependencies with hook?
09:16 < hufg:#liferay> let's say i want to hook a jsp file and use my custom class how would i do that?

10:30 < AndroUser:#liferay> Hi
10:38 < kravigupta:#liferay> Hello
10:46 <@jhf:#liferay> kravigupta: !
10:46 <@jhf:#liferay> hey jardineworks yt?
10:54 <@jhf:#liferay> bijoo ? modd_ ? vsingleton ? anyone else? I need a volunteer for this upcoming drawing in 7 minutes :) and it can't be any of the contestants! :)
10:59 <@jhf:#liferay> hey Jitendra
11:00 < Jitendra:#liferay> Hi
11:00 < Jitendra:#liferay> James ?
11:00 <@jhf:#liferay> yes! :)
11:00 < Jitendra:#liferay> Cool
11:00 <@jhf:#liferay> I need a volunteer!
11:00 < Jitendra:#liferay> How can i help you
11:01 <@jhf:#liferay> ok we actually have 2 drawings to give away stuff today. the first is for Q4 2014 top contributors - the wiiners are kravigupta (he was just here a minute ago), jardineworks, and Jitendra
11:02 <@jhf:#liferay> so let's do that one first. so the way this works is: I create a string that assigns a number to each person
11:02 < Jitendra:#liferay> ok
11:02 <@jhf:#liferay> I then hash that string using the SHA-1 algorithm and tell you the result
11:02 <@jhf:#liferay> then you will pick a number from 1 through 3
11:02 < Jitendra:#liferay> ok
11:02 <@jhf:#liferay> and that will identify the winner. then I will reveal the string so that you can verify the winner and know that the string was generated before the number was chosen.
11:03 <@jhf:#liferay> so in a moment I will ask you for a number.
11:03 < Jitendra:#liferay> ok
11:03 <@jhf:#liferay> ok the sha1 hash of the special string is f7e26f2ae7bced210a6e440a7ff30a7c0920f307
11:03 <@jhf:#liferay> now, Jitendra go ahead and pick a number from 1 to 3!!
11:04 <@jhf:#liferay> (drumroll please)
11:04 <@jhf:#liferay> and tell ravi to get in here! :)
11:05 <@jhf:#liferay> Krzysztof!
11:05 < kgolebiowski:#liferay> hi
11:05 < Jitendra:#liferay> I would like to pick 1
11:05 <@jhf:#liferay> your raffle drawing will be in a few moments as soon as we finish the other one
11:06 <@jhf:#liferay> wow.... and the winner is.........
11:06 <@jhf:#liferay> Jitendra!!! you have won!!
11:06 < Jitendra:#liferay> great ..
