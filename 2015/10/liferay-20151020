09:58 < dave_k:#liferay> Hi all... I found a hint that I could import a WAR file into Liferay IDE, converting it in the process to a Maven project via m2e-wtp. But "import liferay binary plugin" needs a Plugin SDK, which I thought to be Ant only. So either I don't see how to employ a Maven Plugin SDK or I'm missing the right import option ... is anybody here able to shed some light on this?
