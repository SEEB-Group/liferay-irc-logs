21:24 < slide:#liferay> Does anyone know if there is a way to create a custom full screen page? We are migrating to liferay from our old platform which has a custom password reset tool. I need to migrate that over and I specifically need to be able to verify the accounts liferay username so I need to be able to use the liferay apis.
