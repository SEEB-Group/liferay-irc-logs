12:12 < dave_k:#liferay> Hi all ... I'm having problems with DynamicQueries. Essentially, I need to translate the SQL construct "where (classPK, classNameId, createDate) IN (<subquery>)" to a dynamic query. I surmise that I need something like a PropertyListFactoryUtil.forNames("classPK", "classNameId", "createDate"), which of course does not exist. But how can I achieve that?
