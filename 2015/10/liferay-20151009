05:22 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> hi there
05:23 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> Help ! :( java.lang.ClassCastException: com.liferay.portlet.PortletPreferencesImpl cannot be cast to com.liferay.portlet.PortletPreferencesWrapper. We're stuck here after migrating from L6.1.2 to L6.2 ga4
05:23 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> we're using struts bridge and configuration action, but it won't work
07:47 < jardinworks:#liferay> hi nicolas_FR -- are you still seeing the issue?
07:58 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> jardinworks: yes :(
07:59 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> we were on L5.2.3 with struts bridge. When we migrated on L6.1.2 CE, we had on some test servers this exception too, but we could not figure what was the problem. Finally one day we had a server working w/o this error (but no clue why)
07:59 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> and all was working. Today we are now migrating to L6.2 CE4, and problem is back. Impossible to use portlet preferences with a configuration page.
08:00 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> as soon as we charge the page with our portlet using PortalUtil.getPreferences(strutsRequest), we have the exception.
09:49 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> btw I posted on forums, but was tagged as a spam : https://www.liferay.com/community/forums/-/message_boards/category/239390. Waiting for an admin to validate my post
