05:30 < reigo:#liferay> Hi
05:32 < reigo:#liferay> I'm trying to learn more about Liferay 7 and specifically about maven + service builder - First question being - is it too early to start trying to build a test-project on liferay 7.0.0-a1?
07:18 < DreamStiffler:#liferay> Wow finally some people in
07:18 < DreamStiffler:#liferay> lets see how many actually online
07:19 < DreamStiffler:#liferay> I guess none
07:23 < DreamStiffler:#liferay> Oh Helllooooooo
07:44 < DreamStiffler:#liferay> 2 questions. Im using Eclipse with Liferay IDE. Where do i put things that i normally put in portal-ext.properties?
07:44 < DreamStiffler:#liferay> Second question
07:44 < DreamStiffler:#liferay> I used ${theme.runtime("3")} for search portlet to appear in theme
07:45 < DreamStiffler:#liferay> How do i customize this search portlet. Id like to just use the search without the dropdown option
07:45 < DreamStiffler:#liferay> Currently im using css to hide it
07:45 < DreamStiffler:#liferay> which i dont think is the right way
07:45 < DreamStiffler:#liferay> so ill be checking the logs.
07:45 < DreamStiffler:#liferay> So do help me
07:45 < DreamStiffler:#liferay> Cheers

08:25 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> hi DreamStiffer
08:25 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> *fler
08:26 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> fact is Liferay is in America, so most guys who will answer you will come online in like... 3-4 hours
09:57 -reigo:#liferay- I'll try again as much time has passed:
09:57 < reigo:#liferay> I'm trying to learn more about Liferay 7 and specifically about maven + service builder - First question being - is it too early to start trying to build a test-project on liferay 7.0.0-a1?
09:59 < reigo:#liferay> as far as i've gathered infomation it seems that 7 will have big changes thanks to more modular code but I haven't really found any good documentation yet on migrating development tools from 6.2 for example.
10:00 < reigo:#liferay> i'm specifically mostly interested in maven based service builder projects. if any of you know a url or some example that's based on the upcoming 7 then it would be greatly appreciated
11:24 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> reigo maybe you should post on liferay forums and come back here with a thread url
11:25 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> so if you have an answer, information is not lost but on a forum
11:31 < reigo:#liferay> Fair point
11:51 < dave_k:#liferay> Is it just me, or is liferay.com down?
20:30 -!- ServerMode/#liferay [+o ChanServ] by adams.freenode.net
22:46 < DreamStiffler:#liferay> Well reigo got his answer
22:47 < DreamStiffler:#liferay> And I didnt
22:47 < DreamStiffler:#liferay> I know you guys are from states
22:47 < DreamStiffler:#liferay> Stop arming countries that kill civillians
