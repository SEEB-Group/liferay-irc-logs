08:28 < benmor:#liferay> hello com.liferay.portlet.PortletPreferencesImpl cannot be cast to com.liferay.portlet.PortletPreferencesWrapper do you know why ?
08:34 < benmor:#liferay> on com.liferay.portal.util.PortalImpl.getPreferences(PortalImpl.java:4392)
08:35 < benmor:#liferay> liferay 6.2
08:59 < winem_:#liferay> hi, is it possible to change the portals default landing page (which the user is redirected to after log out) per site?
09:21 < benmor:#liferay> you can't on 6.1.2
09:30 < winem_:#liferay> I guess it's related to your question?
09:36 < benmor:#liferay> no
09:36 < winem_:#liferay> to mine, great. we're running 6.2
09:36 < winem_:#liferay> I would assume that there is any property or something else that our developers could use. or how do you handle it with multiple customers in one liferay instance?
09:56 < jardinworks:#liferay> winem_: it's a global setting... default.landing.page. You would need to write a PostLoginHook to do it "by site"
10:03 < winem_:#liferay> and the PostLoginHook would overwrite the setting for the users session, right?
10:08 < jardinworks:#liferay> winem_: not necessarily
10:08 < jardinworks:#liferay> it just means that you are adding some code to run for a user after a successful login.
10:09 < winem_:#liferay> ok. I know hooks from git, e.g. so I guess it will work in a similiar way
10:09 < jardinworks:#liferay> and in your case, you would be, with that code, trying to figure out which site they were trying to go to and then looking up a config -- either a Site Expando value (custom field) or soemthing in the proeprties file (PrefsPropsUtil.getString(...) )
10:09 < winem_:#liferay> oh ok..
10:09 < jardinworks:#liferay> and then using the response object, once you have the destination url, you can do a responese.sendRedirect(url)
10:09 < jardinworks:#liferay> you could also set the value of the LAST_PATH parameter in the request.
10:10 < jardinworks:#liferay> but that would only work if you were using the redirect to last path property with a value of true.
10:11 < jardinworks:#liferay> that property is most useful for scenarios where the user is perhaps deep in the site when they trigger a login ... and post login you want them to go back to where they were.
10:11 < winem_:#liferay> is it possible to do something like: if user logged out redirect him to the vhost for session?
