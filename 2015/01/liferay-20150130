07:50 < plekplek:#liferay> is anyone available to help me confirm or disprove of my idea of document sharing user structure?
07:55 < plekplek:#liferay> it is going to be a place where images and other documents are going to be gathered for a city region, and companies and different instances will be given access to parts of that content, depending on their needs etc. my first throught was to create a community site and create teams to which people could be added, and that those teams would hold the permissions to content. i guess this would work, defining that site members have view access to all
07:55 < plekplek:#liferay> documents, but document folders would be inherited by team permissions
07:55 < plekplek:#liferay> would it make any difference if making this an organization (city region), and add people in to user groups in similar ways? a user group could be a company, but maybe also just a permission specific group (i.e. access to folder x)
08:45 < plekplek:#liferay> is it possible to actually separate view and download permissions for documents? could a user be given access to view document previews but not download original file out of the box?
09:24 < jardineworks_:#liferay> plekplek, out of the box I don't think so. You would probably have to hook that functionality in
09:30 < amlfree:#liferay> anyone online?
09:54 < jardineworks_:#liferay> amlfree, pretty quiet but I am sure someone is around :)
09:56 < amlfree:#liferay> jardineworks_: I have one question regarding xmlrpc. I would like to know how I can list which methods are available from xmlrpc
09:57 < jardineworks_:#liferay> amlfree, across the entire portal?
09:58 < amlfree:#liferay> jardineworks_: what do you mean exactly ?
09:59 < amlfree:#liferay> I setup a xmlrpc, I just would like to know which methods are accessible from outside
10:01 < jardineworks_:#liferay> amlfree, I'm not sure I follow. When you say you set up xmlrpc ... you mean you installed the tunnel-services?
10:01 < jardineworks_:#liferay> err.. tunnel-web?
10:02 < jardineworks_:#liferay> I can't remember what its called :)
10:02 < amlfree:#liferay> yes from web
10:02 < amlfree:#liferay> but I can't list available methods
10:03 < jardineworks_:#liferay> so ... my question was did you install the tunnel-web app? was the "yes from web" meant to say "Yes I installed that"
10:03 < amlfree:#liferay> absolutely
10:04 < jardineworks_:#liferay> ok great :)
10:05 < jardineworks_:#liferay> and then how are you accessing it?
10:05 < amlfree:#liferay> via a python client
10:05 < amlfree:#liferay> what do you advise me to check it up ?
10:06 < amlfree:#liferay> how can I check which methods are available from this tunnel ?
10:06 < jardineworks_:#liferay> amlfree, ok -- in your browser... when you go to http://localhost:8080/api/axis  what do you see?
10:08 < amlfree:#liferay> jardineworks_: I don't have desktop, running it from command line
10:10 < amlfree:#liferay> Do you know  a proper documentation regarding this feature please ?
10:11 < jardineworks_:#liferay> amlfree, you should still be able to curl the url
10:11 < jardineworks_:#liferay> amlfree, documentation ... hmm.. lemme check, which version are you on?
10:12 < amlfree:#liferay> 6.1.30 EE
10:18 < jardineworks_:#liferay> amlfree, hmm... not tracking anything "official" down.
10:18 < amlfree:#liferay> what do you mean exactly?
10:18 < jardineworks_:#liferay> you don't have a desktop... so you are running this on a server then?
10:19 < amlfree:#liferay> jardineworks_: no, I meant user interface, sorry
10:20 < amlfree:#liferay> I find no documentation regarding a good configuration of this feature
10:20 < jardineworks_:#liferay> amlfree, well, couple things. First place to look is in the portal.properties for anything that might be related. There are some security things and stuff in there.
10:20 < jardineworks_:#liferay> second, this feature is really an extension of service builder and making services remotely accessible -- so you might find explanations there
10:20 < jardineworks_:#liferay> BUT
