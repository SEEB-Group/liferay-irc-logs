06:58 < Andreaaaaaa:#liferay> hi all, if you have to implement an employee registry , do you use the liferay users management portlets and customize them, or would you just build it from scratch?
06:59 < Andreaaaaaa:#liferay> by employee registry i mean the place where you store employee informations, where you add employee and do CRUD operations on them
