03:44 < douglascrp:#liferay> morning everyone
03:44 < douglascrp:#liferay> I'm doing a research about how to customize the liferay result list
03:45 < douglascrp:#liferay> what I want to do is to allow the user to search both in liferay and alfresco
03:45 < douglascrp:#liferay> I think what I need is federated-search
03:45 < douglascrp:#liferay> when the user types a term to search, I want liferay to do the normal work, searching on its content, and also calls the alfresco's search, using the same term
03:46 < douglascrp:#liferay> then liferay should take both results and combine them before showing
03:46 < douglascrp:#liferay> is that possible? any hint about where should I focus?
03:46 < douglascrp:#liferay> is this a think to be implemented using hooks?
03:46 < douglascrp:#liferay> for know, I'm simply trying to focus on what I should be learning about...
03:51 < douglascrp:#liferay> for *now

08:56 < jardinworks:#liferay> douglascrp: it is, but it takes some "magic" :)
08:57 < jardinworks:#liferay> douglascrp: most of the changes that you want to make to search (like you are describing) require hooks
08:57 < jardinworks:#liferay> douglascrp: how far have you gotten so far?
08:58 < douglascrp:#liferay> jardineworks, hey dude
08:58 < douglascrp:#liferay> I did nothing
08:58 < douglascrp:#liferay> I'm just researching
08:58 < douglascrp:#liferay> trying to collect ideas and then I'm going to work on it
08:58 < douglascrp:#liferay> do you have any sample?
08:59 < douglascrp:#liferay> I don't want to reinvent the wheel
08:59 < jardinworks:#liferay> douglascrp: eesh -- been a while and i would have to do some digging to find that code. Last time I did it was in 6.1 but I have a couple of ideas to share with you :)
08:59 < douglascrp:#liferay> so I'm trying to get best practices and tips in order to avoid wasting time in the wrong thing
