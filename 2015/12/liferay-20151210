03:44 < douglascrp:#liferay> morning everyone
03:44 < douglascrp:#liferay> I'm doing a research about how to customize the liferay result list
03:45 < douglascrp:#liferay> what I want to do is to allow the user to search both in liferay and alfresco
03:45 < douglascrp:#liferay> I think what I need is federated-search
03:45 < douglascrp:#liferay> when the user types a term to search, I want liferay to do the normal work, searching on its content, and also calls the alfresco's search, using the same term
03:46 < douglascrp:#liferay> then liferay should take both results and combine them before showing
03:46 < douglascrp:#liferay> is that possible? any hint about where should I focus?
03:46 < douglascrp:#liferay> is this a think to be implemented using hooks?
03:46 < douglascrp:#liferay> for know, I'm simply trying to focus on what I should be learning about...
03:51 < douglascrp:#liferay> for *now

08:56 < jardinworks:#liferay> douglascrp: it is, but it takes some "magic" :)
08:57 < jardinworks:#liferay> douglascrp: most of the changes that you want to make to search (like you are describing) require hooks
08:57 < jardinworks:#liferay> douglascrp: how far have you gotten so far?
08:58 < douglascrp:#liferay> jardineworks, hey dude
08:58 < douglascrp:#liferay> I did nothing
08:58 < douglascrp:#liferay> I'm just researching
08:58 < douglascrp:#liferay> trying to collect ideas and then I'm going to work on it
08:58 < douglascrp:#liferay> do you have any sample?
08:59 < douglascrp:#liferay> I don't want to reinvent the wheel
08:59 < jardinworks:#liferay> douglascrp: eesh -- been a while and i would have to do some digging to find that code. Last time I did it was in 6.1 but I have a couple of ideas to share with you :)
08:59 < douglascrp:#liferay> so I'm trying to get best practices and tips in order to avoid wasting time in the wrong thing
08:59 < douglascrp:#liferay> nice
08:59 < jardinworks:#liferay> for starters, you are bang on in terms of using the federated search -- which is in fact the "search" portlet.
08:59 < douglascrp:#liferay> would you mind to send me an email when you find the time?
09:00 < jardinworks:#liferay> the good news is that it's super customizeable.
09:00 < jardinworks:#liferay> sure -- shoot me your email address.
09:00 < douglascrp:#liferay> ok.. PM

10:09 < jardinworks:#liferay> how did it all go? great success?
10:15 < dtordable:#liferay> Hello jardinworks
10:16 < jardinworks:#liferay> hi dtordable
11:21 <@jhf:#liferay> jardinworks: and jardinworks: great success! I mean I accomplished what I wanted.. we'll see if it makes a diff :)
11:32 < jardinworks:#liferay> jhf: no doubt it will. NAS2015 seemed to be a pretty great success so if that is any indicator...
14:27 < dtordable:#liferay> jard√≠nworks you there?
14:30 < dtordable:#liferay> Jardinworks finally opened the user guide and I'm learning :)
14:45 < jardinworks:#liferay> dtordable: my user guide? :)
14:46 < dtordable:#liferay> I meant liferay's user guide hahaha
14:51 < jardinworks:#liferay> haha
