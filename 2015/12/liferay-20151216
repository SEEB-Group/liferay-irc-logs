08:03 < winem_:#liferay> Hi, we're running liferay behind a apache configured as reverse proxy using mod_proxy_http. http connections work fine but https-connections are not trusted because all the  style sheets etc are referenced per http. how to avoid this behaviour? do we just have to change the virtual host settings from http://domain.com to https or is anything else required? there seems to be no respective settings in the portal-ext.properties
08:09 < modd_:#liferay> why the hack we don't have "i" and "I" here: https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/blob/master/portal-impl/src/portal.properties#L3591 !?!?
08:13 < winem_:#liferay> I guess it's to avoid some issues with look-alike characters
08:14 < modd_:#liferay> that makes no sense
08:14 < winem_:#liferay> why not?
08:15 < modd_:#liferay> if your policy require one uppercase letter and your password is "Iamgroot" it will be "too trivial" and the user doesn't understand, why the password don't work
08:17 < winem_:#liferay> oh ok, I understand... I just saw that only "i" is missing. So I would not expect l and I in this list
08:18 < winem_:#liferay> so, I agree. it's inconsistent..
