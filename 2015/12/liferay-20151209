05:21 < Andrea_:#liferay> hi all , anyone online?
05:29 < Andrea_:#liferay> i added some custom fields to user and i want to move them from "custom field" to other jsps. For example i added "place of birth" and wanted to show it in "Details" tab. Do i have to override any struts action or is it ok to just the custom field via jsp tag?
05:50 < plekplek:#liferay> you should be able to render it using a jsp hook
05:52 < Andrea_:#liferay> ok but i placed "place of birth" in the details section, how can he persist that value with me just dropping that field with liferay taglib
05:52 < plekplek:#liferay> make sure to set the custom field permissions accordingly, i.e. view and update for user role
05:53 < Andrea_:#liferay> in the jsp*
05:53 < plekplek:#liferay> the custom-attribute tag should handle the persistence for you
05:53 < plekplek:#liferay> liferay-ui:custom-attribute
05:55 < Andrea_:#liferay> wow, how is this possible for a tag to handle the persistence ? i checked the EditUserAction in usersAdmin portlet and there is NO reference to expando or custom fields in fact..where is the java code that make this possible? thanks a lot plekplek
