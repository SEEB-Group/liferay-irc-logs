05:21 < Andrea_:#liferay> hi all , anyone online?
05:29 < Andrea_:#liferay> i added some custom fields to user and i want to move them from "custom field" to other jsps. For example i added "place of birth" and wanted to show it in "Details" tab. Do i have to override any struts action or is it ok to just the custom field via jsp tag?
05:50 < plekplek:#liferay> you should be able to render it using a jsp hook
05:52 < Andrea_:#liferay> ok but i placed "place of birth" in the details section, how can he persist that value with me just dropping that field with liferay taglib
05:52 < plekplek:#liferay> make sure to set the custom field permissions accordingly, i.e. view and update for user role
05:53 < Andrea_:#liferay> in the jsp*
05:53 < plekplek:#liferay> the custom-attribute tag should handle the persistence for you
05:53 < plekplek:#liferay> liferay-ui:custom-attribute
05:55 < Andrea_:#liferay> wow, how is this possible for a tag to handle the persistence ? i checked the EditUserAction in usersAdmin portlet and there is NO reference to expando or custom fields in fact..where is the java code that make this possible? thanks a lot plekplek
06:05 < Andrea_:#liferay> May i ask one more question..I have to add a section on the right side when you edit a user in the user&organization portlet. It will be called "documents" and it will contain a new jsp. Can this be done with Hooks? Or do i have to use EXT?
06:06 < plekplek:#liferay> the custom-attribute tag uses the CustomAttributeTag class: https://docs.liferay.com/portal/6.2/taglibs/liferay-ui/custom-attribute.html
06:10 < plekplek:#liferay> it is possible to add new jsps with additional logic using a hook
06:11 < Andrea_:#liferay> so if i just have to make a new JSP with JUST custom attributes i don't need to edit any strutsAction right?
06:15 < _Andrea_:#liferay> i disconnected :( did you wrote something? thanks a ton anyway :)
06:18 < plekplek:#liferay> nope, not yet. iâ€™m a bit of a slow poke here, doing a couple of things at the same time :)
06:18 < plekplek:#liferay> if you are just going to use custom fields in the jsp, there is no need to edit any struts action
06:30 < Andrea___:#liferay> thanks a lot!
