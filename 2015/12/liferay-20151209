05:21 < Andrea_:#liferay> hi all , anyone online?
05:29 < Andrea_:#liferay> i added some custom fields to user and i want to move them from "custom field" to other jsps. For example i added "place of birth" and wanted to show it in "Details" tab. Do i have to override any struts action or is it ok to just the custom field via jsp tag?
05:50 < plekplek:#liferay> you should be able to render it using a jsp hook
05:52 < Andrea_:#liferay> ok but i placed "place of birth" in the details section, how can he persist that value with me just dropping that field with liferay taglib
05:52 < plekplek:#liferay> make sure to set the custom field permissions accordingly, i.e. view and update for user role
05:53 < Andrea_:#liferay> in the jsp*
05:53 < plekplek:#liferay> the custom-attribute tag should handle the persistence for you
05:53 < plekplek:#liferay> liferay-ui:custom-attribute
05:55 < Andrea_:#liferay> wow, how is this possible for a tag to handle the persistence ? i checked the EditUserAction in usersAdmin portlet and there is NO reference to expando or custom fields in fact..where is the java code that make this possible? thanks a lot plekplek
06:05 < Andrea_:#liferay> May i ask one more question..I have to add a section on the right side when you edit a user in the user&organization portlet. It will be called "documents" and it will contain a new jsp. Can this be done with Hooks? Or do i have to use EXT?
06:06 < plekplek:#liferay> the custom-attribute tag uses the CustomAttributeTag class: https://docs.liferay.com/portal/6.2/taglibs/liferay-ui/custom-attribute.html
06:10 < plekplek:#liferay> it is possible to add new jsps with additional logic using a hook
06:11 < Andrea_:#liferay> so if i just have to make a new JSP with JUST custom attributes i don't need to edit any strutsAction right?
06:15 < _Andrea_:#liferay> i disconnected :( did you wrote something? thanks a ton anyway :)
06:18 < plekplek:#liferay> nope, not yet. iâ€™m a bit of a slow poke here, doing a couple of things at the same time :)
06:18 < plekplek:#liferay> if you are just going to use custom fields in the jsp, there is no need to edit any struts action
06:30 < Andrea___:#liferay> thanks a lot!
10:15 < DarkStar1:#liferay> Hello everyone. I am an hour old into discovering liferay.
10:17 < DarkStar1:#liferay> I was wondering what's the development experience like with IJ IDE development or is it just better to stick with eclipse
10:18 < DarkStar1:#liferay> also is there a Maven sdk for the different projects
10:18 < DarkStar1:#liferay> ?
10:19 < njuneau:#liferay> DarkStar1: Personnaly I use Liferay Developer Studio (Eclipse + Liferay IDE). It's pretty handy especially if you work with tomcat since there are server connectors for it and a lot of editors for Liferay
10:20 < njuneau:#liferay> DarkStar1: And yes, there is a Maven SDK
10:20 < njuneau:#liferay> DarkStar1: Liferay IDE provides some project wizards for Liferay projects, but when using Maven, they really are Maven archetypes
10:23 < DarkStar1:#liferay> njuneau: Thanks for the info. Don't suppose you have a handy link to the maven sdk? The best things I've found are a page created in 2012 and this: https://www.liferay.com/community/wiki/-/wiki/Main/Liferay+Maven+SDK
10:23 < njuneau:#liferay> DarkStar1: dev.liferay.com really comes in handy in those situations
10:23 < njuneau:#liferay> DarkStar1: hang on...
10:24 < njuneau:#liferay> DarkStar1: This should help you get started : https://dev.liferay.com/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/6-2/maven
10:24 < DarkStar1:#liferay> Thank you very much
10:25 < njuneau:#liferay> DarkStar1: My pleasure!
10:26 < njuneau:#liferay> DarkStar1: At some point you'll have to get artefacts for Liferay and the first thing you'll see is how to get EE artefacts in the tutorial - but if you scroll down further, should should see instructions to enable the public Liferay Maven Repository for all the CE artefacts
10:38 < DarkStar1:#liferay> njuneau: Thank you. That is really enjoyable documentation to read, nothing like the usual dreary documentation reads that encourage tea breaks so that one can stay awake
10:38 < DarkStar1:#liferay> :)
10:41 < njuneau:#liferay> DarkStar1: Hehe! good to hear :P
14:42 < dtordable:#liferay> Anyone here?
14:43 < dtordable:#liferay> modd are you here?
14:44 < modd:#liferay> hi
14:44 < modd:#liferay> what's up?
14:44 < dtordable:#liferay> What liferay offers to set up a website?
14:45 < dtordable:#liferay> What can I do with it?
