06:27 < Andrea__:#liferay> hi all! i have to add a section in myAccount portlet, in the menu on the right, under "Identification". I managed to do this via ext plugin, creating a jsp and adding to the myAccount via a property in portal-ext.properties. IS this wrong? is there any way to do it via HOOK? thanks
08:40 < Andrea__:#liferay> anyone connected?
