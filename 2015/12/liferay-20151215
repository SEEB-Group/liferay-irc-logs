10:20 < Elizabeth_:#liferay> Hi
10:22 < Elizabeth_:#liferay> I am following the tutorial "Implementing a UI with Liferay Taglibs" but when I deploy the portlet I have and error from Tomcat
10:22 < Elizabeth_:#liferay> is there anybody that could help me?
11:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> Elizabeth_: what is the error you are getting?
11:14 < Elizabeth_:#liferay> this is the error:
11:14 < Elizabeth_:#liferay>  org.apache.catalina.core.StandardWrapperValve invoke
11:14 < Elizabeth_:#liferay> SEVERE: Servlet.service() for servlet [default] in context with path [/guestbook-portlet] threw exception
11:15 < Elizabeth_:#liferay> java.lang.NullPointerException
11:16 < Elizabeth_:#liferay> also I have this
11:16 < Elizabeth_:#liferay> ERROR [http-bio-8080-exec-1][render_portlet_jsp:132] null
11:16 < Elizabeth_:#liferay> java.lang.NullPointerException
11:17 < Elizabeth_:#liferay> the HelloWorld portlet works fine but this not
11:34 < jardineworks:#liferay> Elizabeth_: sorry one minute.. just on the phone
11:36 < Elizabeth_:#liferay> no problem
11:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> Elizabeth_: can you send me the link to the tutorial?
11:53 < Elizabeth_:#liferay> this is it
11:53 < Elizabeth_:#liferay> https://dev.liferay.com/develop/learning-paths/mvc/-/knowledge_base/6-2/implementing-a-ui-with-liferay-taglibs
11:54 < Elizabeth_:#liferay> sorry that's the last step
11:54 < Elizabeth_:#liferay> this is the beginning: https://dev.liferay.com/develop/learning-paths/mvc/-/knowledge_base/6-2/writing-a-data-driven-application
12:03 < jardineworks:#liferay> Elizabeth -- can you send me the entire stacktrace... use codeshare.io and then shoot me the link
12:06 < Elizabeth_:#liferay> ok let me see
12:08 < Elizabeth_:#liferay> https://codeshare.io/vxZwK
12:08 < Elizabeth_:#liferay> can you see it?
12:19 < jardineworks:#liferay> checkingm
12:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError: com/liferay/learning/portlets/MyHelloWorld : Unsupported major.minor version 52.0 (unable to load class com.liferay.learning.portlets.MyHelloWorld)
12:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> Liferay does not support (officially) java 8
12:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> downgrade your jvm to 7
12:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> (version 51)
12:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> it could be that you are building in eclipse using java 7, but your tomcat runtime is using java 8... you need to make sure that they two are using the same verion.
12:21 < Elizabeth_:#liferay> I have jvm 1.7.0.79
12:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> is that what you have set for tomcat to use as well?
12:22 < jardineworks:#liferay> or perhaps you are using java 8 in eclipse?
12:22 < jardineworks:#liferay> no mistake ... Unsupported major.minor is the result of mixed JVM versions.
12:22 < jardineworks:#liferay> I have had this in the past for 50 and 51 (java 6 and Java 7 respectively)
12:23 < jardineworks:#liferay> if you go to the shell and type java -version, what is the output?
12:24 < Elizabeth_:#liferay> i have this: https://codeshare.io/g5UdG
12:24 < jardineworks:#liferay> and can you check eclipse to see which version you are using in the build process?
12:24 < Elizabeth_:#liferay> In eclipse -> preferences -> server -> runtime environment I have the reference to the jdk 17.0.79
12:24 < Elizabeth_:#liferay> 1.7.0.79
12:25 < Elizabeth_:#liferay> in preferences->java-compiler 1.7
12:25 < jardineworks:#liferay> do you have java 8 installed anywhere on your machine?
12:26 < Elizabeth_:#liferay> and java->installed JREs I have jdk and jre 7 but check in the jdk1.7.0.79
12:26 < Elizabeth_:#liferay> I had but not any more
12:26 < jardineworks:#liferay> do you have a JAVA_HOME variable defined? if so -- where does it point to?
12:26 < Elizabeth_:#liferay> yes, I have it and this points to...
12:27 < jardineworks:#liferay> are you using maven or ANT for your plugin builds?
12:27 < Elizabeth_:#liferay> C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_79
12:27 < Elizabeth_:#liferay> I thing ANT... as I installed the software that in the tutorials says
12:27 < jardineworks:#liferay> easy to tell... do you have a pom.xml file in your project? or a build.xml file?
12:28 < Elizabeth_:#liferay> *think
12:28 < Elizabeth_:#liferay> let me see
12:28 < Elizabeth_:#liferay> build.xml
12:28 < jardineworks:#liferay> which version of ANT are you using?
12:29 < Elizabeth_:#liferay> I think this is part of the Liferay IDE I downloaded
12:30 < Elizabeth_:#liferay> I didn't install directly ANT apart
12:31 < jardineworks:#liferay> for sure it is being built using java 8 and it is trying to deploy it to the server which is running java 7. I mean, that is what that message means. So the trick is to fidn out where the java 8 reference is. I have to go for a bit .. but it sounds like most of your environment is correct. Perhaps ANT itself is referencing a version you don't wnt. CHeck this out:
12:31 < jardineworks:#liferay> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/949678/ant-is-using-wrong-java-version
12:31 < jardineworks:#liferay> have you ever managed to deploy it successfully?
12:31 < Elizabeth_:#liferay> Do you think is better recreate the server?
12:32 < Elizabeth_:#liferay> I mean delete and reconfigure just for be sure?
12:32 < jardineworks:#liferay> if so, and you changed something since, perhaps its a type mismatch... you could try going into TOMCAT_HOME/webapps and removing the portlet.
12:32 < jardineworks:#liferay> and then try to deploy again.
12:32 < jardineworks:#liferay> which OS are you on? Windows?
12:32 < Elizabeth_:#liferay> yes, in fact, the portlet HelloWorld works fine
12:32 < Elizabeth_:#liferay> but the next, guestbook not
12:33 < Elizabeth_:#liferay> Windows 8 in a virtual machine in OSx because the Liferay IDE in mac doesn't work
12:33 < jardineworks:#liferay> It might have worked fine at some point, but it wont be working fine now.. the stacktrace says as much, so it is failing to deploy the new portlet and the version you are looking at is an older version that was previosuly deployed (successfully)
12:33 < jardineworks:#liferay> gotta fly... bbiab
12:33 < Elizabeth_:#liferay> thank you
13:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> Elizabeth_: any luck?
13:07 < Elizabeth_:#liferay> I'm testing
13:08 < Elizabeth_:#liferay> I deleted the portlets directly from TOMCAT_HOM
13:08 < Elizabeth_:#liferay> and I think this works but I'm testing
13:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> ok
13:26 < Elizabeth_:#liferay> yes, it works
