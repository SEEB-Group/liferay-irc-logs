04:26 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: PermissionThreadLocal.getPermissionChecker().getUser()     @see https://docs.liferay.com/portal/6.2/javadocs/com/liferay/portal/security/permission/PermissionThreadLocal.html#getPermissionChecker%28%29
04:26 < bijoo_:#liferay> rocknroll_: check the version liferay; maybe mismatch
04:28 < rocknroll_:#liferay> thanks bijoo_
04:28 < rocknroll_:#liferay> probably is.. i've got 6.2 and sveral versions on 6.1 on my machine
04:29 < rocknroll_:#liferay> also the class that is the problem appears to be in portal-service.jar
04:29 < rocknroll_:#liferay> I've checked the configuration on my old laptop and I cant see any difference to new laptop
04:30 < bijoo_:#liferay> rocknroll_: I see what you mean; setup with Eclipse?
04:30 < rocknroll_:#liferay> although, I only have a backup of my old laptop files, not the actual machine
04:31 < rocknroll_:#liferay> yes, eclipse + liferay ide + bundles downloaded from liferay
