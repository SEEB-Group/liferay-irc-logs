04:26 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: PermissionThreadLocal.getPermissionChecker().getUser()     @see https://docs.liferay.com/portal/6.2/javadocs/com/liferay/portal/security/permission/PermissionThreadLocal.html#getPermissionChecker%28%29
04:26 < bijoo_:#liferay> rocknroll_: check the version liferay; maybe mismatch
04:28 < rocknroll_:#liferay> thanks bijoo_
04:28 < rocknroll_:#liferay> probably is.. i've got 6.2 and sveral versions on 6.1 on my machine
04:29 < rocknroll_:#liferay> also the class that is the problem appears to be in portal-service.jar
04:29 < rocknroll_:#liferay> I've checked the configuration on my old laptop and I cant see any difference to new laptop
04:30 < bijoo_:#liferay> rocknroll_: I see what you mean; setup with Eclipse?
04:30 < rocknroll_:#liferay> although, I only have a backup of my old laptop files, not the actual machine
04:31 < rocknroll_:#liferay> yes, eclipse + liferay ide + bundles downloaded from liferay
04:31 < rocknroll_:#liferay> not sure how to best go about trying to pinpoint the exact issue
04:31 < rocknroll_:#liferay> this was all working great on old laptopp
04:31 < bijoo_:#liferay> https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/blob/6.2.3-ga4/portal-service/src/com/liferay/portal/kernel/util/ArrayUtil.java#L1095
04:31 < bijoo_:#liferay> rocknroll_: if using GA4, the method's there
04:32 < rocknroll_:#liferay> yes, but in 6.1 (which is my problem here) I've been using it too
04:32 < rocknroll_:#liferay> and it is used in asset_publisher/view.jsp
04:32 < bijoo_:#liferay> rocknroll_: if using 6.1, it is not there ( https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/blob/6.1.2-ga3/portal-service/src/com/liferay/portal/kernel/util/ArrayUtil.java )
04:32 < rocknroll_:#liferay> i have a hook that replaces this view.jsp
04:32 < rocknroll_:#liferay> well yeah
04:32 < rocknroll_:#liferay> thats whats got me stumped
04:32 < bijoo_:#liferay> rocknroll_: so must have used GA4 before then
04:33 < bijoo_:#liferay> 6.2*
04:33 < rocknroll_:#liferay> the original liferay provided asset_publisher/view.jsp has it
04:34 < bijoo_:#liferay> rocknroll_: note that's using one in portal-impl
04:34 < rocknroll_:#liferay> oh?
04:34 < bijoo_:#liferay> rocknroll_: which is on the Portal Classloader path
04:34 < rocknroll_:#liferay> how do you know
04:35 < bijoo_:#liferay> rocknroll_: versus portal-service which is global
04:35 < rocknroll_:#liferay> so am I somehow messing up stuff with portal-impl.jar
04:35 < bijoo_:#liferay> rocknroll_: https://www.liferay.com/web/pmesotten/blog/-/blogs/classloading-in-liferay
04:35 < rocknroll_:#liferay> thanks!
04:35 < bijoo_:#liferay> rocknroll_: your hook will be able to use it too
04:36 < bijoo_:#liferay> rocknroll_: hooks are special plugin and use Portal's
04:36 < bijoo_:#liferay> rocknroll_: since original JSP's that way
04:36 < rocknroll_:#liferay> great, this may have pointed me in the right direction!
04:36 < rocknroll_:#liferay> i'll get back to you
04:37 < bijoo_:#liferay> rocknroll_: yes, if no response, I will check later; since I check the logs for channel sometimes
04:38 < rocknroll_:#liferay> no wait.. have I actually just messed up myself when writing code for 6.1 and 6.2 at the same time
04:38 < rocknroll_:#liferay> as I cant find the methods that are missing in the original jsp√§s
04:38 < rocknroll_:#liferay> i may have messed up!
04:38 < bijoo_:#liferay> rocknroll_: well, should use API that you will use; most often API is still the same; but across point release, minor changes; and across major release, huge changes.
04:38 < rocknroll_:#liferay> yeah that's true
04:39 < rocknroll_:#liferay> I'm struggling trying to port over my stuff from 6.1 to 6.2
04:41 < rocknroll_:#liferay> ahhhh I'm an idiot. It appears I have pasted over the wrong jsp files so that my 6.2 hook has 6.2 code in it
04:41 < rocknroll_:#liferay> than dog for version control..
04:43 < bijoo_:#liferay> rocknroll_: okay, and I was wrong on 6.1; it doesn't have one in portal-impl; the one in portal-service is just it; since ArrayUtil not in impl jar
04:44 < bijoo_:#liferay> rocknroll_: so it makes sense that JSP was wrong
04:44 < bijoo_:#liferay> rocknroll_: so 6.2 JSP has method: https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/blob/6.2.x/portal-web/docroot/html/portlet/asset_publisher/view.jsp
04:44 < rocknroll_:#liferay> eclipse is great, but at times is just too easy to work on the wrong file..
04:44 < bijoo_:#liferay> https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/blob/6.2.x/portal-web/docroot/html/portlet/asset_publisher/view.jsp#L37
04:44 < rocknroll_:#liferay> yep, I had messed up the files on two different liferay versions
04:44 < bijoo_:#liferay> rocknroll_: versus 6.1 JSP which doesn't: https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/blob/6.1.1-ga2/portal-web/docroot/html/portlet/asset_publisher/view.jsp
04:45 < rocknroll_:#liferay> exactly
04:45 < bijoo_:#liferay> rocknroll_: hopefully 7.0 will help bit
04:45 < bijoo_:#liferay> rocknroll_: since going towards the OSGi
04:45 < bijoo_:#liferay> rocknroll_: though not sure how much it'll help hook plugin
04:46 < rocknroll_:#liferay> I did my batchjelors thesis on OSGi and modularity; not sure it will help :P
04:46 < rocknroll_:#liferay> here's hoping..
04:51 < rocknroll_:#liferay> oh yes! reverted all changes from git and it works again \o/
04:51 < rocknroll_:#liferay> note to self. work only on oe version at a time..
04:53 < bijoo_:#liferay> rocknroll_: glad helped; what was thesis's conclusion?
04:53 < bijoo_:#liferay> rocknroll_: any shortcomings to OSGi?
04:54 < rocknroll_:#liferay> well yes, some. I comapred to the java 9 Jigsaw project, and could not really come to a conclusion on which would be better
04:54 < rocknroll_:#liferay> both had the good and the bad
04:54 < rocknroll_:#liferay> would need to check back to remember :)
