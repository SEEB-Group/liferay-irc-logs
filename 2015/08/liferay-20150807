04:26 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: PermissionThreadLocal.getPermissionChecker().getUser()     @see https://docs.liferay.com/portal/6.2/javadocs/com/liferay/portal/security/permission/PermissionThreadLocal.html#getPermissionChecker%28%29
04:26 < bijoo_:#liferay> rocknroll_: check the version liferay; maybe mismatch
04:28 < rocknroll_:#liferay> thanks bijoo_
04:28 < rocknroll_:#liferay> probably is.. i've got 6.2 and sveral versions on 6.1 on my machine
04:29 < rocknroll_:#liferay> also the class that is the problem appears to be in portal-service.jar
04:29 < rocknroll_:#liferay> I've checked the configuration on my old laptop and I cant see any difference to new laptop
04:30 < bijoo_:#liferay> rocknroll_: I see what you mean; setup with Eclipse?
04:30 < rocknroll_:#liferay> although, I only have a backup of my old laptop files, not the actual machine
04:31 < rocknroll_:#liferay> yes, eclipse + liferay ide + bundles downloaded from liferay
04:31 < rocknroll_:#liferay> not sure how to best go about trying to pinpoint the exact issue
04:31 < rocknroll_:#liferay> this was all working great on old laptopp
04:31 < bijoo_:#liferay> https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/blob/6.2.3-ga4/portal-service/src/com/liferay/portal/kernel/util/ArrayUtil.java#L1095
04:31 < bijoo_:#liferay> rocknroll_: if using GA4, the method's there
04:32 < rocknroll_:#liferay> yes, but in 6.1 (which is my problem here) I've been using it too
04:32 < rocknroll_:#liferay> and it is used in asset_publisher/view.jsp
04:32 < bijoo_:#liferay> rocknroll_: if using 6.1, it is not there ( https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/blob/6.1.2-ga3/portal-service/src/com/liferay/portal/kernel/util/ArrayUtil.java )
04:32 < rocknroll_:#liferay> i have a hook that replaces this view.jsp
04:32 < rocknroll_:#liferay> well yeah
04:32 < rocknroll_:#liferay> thats whats got me stumped
04:32 < bijoo_:#liferay> rocknroll_: so must have used GA4 before then
04:33 < bijoo_:#liferay> 6.2*
04:33 < rocknroll_:#liferay> the original liferay provided asset_publisher/view.jsp has it
04:34 < bijoo_:#liferay> rocknroll_: note that's using one in portal-impl
04:34 < rocknroll_:#liferay> oh?
04:34 < bijoo_:#liferay> rocknroll_: which is on the Portal Classloader path
04:34 < rocknroll_:#liferay> how do you know
