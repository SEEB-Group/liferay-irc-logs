01:58 < rocknroll_:#liferay> hi all!
02:00 < rocknroll_:#liferay> LR 6.1: I have created a private site, with private pages only
02:00 < rocknroll_:#liferay> also created a buch of web contents
02:00 < rocknroll_:#liferay> now when displaying the list of web contents in an asset publisher, their url is [host]/web/[web content]
02:01 < rocknroll_:#liferay> shouldn't it be [host]/group/[web content]
03:26 < twen:#liferay> Hello
03:27 < twen:#liferay> I'm building a repository of documents in Liferay (part of a whole system). However I've been asked to add URL as document too. Any idea how I can achieve this ?

07:30 < jardineworks:#liferay> twen, what about creating a document on the fly with the url inside it.. like a text file :)
07:30 < twen:#liferay> jardineworks hmm... That could be the case. however each document has its document type and filed attached
07:31 < twen:#liferay> qualifying each document
07:31 < twen:#liferay> that could not work.. even if it's a way, indeed
07:32 < twen:#liferay> oh wait
07:32 < twen:#liferay> I reread your sentence...
07:32 < twen:#liferay> when I add a URL, a document is created with that URL in it... That could work !
07:33 < twen:#liferay> I've to ask my dev if he know how to do that (creation of document on the fly)
07:33  * twen:#liferay is live thinking on the channel
07:33 < twen:#liferay> (sorry)
07:33 < jardineworks:#liferay> twen, haha no worries
07:34 < jardineworks:#liferay> twen, Shouldn't be difficult. I mean, in the end it's all a byte stream right? :)
07:34 < twen:#liferay> thanks
07:34 < twen:#liferay> yep. But the idea is there.. that's important !

16:23 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey jhf is it possible to create an aui:checkbox and have it set to checked?
16:24 <@jhf:#liferay> yep
16:24 <@jhf:#liferay> you may have to set value= instead of checked=
16:25 <@jhf:#liferay> also see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24381194/aui-checkbox-not-showing-as-checked-but-value-is-true
16:25 <@jhf:#liferay> aui is weird sometimes :_
