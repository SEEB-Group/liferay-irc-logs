01:58 < rocknroll_:#liferay> hi all!
02:00 < rocknroll_:#liferay> LR 6.1: I have created a private site, with private pages only
02:00 < rocknroll_:#liferay> also created a buch of web contents
02:00 < rocknroll_:#liferay> now when displaying the list of web contents in an asset publisher, their url is [host]/web/[web content]
02:01 < rocknroll_:#liferay> shouldn't it be [host]/group/[web content]
03:26 < twen:#liferay> Hello
03:27 < twen:#liferay> I'm building a repository of documents in Liferay (part of a whole system). However I've been asked to add URL as document too. Any idea how I can achieve this ?

07:30 < jardineworks:#liferay> twen, what about creating a document on the fly with the url inside it.. like a text file :)
07:30 < twen:#liferay> jardineworks hmm... That could be the case. however each document has its document type and filed attached
