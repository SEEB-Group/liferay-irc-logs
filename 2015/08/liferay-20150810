10:23 < winem_:#liferay> hi together. I have a question regarding the knowledge base tool. one of our new frontend developers wants to make his first steps with liferay and we have a project for a FAQ tool. we would use the knowledge base plugin for this tool. the plugin has been installed and we can create articles, the search works, etc. how to proceed now?! I would suggest to start with the theme development
10:24 < winem_:#liferay> is this the right process? I'm just the stupid admin and would like to support the guy :)
