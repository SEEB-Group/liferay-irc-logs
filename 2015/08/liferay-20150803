15:43 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey jhf -- you around for a quick question?
15:43 <@jhf:#liferay> yeppers
15:43 < jardineworks:#liferay> the Customer Portal...
15:43 < jardineworks:#liferay> how the heck to I find a particular patch.
15:43 < jardineworks:#liferay> and .. how do I find out which fix pack it might be in?
15:44 <@jhf:#liferay> do you know the LPS ticket number of the fix?
15:44 < jardineworks:#liferay> LPE-6520
15:45 <@jhf:#liferay> can you browse https://issues.liferay.com/browse/LPE-6520 or is that restricted?
15:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> restricted :(
15:46 <@jhf:#liferay> ok.. satndby
15:47 < jardineworks:#liferay> k
16:03 <@jhf:#liferay> welp I'm confused cause I can't even find the dang fix pack that the (private) ticket claims it is in.
16:04 <@jhf:#liferay> there must be a better way, I'll ask a support person I know
16:04 <@jhf:#liferay> one question: how did you discover that LPE ticket # ?
16:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, the client forwards security notifications to me when they get them
16:06 <@jhf:#liferay> and there are no links in the notification?
16:23 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf I get a jira
16:23 < jardineworks:#liferay> so right now I have a few of these and I am trying to figure out which ones I have to actually do and which ones are already bundled in a fix pack.
16:28 <@jhf:#liferay> well the brute force method is to go to the list of fix packs for the release (in your case this is 6.1.10 - so go to https://www.liferay.com/group/customer/downloads/portal/patches?p_p_id=1_WAR_osbuiportlet_INSTANCE_4Vqt&p_p_lifecycle=0&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&p_p_col_id=column-2&p_p_col_pos=1&p_p_col_count=3&p_r_p_564233524_resetCur=true&p_r_p_564233524_categoryIds=14068676%2C14068558 and then for each item, click on Release Notes and
16:28 <@jhf:#liferay> search for your LPE
16:28 <@jhf:#liferay> but there must be a better way...
16:35 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf,  i was cheking the release notes (boooo) which is whay I normally do... but I can't always find them
16:36 <@jhf:#liferay> the email notification should have had links to the proper fixpacks for each fix...
16:36 <@jhf:#liferay> but still.. there should be a way to search with an LPE
16:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, how can I get access to the LPE portion of the issues site?
16:47 <@jhf:#liferay> jardineworks: get hired by Liferay
16:47 <@jhf:#liferay> it's not a good idea for us to be using internal identifiers (LPEs) in security bulletins, etc.
16:47 <@jhf:#liferay> since it's like teasing you
16:48 <@jhf:#liferay> but basically, we use LPEs for internal purposes only, so opening that up to customers would have lots of privacy concerns
16:49 < jardineworks:#liferay> oh
16:49 < jardineworks:#liferay> do they get linked to LPS's?
16:54 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah
16:54 <@jhf:#liferay> they do in fact
16:54 <@jhf:#liferay> the LPS in this case is https://issues.liferay.com/browse/LPS-25877
16:54 <@jhf:#liferay> at one point our support team was gonna go through all LPSs and add labels to idnicate which fixpacks
16:55 <@jhf:#liferay> a LPS appeared in.
17:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, ok -- another question. If there a "code block" marker for the blog posts?
17:05 <@jhf:#liferay> the easiest way is to embed a gist
