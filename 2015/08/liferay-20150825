04:57 < winem_:#liferay> hi. our developers created their own theme but the "signin" button is always shown. now they told me that they inherited from the classic theme and not from the unstyled on
04:57 < winem_:#liferay> so, my question: would the signin button disappear if they inherit from the styled theme?

06:29 < plekplek:#liferay> winem_: the sign in button is part of the dockbar, which is called from the theme
