09:34 < distsys:#liferay> Hi All
09:34 < distsys:#liferay> some oen is here ?
09:37 < twen:#liferay> No
09:41 < dave_k:#liferay> most are idling
09:52 < distsys:#liferay> need to start liferay from a clean database
09:52 < distsys:#liferay> i am using oracle
09:52 < distsys:#liferay> some hint to do this
10:03 < jardineworks:#liferay> distsys, create a new database that is empty. Just a schema, with no tables or anything. Provision a user. Configure the database connection in your portal-setup-wizard or portal-ext.properties file and start the server.
10:17 < distsys:#liferay> ah oklay
10:17 < distsys:#liferay> just one doubt jardineworks
10:18 < distsys:#liferay> if i try to use an existing schema, with non liferay tables
10:18 < distsys:#liferay> i am a schema with my own tables
10:18 < distsys:#liferay> will it work like this ?
10:32 < jardineworks:#liferay> well, at startup, Liferay will add the tables it needs to your existing schema
10:33 < jardineworks:#liferay> you just need to make sure that they user you have configured has the rights to create tables. This is a requirement for LR to work.
10:33 < jardineworks:#liferay> I beleive you can set a prefix on the tables too so you could ask liferay to prefix all of its tables with liferay. for example so that you can group them all together
10:34 < jardineworks:#liferay> .. I have never done it though.. just pretty sure I have seen it in the properties file as a option.
10:46 < distsys:#liferay> oh okay thank you jardineworks
