09:39 < hufg:#liferay> helloo any ideas why this happened? :D https://gist.github.com/anonymous/505d986e09665f4d9590
12:01 < doged:#liferay> hi
12:16 < bijoo_:#liferay> doged: hello, have a question about Liferay?
12:16 < doged:#liferay> no
12:16 < doged:#liferay> t now
12:20 < josuebc:#liferay> Hi there. I have a LR instance running 6.2 with tomcat 7.0. I'm trying to create another portal instance but when I hit save it just displays the message "Portal Instance is not available".
12:20 < josuebc:#liferay> I have disabled all custom potrlets, hooks and extensions and deleted kaleos-* portlets. I found a few posts on the forums talking about this. Still no luck.
12:20 < josuebc:#liferay> I am not getting anything on the logs. Any ideas how to get more information about what's failing?
13:28 < bijoo_:#liferay> josuebc: is it 6.2 GA3 version?
13:29 < bijoo_:#liferay> josuebc: also any related errors thrown?
14:19 < josuebc:#liferay> bijoo_: I am not sure if its GA3 version. How can I know?
14:20 < josuebc:#liferay> bijoo_: I don't see anything on the console. I'm trying to figure out how to get some kind of error out. I also tried in another dev environment I have setup and I got a RoleNonExistant eror. Apparently it is looking for a custom role on the new company
14:21 < josuebc:#liferay> I am running a re-indexing of search to see if this works. I am still unable to create another instance within the liferay development studio
14:55 < josuebc:#liferay> bijoo_: apparently is GA1
15:39 < doged:#liferay> .convert 500000 doge btc
15:39 < doged:#liferay> ups
16:41 < josuebc:#liferay> Alright, never mind. Apparently there was an issue with custom groups. I had to undeploy a portlet that was using a custom role-mapping with a custom role then create the instance.
