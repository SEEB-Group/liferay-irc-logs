00:16 < bijoo_:#liferay> josuebc: were you able to change virtualhost?
00:17 < bijoo_:#liferay> josuebc: please pastebin full stack trace here: http://pastebin.com/
00:17 < bijoo_:#liferay> and post the link so we can review it
00:20 < bijoo_:#liferay> Reamer: were you able to resolve the issue? "[EhcacheStreamBootstrapHelpUtil] - Unable to load cache from the cluster because there was no peer response" points to clustering config error; on portal startup do you see the log messages stating that joining a cluster?
00:21 < bijoo_:#liferay> Reamer: feel free to answer later I'll check it
00:21 < bijoo_:#liferay> josuebc: worse comes to worst you can change the DB (though it's best to use the UI for this; as it may let you discover issue.)
00:22 < bijoo_:#liferay> CyberKatze: feel free to ask question; some check later.
00:23 < bijoo_:#liferay> [abeym]: did josuebc's answer satisfy this? If number of pages is too large, e.g. many hundreds or thousands, you could also do this programatically; moreover using User Groups pages, parent sites, and other ways
00:24 < bijoo_:#liferay> [abeym]: each ways has pros and cons and one question would be if you have data tied to the current page's scope (usually not, but possible)
00:24 < bijoo_:#liferay> [abeym]: that is, if for some plugin, the configuration was done to set the scope to new scope for page-level scope
00:26 < bijoo_:#liferay> Reamer: also why disabling cluster link? see some pages here : http://sysadminhub.blogspot.com/2013/05/liferay-61-cluster-configuration-using.html

03:51 < Reamer:#liferay> @bijoo i disable cluster only "ehcache.cluster.link.replication.enabled" because i will use Scenario 2 in this documentation: https://www.liferay.com/de/documentation/liferay-portal/6.2/user-guide/-/ai/liferay-clustering-liferay-portal-6-2-user-guide-20-en
03:54 < Reamer:#liferay> I see this in log file: [24.02.2015 09:53:32] [INFO] [localhost-startStop-1] [BaseReceiver] - Accepted view [test-www02-xxx-com-13873|7] [test-www02-xxx-com-13873, test-www01-xxx-com-63580]
03:55 < Reamer:#liferay> I think is a good message
04:18 < Reamer:#liferay> bijoo: thanks for your help. I test some things and it look like it's working.

11:03 < billoul:#liferay> Hi all,
11:04 < billoul:#liferay> Can some one tell me how to customize announcements portlet please. I want to add an image field how can be used to display image in the body of my announcements portlet
11:05 <@jhf:#liferay> doesn't the announcements portlet use an HTML field so you can put in whatever you want?
12:18 < bijoo_:#liferay> billoul: per jhf, is that the case you found?
12:18 < bijoo_:#liferay> Reamer: glad it's working; was it working whole time?
