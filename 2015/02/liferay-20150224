00:16 < bijoo_:#liferay> josuebc: were you able to change virtualhost?
00:17 < bijoo_:#liferay> josuebc: please pastebin full stack trace here: http://pastebin.com/
00:17 < bijoo_:#liferay> and post the link so we can review it
00:20 < bijoo_:#liferay> Reamer: were you able to resolve the issue? "[EhcacheStreamBootstrapHelpUtil] - Unable to load cache from the cluster because there was no peer response" points to clustering config error; on portal startup do you see the log messages stating that joining a cluster?
00:21 < bijoo_:#liferay> Reamer: feel free to answer later I'll check it
00:21 < bijoo_:#liferay> josuebc: worse comes to worst you can change the DB (though it's best to use the UI for this; as it may let you discover issue.)
00:22 < bijoo_:#liferay> CyberKatze: feel free to ask question; some check later.
00:23 < bijoo_:#liferay> [abeym]: did josuebc's answer satisfy this? If number of pages is too large, e.g. many hundreds or thousands, you could also do this programatically; moreover using User Groups pages, parent sites, and other ways
00:24 < bijoo_:#liferay> [abeym]: each ways has pros and cons and one question would be if you have data tied to the current page's scope (usually not, but possible)
00:24 < bijoo_:#liferay> [abeym]: that is, if for some plugin, the configuration was done to set the scope to new scope for page-level scope
00:26 < bijoo_:#liferay> Reamer: also why disabling cluster link? see some pages here : http://sysadminhub.blogspot.com/2013/05/liferay-61-cluster-configuration-using.html
