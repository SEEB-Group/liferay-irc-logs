07:11 < whop:#liferay> hi. I'm trying to customize the standard account creation (sign in portlet) by adding custom fields to the User class over the portal config.  I assumed that those fields automaticly  appear now on the account creation page but they do not though i gave the fields the permission to be visible and updatable for guests too. Is there anything i'm missing? Thanks in advance!
07:13 < modd_:#liferay> they appear in the user config, but not while account creation
07:13 < modd_:#liferay> you have to hook the jsp and add these by hand
11:18 < whop:#liferay> @modd_ thanks, worked like a charm.
14:38 < bijoo123:#liferay> josuebc: yes that or in the auth pipeline perhaps?
14:39 < bijoo123:#liferay> what's the criteria to check for this? e.g. how do you know which user's which?
14:40 < bijoo123:#liferay> josuebc: e.g. if users for ldap A have emails ending with ("@example1.com") could use that logic to check against correct repo perhaps
