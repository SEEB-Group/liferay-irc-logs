03:09 < Reamer:#liferay> bijoo: I think it's working after a click at the button "Clear Cache in whole Cluster" in admin window
03:10 < hufg:#liferay> helloo any ideas how to get the group in control panel entry class
03:10 < hufg:#liferay> in 6.1
03:10 < hufg:#liferay> looks somewhat impossible
03:14 < hufg:#liferay> i'm trying to restrict control panel entry visibility to current site owner
03:15 < hufg:#liferay> pretty zz that the permissionchecker gets thrown into the isVisible method and then you have like...nothing call every PermissionChecker method without args huh?

07:26 < jardineworks:#liferay> \o/
07:26 < jardineworks:#liferay> welcome back!
07:41 < hufg:#liferay> is staging publish still shit in 6.2? ie. unusable
07:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> hufg, I haven't done a lot with it yet. I know one of my clients is struggling with it right now, but they have a hack in place which I believe is contributing to the problem. I've never had issues with it, but, I haven't done any large scale publishing either.
07:52 < hufg:#liferay> mmh publishing has been suck for ever
07:52 < hufg:#liferay> probably still :D
07:55 < plekplek:#liferay> at least the class loader works nowadays :)
08:00 < plekplek:#liferay> have you worked on any projects with high quantity document libraries? i’m trying to figure out a maintainable workflow for a handful of administrators to share access to specific files to specific users/teams
08:03 < plekplek:#liferay> if handlign permissions for specific documents inside the library, it sounds like it would become hard to manage in the long run, especially with thousands of documents and thirty different teams
