03:10 < hufg:#liferay> helloo any ideas how to get the group in control panel entry class
03:10 < hufg:#liferay> in 6.1
03:10 < hufg:#liferay> looks somewhat impossible
03:14 < hufg:#liferay> i'm trying to restrict control panel entry visibility to current site owner
03:15 < hufg:#liferay> pretty zz that the permissionchecker gets thrown into the isVisible method and then you have like...nothing call every PermissionChecker method without args huh?

03:38 < hufg:#liferay> uhhuh ok found it
04:55 < twen:#liferay> Good morning :)
04:56 < twen:#liferay> Is this channel for devs or also users (we got a new liferay.. trying to find my way in the jungle of permissions ;) )
05:44 < billoul:#liferay> Can some one tell me how to customize announcements portlet please. I want to add an image field how can be used to display image in the body of my announcements portlet
05:45 < billoul:#liferay> the image should be stored in assets folder
05:45 < billoul:#liferay> and added into announcement table in database
05:45 < billoul:#liferay> the url of image
06:49 < plekplek:#liferay> twen: i think this is for anyone using liferay. welcome, and don’t be a stranger!
07:13 < hufg:#liferay> :D
07:13 < hufg:#liferay> jardineworks in da haus
07:25 < jardineworks:#liferay> haha
07:25 < jardineworks:#liferay> hufg, janitorial service over?
07:26 < hufg:#liferay> hehe yes back in liferay business
07:26 < jardineworks:#liferay> \o/
07:26 < jardineworks:#liferay> welcome back!
07:41 < hufg:#liferay> is staging publish still shit in 6.2? ie. unusable
07:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> hufg, I haven't done a lot with it yet. I know one of my clients is struggling with it right now, but they have a hack in place which I believe is contributing to the problem. I've never had issues with it, but, I haven't done any large scale publishing either.
07:52 < hufg:#liferay> mmh publishing has been suck for ever
07:52 < hufg:#liferay> probably still :D
07:55 < plekplek:#liferay> at least the class loader works nowadays :)
08:00 < plekplek:#liferay> have you worked on any projects with high quantity document libraries? i’m trying to figure out a maintainable workflow for a handful of administrators to share access to specific files to specific users/teams
08:03 < plekplek:#liferay> if handlign permissions for specific documents inside the library, it sounds like it would become hard to manage in the long run, especially with thousands of documents and thirty different teams
08:05 < plekplek:#liferay> maybe another way would be to create specific team folders and then share the documents into those folders. it would be easy to check what documents each team has access to. however, that seems to require access to the original file, which would result in permission management for individual documents
08:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> plekplek, do your requirements include that people from individual teams need access to other teams documents? or is it strict? Like... Team A, Team B Team C... each have access to their own documents only? or Team A may need to access all or some of Team Bs documents?
08:16 < plekplek:#liferay> jardineworks: they should only see their team specific documents, so team A sees only the documents that are shared to team A. however, there will be cases where several teams need access to same specific documents
08:18 < plekplek:#liferay> but the main idea is that users sign in and can download documents that they have been shared, and that there are a group of administrators that manage who sees what. their main task would be to add users and teams and share access to documents as well as remove access
08:27 < twen:#liferay> plekplek Thanks for the Welcoming :)
08:27 < twen:#liferay> I'm used to other channel on Freenode, but more targetted to dev
08:35 < billoul:#liferay> jardineworks, hi

08:44 < billoul:#liferay> PLEAAASE I NEED HELP
08:44 < plekplek:#liferay> twen: ah, okay :) thought i might have missed another liferay channel :)
08:44 < billoul:#liferay> LIFERAY WARIORS WHERE ARE YOU PLEASE I NEED HELP
08:44 < hufg:#liferay> :D
08:44 < hufg:#liferay> billoul: you need to relax man
08:46 < billoul:#liferay> hufg, i'm realy hopless with liferay
08:46 < billoul:#liferay> hufg, :D
08:47 < hufg:#liferay> takes some time but you will extend the existing portlet with a hook and overwrite corresponding jsp files but how to extend the db that i do not know but i've seen examples somewhere
08:47 < hufg:#liferay> you just need to google a bit
08:47 < hufg:#liferay> the hardest part of liferay is to how to find shit and once you get the hang of that it's not that bad
08:49 < billoul:#liferay> I have googled the hole of the net infortunally no exampke, no thing
08:49 < twen:#liferay> plekplek There might be others :p
08:52 < hufg:#liferay> billoul: well whats the trouble what exactly do you need for it?
08:52 < billoul:#liferay> hufg,
08:54 < hufg:#liferay> so ok you need to show the image, you need to be able to specify the image, need to store the image, need to retrieve the image
08:55 < billoul:#liferay> i have to display some news in my website, for each type (role) of subscribe poulation. well , Announcements portlet do this, but in the structur of this portlet there is no image file uplaod. I just need to add  this field and stored the url of my image in db + the image in assets folder
08:55 < billoul:#liferay> that's what i hope
08:55 < plekplek:#liferay> could that be done using custom fields?
08:55 < hufg:#liferay> you will use a hook to extend the existing portlet. now i have no clue how to extend the database and such but that's what your next how to
08:55 < billoul:#liferay> hufg, Yea exactly
08:56 < billoul:#liferay> i have extend portlet with jsp hook
08:57 < hufg:#liferay> i have no clue what then but http://www.liferay.com/community/wiki/-/wiki/Main/Wrapper+Plugins and look into service builder
08:57 < twen:#liferay> Hmm... no way to change the full pagination to a small one ? in Document & Media ?
08:57 < hufg:#liferay> or
08:57 < hufg:#liferay> or
08:58 < billoul:#liferay> hufg, or ?
08:58 < hufg:#liferay> billoul: just extend to have /documents/ url to it?
08:58 < hufg:#liferay> document library
08:58 < hufg:#liferay> no need to store
08:58 < hufg:#liferay> store image to document library
08:58 < hufg:#liferay> add link to document library
08:58 < hufg:#liferay> something like that
08:58 < hufg:#liferay> anyhow
08:59 < hufg:#liferay> anyways extending and service builder thats what i'd google
08:59 < billoul:#liferay> okey I try to do this i'm realy noob in liferay i have no idea to do this. but i will try
09:00 < billoul:#liferay> hufg, thank you
09:00 < hufg:#liferay> if you are not concerned of quality or of learning make it an ugly hack and store the image link in some other field and get it from there
09:00 < hufg:#liferay> or if you need to make it quick
09:00 < billoul:#liferay> i nedd to make it quick yea
09:00 < billoul:#liferay> need

09:36 < modd_:#liferay> jhf: new marketplace plugin submitted :)
09:36 <@jhf:#liferay> \o/
09:37 <@jhf:#liferay> I can't wait for our @LiferayApps twitter feed to be automated!!
09:37 <@jhf:#liferay> Right now it's me doing it manually
09:37 < modd_:#liferay> I think you will like it ;)
09:56 < jardineworks:#liferay> plekplek, sorry -- got pulled away. I just read your reply. And you are concerned that creating two roles -- one for general team membership and one for team managers wouldn't work?
09:57 < jardineworks:#liferay> for example... Team A (role) Team A Manager (role) ... then create user group Team A and Team A manager with the appropriate role... and then set the permissions on a top level folder to the appropriate role?
10:09 < plekplek:#liferay> jardineworks: hey, no problem. thanks for the help so far! What I’m struggling with is that we have a folder with twenty or so subfolders and a total of approximately 2000 images. That is the base document library. From there, site administrators would share certain images to certain teams. No regular team would have access to all of these images, but only those images that are hand-picked by the administrator
10:10 < plekplek:#liferay> So the admin gets a list of images that Team A should be given access to, and the admin either creates shortcuts into a Team A specific folder, or just gives view permission on those specific images in the big document folder.
10:11 < plekplek:#liferay> Problem with handling permissions for individual files is that it becomes increasingly hard to manage, especially when the access is going to be in continuous change
10:12 < plekplek:#liferay> That is what made this Team specific folder approach seem easier. An admin would create shortcuts/copy/do something that makes those specific images become available for Team A in the folder that they have access to. Then any admin could view that team’s folder and immediately see what files they have access to, and be able to make quick changes.
10:13 < jardineworks:#liferay> plekplek, agreed. The one thing I now understand that I didn't before was the fact that image01.png has a single instance where Team A and Team D might both have access to it. Right?
10:14 < plekplek:#liferay> Yes, that would be preferable, in case of any changes made to it/new versions etc.
10:15 < jardineworks:#liferay> plekplek, what about a situation where image01.png needs to be updated for Team A, but not Team D?
10:15 < jardineworks:#liferay> do you make a copoy in that case?
10:17 < plekplek:#liferay> It sounds like it would be logical to split the image into two separate in that case, and share them appropriately
10:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> plekplek, I suppose that you could end up linking to a version of a document (though I have never tried to see if you can actually do that). Hmm... It feels like the simplest option for versioning etc. might be to have you master repo with all the images. Then, as you said, have a folder for each team. When a team gets access to an image, make a COPY of it for them so that each team has their own version. For me, this means that the
10:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> files, versions, permissions etc, are all managed on a team by team basis and you don't have to worry about inheritace of permissions through sym links or anything.
10:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> but having the master repo means that the "core files" are still part of the DL, managed by Liferay, version controlled, cached, etc.
10:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> read: you're not relying on Joe being at work to upload the files from his HDD for Team M :)
10:23 < plekplek:#liferay> That would definitely be smoother. Symlinks would need management of the original document permissions, which kind of makes it impossible to manage in the long run.
10:24 < plekplek:#liferay> I guess this approach requires some work with the Documents and Media portlet, making it possible to actually copy files from one place to another. Or can it be done some other way?
10:25 < jardineworks:#liferay> plekplek, and very VERY complicated for Team A Manager to try to manage the files without affecting Team B
10:25 < jardineworks:#liferay> plekplek, (checking).
10:27 < plekplek:#liferay> Liferay Sync could have been an option, Team A Manager could copy files to the Team A folder from the main library, but it would really be preferable if all the operations could be done from within the portal itself. Otherwise it would be bound to computers that have the Sync software set up and running…
10:30 < josuebc:#liferay> Hi, I'm having an issue that Liferay is throwing an "Invalid host name" to the logs every few seconds. This is because it's behind a Load Balancer and since I'm running multiple Portal Instances I removed the ProxyName attribute from the connection. This exception doesn't modify LR behaivor at all so I'm trying to just dismiss it from the logs.
10:30 < josuebc:#liferay> I'm trying to use the Regex filter but I can't seem to get it working. Any one knows where to get an example? Thanks.
