03:10 < hufg:#liferay> helloo any ideas how to get the group in control panel entry class
03:10 < hufg:#liferay> in 6.1
03:10 < hufg:#liferay> looks somewhat impossible
03:14 < hufg:#liferay> i'm trying to restrict control panel entry visibility to current site owner
03:15 < hufg:#liferay> pretty zz that the permissionchecker gets thrown into the isVisible method and then you have like...nothing call every PermissionChecker method without args huh?

03:38 < hufg:#liferay> uhhuh ok found it
04:55 < twen:#liferay> Good morning :)
04:56 < twen:#liferay> Is this channel for devs or also users (we got a new liferay.. trying to find my way in the jungle of permissions ;) )
05:44 < billoul:#liferay> Can some one tell me how to customize announcements portlet please. I want to add an image field how can be used to display image in the body of my announcements portlet
05:45 < billoul:#liferay> the image should be stored in assets folder
05:45 < billoul:#liferay> and added into announcement table in database
05:45 < billoul:#liferay> the url of image
06:49 < plekplek:#liferay> twen: i think this is for anyone using liferay. welcome, and don’t be a stranger!
07:13 < hufg:#liferay> :D
07:13 < hufg:#liferay> jardineworks in da haus
07:25 < jardineworks:#liferay> haha
07:25 < jardineworks:#liferay> hufg, janitorial service over?
07:26 < hufg:#liferay> hehe yes back in liferay business
07:26 < jardineworks:#liferay> \o/
07:26 < jardineworks:#liferay> welcome back!
07:41 < hufg:#liferay> is staging publish still shit in 6.2? ie. unusable
07:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> hufg, I haven't done a lot with it yet. I know one of my clients is struggling with it right now, but they have a hack in place which I believe is contributing to the problem. I've never had issues with it, but, I haven't done any large scale publishing either.
07:52 < hufg:#liferay> mmh publishing has been suck for ever
07:52 < hufg:#liferay> probably still :D
07:55 < plekplek:#liferay> at least the class loader works nowadays :)
08:00 < plekplek:#liferay> have you worked on any projects with high quantity document libraries? i’m trying to figure out a maintainable workflow for a handful of administrators to share access to specific files to specific users/teams
08:03 < plekplek:#liferay> if handlign permissions for specific documents inside the library, it sounds like it would become hard to manage in the long run, especially with thousands of documents and thirty different teams
08:05 < plekplek:#liferay> maybe another way would be to create specific team folders and then share the documents into those folders. it would be easy to check what documents each team has access to. however, that seems to require access to the original file, which would result in permission management for individual documents
08:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> plekplek, do your requirements include that people from individual teams need access to other teams documents? or is it strict? Like... Team A, Team B Team C... each have access to their own documents only? or Team A may need to access all or some of Team Bs documents?
08:16 < plekplek:#liferay> jardineworks: they should only see their team specific documents, so team A sees only the documents that are shared to team A. however, there will be cases where several teams need access to same specific documents
08:18 < plekplek:#liferay> but the main idea is that users sign in and can download documents that they have been shared, and that there are a group of administrators that manage who sees what. their main task would be to add users and teams and share access to documents as well as remove access
08:27 < twen:#liferay> plekplek Thanks for the Welcoming :)
08:27 < twen:#liferay> I'm used to other channel on Freenode, but more targetted to dev

08:44 < billoul:#liferay> LIFERAY WARIORS WHERE ARE YOU PLEASE I NEED HELP
08:44 < hufg:#liferay> :D
08:44 < hufg:#liferay> billoul: you need to relax man
08:46 < billoul:#liferay> hufg, i'm realy hopless with liferay
08:46 < billoul:#liferay> hufg, :D
08:47 < hufg:#liferay> takes some time but you will extend the existing portlet with a hook and overwrite corresponding jsp files but how to extend the db that i do not know but i've seen examples somewhere
08:47 < hufg:#liferay> you just need to google a bit
08:47 < hufg:#liferay> the hardest part of liferay is to how to find shit and once you get the hang of that it's not that bad
08:49 < billoul:#liferay> I have googled the hole of the net infortunally no exampke, no thing
08:49 < twen:#liferay> plekplek There might be others :p
08:52 < hufg:#liferay> billoul: well whats the trouble what exactly do you need for it?
08:52 < billoul:#liferay> hufg,
08:54 < hufg:#liferay> so ok you need to show the image, you need to be able to specify the image, need to store the image, need to retrieve the image
08:55 < billoul:#liferay> i have to display some news in my website, for each type (role) of subscribe poulation. well , Announcements portlet do this, but in the structur of this portlet there is no image file uplaod. I just need to add  this field and stored the url of my image in db + the image in assets folder
08:55 < billoul:#liferay> that's what i hope
08:55 < plekplek:#liferay> could that be done using custom fields?
08:55 < hufg:#liferay> you will use a hook to extend the existing portlet. now i have no clue how to extend the database and such but that's what your next how to
08:55 < billoul:#liferay> hufg, Yea exactly
08:56 < billoul:#liferay> i have extend portlet with jsp hook
08:57 < hufg:#liferay> i have no clue what then but http://www.liferay.com/community/wiki/-/wiki/Main/Wrapper+Plugins and look into service builder
08:57 < twen:#liferay> Hmm... no way to change the full pagination to a small one ? in Document & Media ?
08:57 < hufg:#liferay> or
08:57 < hufg:#liferay> or
08:58 < billoul:#liferay> hufg, or ?
08:58 < hufg:#liferay> billoul: just extend to have /documents/ url to it?
