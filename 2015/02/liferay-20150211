10:34 < CyberKatze:#liferay> Hallo. Can someone help me to tell, how can i add my own page in theme?  For example : custom contact page?
10:44 <@jhf:#liferay> CyberKatze: themes are really only for defining the look and feel of a site, not adding specific pages
10:45 <@jhf:#liferay> instead, you should create a Liferay Site and then add a page called "Contact" and then you can put web content on that page.
10:45 <@jhf:#liferay> actually I take that back
10:45 <@jhf:#liferay> you CAN create pages in a theme, but they are page "templates" so that when someone installs your theme, they will get a set of pages you define.
10:45 <@jhf:#liferay> is that what you're trying to do? like the Zoe themes on the marketplace?
10:45 < CyberKatze:#liferay> :(
10:46 <@jhf:#liferay> For example
10:46 <@jhf:#liferay> If I install this theme: https://www.liferay.com/marketplace/-/mp/application/15849867
10:46 <@jhf:#liferay> then when I create a new site using that Theme, I will get all those pages you see in the screenshots ("Home", "Reservations", etc...)
10:46 <@jhf:#liferay> is that what you want to do?
10:46 < CyberKatze:#liferay> I try to Design own contact page. . And crested custom portlet for this..
10:51 < CyberKatze:#liferay> Thanks for help!
14:04 < bijoo_2:#liferay> First non-liferay project in 6 years time; :( . When they upgrade, I'll recommend it though; and for my personal, Liferay for life!
14:05 < bijoo_2:#liferay> Who knows maybe I'll find Liferay just yet; it is not done deal for DC yet.

15:22 < Guest57639:#liferay> hi
15:24 < Guest57639:#liferay> i have one question, a colleague suggested Liferay portal as application framework for java development, but i think it is not suitable for that in general
15:29 < mbohn:#liferay> now i wonder if hes right or i am right
