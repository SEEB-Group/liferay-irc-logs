10:49 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey rotty3000 can I as you an architecture question?
10:49 <@rotty3000:#liferay> sure
10:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> rotty3000, if I have a portlet where I can configured a scheduler. My scheduler fires and runs. The listener for that scheduler check a table and pulls down a series of "jobs" -- basically reports that have been requested. If I loop over the request and create a "Message" to a custom destination for each job, will they, by default, be executed in parallel?
10:56 <@rotty3000:#liferay> reading..
10:57 <@rotty3000:#liferay> if they are fired as individual jobs, then yes they should be executed in parallel
10:58 <@rotty3000:#liferay> wait...
10:59 <@rotty3000:#liferay> so you have a scheduled listener which is collecting some form of job?
10:59 <@rotty3000:#liferay> ok, I think I see
