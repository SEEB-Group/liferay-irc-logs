04:48 < jbub:#liferay> hello, is it possible to use "liferay-portlet:runtime" in portlet, i know it works in theme, if not, what would be the way to embed/include portlet in existing portlet ? thank you very much for any help (im using spring+freemarker)
10:30 < vaor:#liferay> Hello. Is it possible to add content to my liferay CE thanks to command line, not using the user interface, to automate tasks.
10:34 < vaor:#liferay> anyone online please?
11:10 < modd_:#liferay> hi there. anyone knows how to adjust the print layout css of the portal?
11:27 < jardineworks_:#liferay> vaor, It is ... you can access a number of "services" remotely using SOAP or JSON
11:29 < vaor:#liferay> jardineworks_:  would you mind redirecting me to the documentation page of what you are mentionning please ?
11:33 < jardineworks_:#liferay> vaor, lemme see if I can find something --
11:33 < vaor:#liferay> jardineworks_: thank you
11:34 < jardineworks_:#liferay> vaor, Check this out http://www.liferay.com/documentation/liferay-portal/6.1/development/-/ai/json-web-services
11:34 < jardineworks_:#liferay> it explains all the JSON-WS stuff
11:34 < jardineworks_:#liferay> probably simplest for you to run curl operations.
11:34 < jardineworks_:#liferay> use /api/jsonwws will show you all available services
11:34 < jardineworks_:#liferay> eg. localhost:8080/api/jsonws
11:36 < vaor:#liferay> Thank you I'm going to read that.
11:42 < jardineworks_:#liferay> vaor, you can see the SOAP ones if you use /api/axis
11:49 < jardineworks_:#liferay> vaor, for eg. http://localhost:8080/api/axis/Portlet_Journal_JournalArticleService?wsdl
11:50 < vaor:#liferay> the only side point is that there is no real split between command lines actions and user interface web configuration
11:51 < vaor:#liferay> using curl to performs actions on the server seems uncommon
12:27 < Naenyn:#liferay> Anyone know if Rotty still visits? I haven't seen him in a while...
13:28 < jardineworks_:#liferay> Naenyn, I haven
13:28 < jardineworks_:#liferay> 't seen him in ages
13:28 < jardineworks_:#liferay> probably months to be honest
13:29 < jardineworks_:#liferay> I think he is pretty buys with 7.0
16:07 < juan__:#liferay> Hello Guys :)
16:08 < juan__:#liferay> i'm having some troubles adding MBCategories through jasonws API
16:09 < juan__:#liferay> if I use the following javascript method for adding a MBCategory:
16:09 < juan__:#liferay> Liferay.Service(
16:09 < juan__:#liferay>   '/mbcategory/add-category',
16:09 < juan__:#liferay>   {
16:09 < juan__:#liferay>     userId: ,
16:09 < juan__:#liferay>     parentCategoryId: ,
16:09 < juan__:#liferay>     name: '',
16:09 < juan__:#liferay>     description: ''
16:09 < juan__:#liferay>   },
16:09 < juan__:#liferay>   function(obj) {
16:09 < juan__:#liferay>     console.log(obj);
16:09 < juan__:#liferay>   }
16:09 < juan__:#liferay> );
16:09 < juan__:#liferay> How can I choose the respective groupId?
16:10 < juan__:#liferay> because a server ERROR trows something like this: com.liferay.portal.NoSuchGroupException: No Group exists with the primary key 0
16:11 < juan__:#liferay> any idea, please :)
17:08 < jardineworks_:#liferay> juan__, use the serviceContext parameter
17:08 < jardineworks_:#liferay> p_auth String
17:08 < jardineworks_:#liferay> authentication token used to validate the request
17:08 < jardineworks_:#liferay> userId long
17:08 < jardineworks_:#liferay> parentCategoryId long
17:08 < jardineworks_:#liferay> name java.lang.String
17:08 < jardineworks_:#liferay> description java.lang.String
17:08 < jardineworks_:#liferay> serviceContext com.liferay.portal.service.ServiceContext
17:08 < jardineworks_:#liferay> the last one allows you to specify companyid, groupid, etc.
18:05 < juan__:#liferay> jardineworks_, thank you very much!! heheh :) you save me! I have expend almost three days and you gave me the rigth answer hehehe :)
18:06 < juan__:#liferay> just for reference, ("serviceContext.scopeGroupId", "10182") was the solution :)
18:06 < juan__:#liferay> thanks! :)
