04:41 < Axxell:#liferay> Hello... Problem: Before my upgrade to liferay 6.2ga3 from 6.1 when i added a webcontent via an assetpublisher, the configured categories of that assetpublisher would automaticly be put in the new articles category selection, this is not working anymore, anyone know what could be wrong and how to fix it?
06:30 < bijoo_2:#liferay> josuebc: checked the liferay-display.xml for the portlet? If category is hidden, it will not be in the Add menu; also it may have specified to be in the Control Panel or set as System-wide portlet (all layouts) in the liferay-portlet.xml.
06:31 < bijoo_2:#liferay> Axxell: there were some API changes from 6.1 to 6.2 but as long as you didn't have custom code involved with the Asset Publisher (e.g. you didn't deploy a hook or override it's actions via your or another 6.1 plugin) you should be fine
06:32 < bijoo_2:#liferay> Axxell: Did you check the configuratino to make sure it is still configured to add those categories and such?
07:05 < Axxell:#liferay> bijoo_2: it seems to it sets the category on if assetpublishers category filtering is set to "ALL" and not "ANY"
07:06 < Axxell:#liferay> was wondering about serving static content via apache.. why not serve the webapps dir for certain stuff?
07:07 < Axxell:#liferay> like css, js?
07:07 < Axxell:#liferay> ie point apache httpd to tomcats webapps dir unmount mod_jk for specifik portlets css and js?
