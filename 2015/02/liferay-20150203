10:00 < jardineworks_:#liferay> jhf, \o/!
10:00 <@jhf:#liferay> Mr. JardineWorks!
10:00 <@jhf:#liferay> isn't that french for Garden?
10:01 < jardineworks_:#liferay> pretty close .. jardin is garden.
10:01 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah without the 'e'
10:01 <@jhf:#liferay> I thought so. those two years of high school francais really paying off
10:01 < jardineworks_:#liferay> my dad is scottish and the scottish and the french we're pretty friendly against the english for some time :)
10:01 <@jhf:#liferay> mais oui!
10:01 < jardineworks_:#liferay> hahah
10:02 < jardineworks_:#liferay> but there are some that say the origin is norse because of when it showed up in Scotland... around 1103 A.D
10:02 <@jhf:#liferay> oooohhhhh norse! vikings! gnomes and trolls!
10:02 < jardineworks_:#liferay> much more exciting than just being from france.
10:02 < jardineworks_:#liferay> but if I were a betting man, I'd guess french
10:03 < jardineworks_:#liferay> anyway!
10:03 < jardineworks_:#liferay> quick one for you :)
10:04 < jardineworks_:#liferay> I'm wandering into the world of freemarker. Outside of the freemaker website... are there any good resources for using it specifically with LR?
10:05 <@jhf:#liferay> hmmm
10:05 <@jhf:#liferay> good question!
10:06 <@jhf:#liferay> when I made the transition from VM to FM I mostly relied on FM docs. But there are a few blogs on liferay.com, most specifically that show how to use Liferay taglibs from FM
10:06 <@jhf:#liferay> and there was a few blogs from Barrie Selack last year I think showing some advanced FM usage (specically with macros)
10:07 <@jhf:#liferay> https://www.liferay.com/web/bselack/blog/-/blogs/using-freemarker-in-liferay-web-content-wcm-
10:08 < jardineworks_:#liferay> checking..
10:10 < jardineworks_:#liferay> cool -- that looks useful. I was expecting a link to your own blog lol... but ok :)
10:10 <@jhf:#liferay> hahahahaha
10:10 <@jhf:#liferay> barrie is better at FM than I am
10:10 <@jhf:#liferay> but IMO, the biggest benefits are
10:10 <@jhf:#liferay> 1 - no silent errors when you screw up (and you will)
10:10 <@jhf:#liferay> 2 - using taglibs
10:10 <@jhf:#liferay> 3 - builtins !!
10:11 <@jhf:#liferay> oh and 4 - looping constructs are better (there is a 'continue' and 'break' I think)
10:11 <@jhf:#liferay> oh and 5 - metaprogramming
10:11 <@jhf:#liferay> oh and 6 - it's NOT velocity
10:11 < jardineworks_:#liferay> 2 and 3 is why I am leaning towards it. 1 is the one giving me all my headaches at the moment
10:11 < jardineworks_:#liferay> that and .. frustratingly... the "editor" in LR is tripping me up.
10:12 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah........... I don't use it for more than 'token' templates
10:12 <@jhf:#liferay> for real templates, I use intellij
10:12 <@jhf:#liferay> (but don't tell anyone)
10:12 <@jhf:#liferay> whoops.. did I say that out loud?
10:12 < jardineworks_:#liferay> for example, I have an ADT template. I use the ${renderRequest} object from the left hand area, then use the intellisense to choose getAttribute('myvar')
10:12 <@jhf:#liferay> the ONLY reason I don't use it though is that it doesn't do auto-complete for dynamic variabels
10:12 < jardineworks_:#liferay> but that gives me an error!
10:13 <@jhf:#liferay> renderRequest, the one in ADT templates, isn't a "real" request object
10:13 <@jhf:#liferay> it's a hashmap IIRC
10:13 <@jhf:#liferay> I think you have to use get('myvar')
10:13 < jardineworks_:#liferay> right -- Krystov or the forums helped me witht hat
10:13 < jardineworks_:#liferay> but!
10:14 < jardineworks_:#liferay> why does it give me the intellisense as though it were a real object! BLAST YOU!
10:14 <@jhf:#liferay> the ADT editor ?
10:15  * jhf:#liferay fires it up
10:15 <@jhf:#liferay> also, I love that noun 'intellisense'
10:15 <@jhf:#liferay> it sounds cool. does Liferay have that?
10:16 < jardineworks_:#liferay> it did for me
10:16 <@jhf:#liferay> omg
10:16 <@jhf:#liferay> somehow I have all my local Liferay's en francais
10:16 < jardineworks_:#liferay> haha
10:16 <@jhf:#liferay> Mot de passe ? is that like apple sauce?
10:16 < jardineworks_:#liferay> 2 years!
10:17 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah I was helping someone via email with an issue, so I had to put my portal in french to make an animated gif explaining something to them
10:17 <@jhf:#liferay> and now it no goes back
10:17 < jardineworks_:#liferay> haha -- depends on whether or not you use @pp13sau(3 as a password
10:24 <@jhf:#liferay> well I take that back jardineworks_
10:24 <@jhf:#liferay> ${renderRequest.getAttribute("CURRENT_URL")!"dunno"}
10:24 <@jhf:#liferay> that seems to work
10:24 <@jhf:#liferay> and gets me the CURRENT_URL
10:24 <@jhf:#liferay> changing CURRENT_URL to some unknown attribute gets me "dunno"
10:24 <@jhf:#liferay> (this is in a blogs ADT)
10:25 < jardineworks_:#liferay> what if you don't use the !"dunno"
10:25 < jardineworks_:#liferay> ?
10:25 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah that fails because the expression is evaluated to null
10:25 <@jhf:#liferay> and FM can't "print" that
10:25 < jardineworks_:#liferay> I see
10:26 < jardineworks_:#liferay> if I did an #assign first... and then printed the thing I assigned it to?
10:26 < jardineworks_:#liferay> or used the getter util to get a string?
10:28 <@jhf:#liferay> testing..
10:29 <@jhf:#liferay> same
10:29 <@jhf:#liferay> well.. it says
10:29 <@jhf:#liferay> renderRequest.getAttribute("CURRENT_URL12") is undefined.
10:29 <@jhf:#liferay> It cannot be assigned to foo
10:29 <@jhf:#liferay> (when evaluating <#assign foo = renderRequest.getAttribute("CURRENT_URL12") />
10:29 <@jhf:#liferay>  
10:29 <@jhf:#liferay> this is the statement I tried: <#assign foo = renderRequest.getAttribute("CURRENT_URL12") />
10:29 < jardineworks_:#liferay> hmm -- so I should always use the ![default value] ??
10:29 < jardineworks_:#liferay> ah
10:29 < jardineworks_:#liferay> but the getter util might work
10:30 < jardineworks_:#liferay> as long as I know the value is a string for example
10:30 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah if you wrap getterutil with everything it might
10:30 <@jhf:#liferay> <#assign foo = getterUtil.getString(renderRequest.getAttribute("CURRENT_URL12")) />
10:30 <@jhf:#liferay> the problem is that you'll get empty string for $foo
10:30 <@jhf:#liferay> which gets you back to velocity. or worse.
10:31 <@jhf:#liferay> because in velocity sometimnes it would assign the literal string value of the statement to the var
10:31 <@jhf:#liferay> which would give you a clue about what's wrong
10:32 < jardineworks_:#liferay> hmm so I guess the ! to get a default value is the best option
10:32 <@jhf:#liferay> jardineworks: read http://freemarker.org/docs/app_faq.html#faq_picky_about_missing_vars
10:33 <@jhf:#liferay> "Most scripting languages and template languages are rather forgiving with missing variables (and with null-s), and they usually treat them as empty string and/or 0 and/or logical false. This behavior has several problems"
10:33 <@jhf:#liferay> AMEN
10:33 < jardineworks_:#liferay> lol
10:33 <@jhf:#liferay> lol
10:33 <@jhf:#liferay> "Just because it's not know what's your current balance at your bank, can we just say it's $0? Just because it is not known if a patient has penicillin allergy, we can just say he/she doesn't have it"
10:34 <@jhf:#liferay> it says to use ! if you really want to
10:35 <@jhf:#liferay> but "If you use them too often, try to rethink your data-model"
10:35 <@jhf:#liferay> ALSO
10:35 <@jhf:#liferay> there is a hidden method to get at static methods
10:35 <@jhf:#liferay> read the comments of https://issues.liferay.com/browse/LPS-50931
10:36 <@jhf:#liferay> but here's the shortcut: <#assign fields = staticUtil["com.liferay.portlet.dynamicdatamapping.storage.StorageEngineUtil"].getFields(fileEntryMetadata.getDDMStorageId()) />
10:36 <@jhf:#liferay> (this is an example of calling the static method "getFields" of the com.liferay.portlet.dynamicdatamapping.storage.StorageEngineUtil class
10:36 <@jhf:#liferay> it uses 'staticUtil' which is secretly injected for you in the context of Freemarker evaluation in Liferay
10:36 <@jhf:#liferay> staticUtil is part of this set of handy freemarker tools we include
10:37 <@jhf:#liferay> rotty was instrumental in getting them into LR 6.0
10:37 <@jhf:#liferay> see https://issues.liferay.com/browse/LPS-15913
10:37 <@jhf:#liferay> for a little history lesson
10:38 <@jhf:#liferay> somewhere in LR source code you can find out exactly which objects are avilable to you (they should ALL be listed in the template palette but I don't think they all are)
10:39 <@jhf:#liferay> you can also do things like <#assign DATE = staticUtil["java.util.Calendar"].DATE>
10:39 <@jhf:#liferay> 4	
10:40 <@jhf:#liferay> see https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/blob/e1046f326d246a8b23e8e98f7aebb14e2a655719/modules/portal/portal-template-freemarker/src/com/liferay/portal/template/freemarker/FreeMarkerTemplateContextHelper.java for the source that sticks those helpers in there.
10:40 < jardineworks_:#liferay> no they aren't all there... but I think the intellisense in the browser shows them
10:40 <@jhf:#liferay> ah yeahj
10:40 <@jhf:#liferay> ${ and then the autocomplete shows them
10:40 <@jhf:#liferay> that's cool
10:41 <@jhf:#liferay> my ONLY remaining complaint is if I do something like <#assign foo = someThing() /
10:41 <@jhf:#liferay> >
10:41 <@jhf:#liferay> then I can't do $foo. (and then wait for the automcplete0
10:41 <@jhf:#liferay> it's not dynamic
10:41 <@jhf:#liferay> it only autocompletes on classes it has previously been taught about
10:41 <@jhf:#liferay> whereas intellij IDEA will do it properly
10:47 <@jhf:#liferay> wow, I am really starting to dislike Eclipse
10:48 <@jhf:#liferay> we are going to re-start the dev.life sessions in 2 weeks - starting with an IntelliJ session :)
10:48 <@jhf:#liferay> in the meantime - pro tip: don't press Alt-S (when on a Mac) when using Eclipse
10:49 <@jhf:#liferay> It generates this: ß
10:49 <@jhf:#liferay> instead of saving the file
11:05 < jardineworks_:#liferay> LOL
11:05 < jardineworks_:#liferay> I would welcome the intellij session... I have it on my machine but havent had a chance to play with it. Last time I used it they were on version 4!
11:05 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah. and eclipse syntax check doens't catch it in javascript unless you are using 'strict' mode
11:05 <@jhf:#liferay> wow
11:05 <@jhf:#liferay> they are on version 14 now
11:06 < jardineworks_:#liferay> it was about 10 years ago -- so that makes sense
11:06 < jardineworks_:#liferay> and I loved it... but I was forced to use eclipse
11:07 < jardineworks_:#liferay> I hated eclipse at the time but I have developed more of a love hate relationship.
11:07 < jardineworks_:#liferay> the plugins for LR go a long way towards the love part.
11:08 <@jhf:#liferay> you know that jean-luc picard meme picture
11:09 <@jhf:#liferay> "WHY THE F---" .. and then something funny
11:09 <@jhf:#liferay> ?
11:09 < jardineworks_:#liferay> I don't. Link?
11:10 <@jhf:#liferay> it's the "Annoyed Picard" meme: http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/annoyed-picard (NSFW - language)
11:10 <@jhf:#liferay> especially look for the "Notable Examples" section
11:10 <@jhf:#liferay> I have several of those every day.
11:10 <@jhf:#liferay> with eclipse
11:10 <@jhf:#liferay> in fact I'm gonna make a new one now
11:14 <@jhf:#liferay> http://imgur.com/a/Nq5qa (NSFW)
11:18 <@jhf:#liferay> anyone here interested in getting a sneak peak of the new Liferay Sync 3?
11:27 < jardineworks_:#liferay> jhf, LMAO
11:28 <@jhf:#liferay> it also routinely misses stuff in JSPs and sometimes reports oddball errors that aren't really errors at all
11:30 < jardineworks_:#liferay> seriously man? JSP error validation in eclipse is a POS
11:30 < jardineworks_:#liferay> it always has been
11:31 < jardineworks_:#liferay> a 3 tiered system of includes confuses is
11:31 <@jhf:#liferay> and using the searchcontainer
11:31 <@jhf:#liferay> it reports some weird errors
11:31 <@jhf:#liferay> also, sometimes I have to close the file or quit/restart eclipse to clear errors
11:31 <@jhf:#liferay> which is very odd
11:31 < jardineworks_:#liferay> so /common/init.js, /myportlet/init.jsp (which include common) and then view.jsp (which includes myportlet.init.jsp) .. and references to the /common one are usually flagged as error
11:31 < jardineworks_:#liferay> s
11:31 <@jhf:#liferay> hah
11:31 <@jhf:#liferay> nice.
11:33 < jardineworks_:#liferay> as soon as someone says to me "I think I have a problem... eclipse is saying .." I cut them off and say, eclipse is wrong. Deploy it and tell me what the runtime says
11:33 < jardineworks_:#liferay> :)
11:33 <@jhf:#liferay> hahaha
11:33 <@jhf:#liferay> sigh
11:43 < Naenyn:#liferay> jhf: What happened to rotty3000?
11:43 <@jhf:#liferay> hahaha.. I asked him last year on dev.life when he's returning to IRC :)
11:44 <@jhf:#liferay> he said "soon" so I hope he shows up. he's been elected to some high ranking positon in the OSGi Alliance now, so we might not be cool enough to hang out with anymore
11:44 <@jhf:#liferay> http://www.osgi.org/About/BoardAndOfficers
11:44 <@jhf:#liferay> he's on the Board of Directors
11:44 <@jhf:#liferay> Mr. Big Shot Rotty3000
11:44 <@jhf:#liferay> notice everyone else on the BOD has a PhD :)
11:44 <@jhf:#liferay> err.. almost everyone else.
11:45 <@jhf:#liferay> so he's gotta bring his A game
11:45 <@jhf:#liferay> Naenyn: you should email him and tell him to come back!! :)
11:48 < Naenyn:#liferay> jhf: what's his email addy? =]
11:48 <@jhf:#liferay> it's on that osgi page!
11:48 < Naenyn:#liferay> ah
11:50 < jardineworks_:#liferay> jhf, totally going to get him a "I'm kind of a big deal" tshirt :)
11:50 < jardineworks_:#liferay> "I'm kind of a big deal. PhD's know me."
11:51 < Naenyn:#liferay> hmm.. blog.. twitter..
11:52 <@jhf:#liferay> hahaha
11:52 < Naenyn:#liferay> ah hah
11:52 < Naenyn:#liferay> found it. =]
11:52 < Naenyn:#liferay> ... and should have guessed it.
11:57 < Naenyn:#liferay> Emailed! ;) annnd its meeting time.. woo.
11:57  * Naenyn:#liferay scampers off to a conference room.

12:03 <@jhf:#liferay> \o/
12:03 <@jhf:#liferay> rotty3000: !
12:04 <@rotty3000:#liferay> :)
12:04 <@rotty3000:#liferay> hey dude!
12:05 <@rotty3000:#liferay> been too long!
12:05 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah!
12:05 <@jhf:#liferay> also, congrats on the OSGi thing - so now your email addr is public
12:05 <@jhf:#liferay> ;-)
12:05 <@rotty3000:#liferay> yeah :)
12:06 <@jhf:#liferay> http://www.osgi.org/About/BoardAndOfficers
12:07 <@jhf:#liferay> also - I see a lot of PhD's on there. we expect great things.
12:07 <@rotty3000:#liferay> yeah, it's kind of a policy thing
12:07 <@rotty3000:#liferay> haha
12:08 <@rotty3000:#liferay> it's a strange new world that's for sure
12:08 <@rotty3000:#liferay> but interesting so far
12:09 <@jhf:#liferay> hahaha.. it reminds me of something. oh yeah! Rush's 2112. You know where the guy discovers music and goes in front of the priests of the temples of syrinx
12:09 <@jhf:#liferay> or Superman with the "guilty... guilty... guilty" jury.
12:09 <@jhf:#liferay> I just have these visions of you sitting around these robed and halo'd OSGi gods
12:09 <@jhf:#liferay> and you're like cracking open a beer and saying "cheers, eh"
12:10 <@rotty3000:#liferay> hahaha
12:10 <@rotty3000:#liferay> that's incredibly close to truth
12:10 <@jhf:#liferay> hahahaha
12:17 < modd:#liferay> any css guru here?
12:19 < modd:#liferay> I could need a hint about the print layout of web content
12:37 <@jhf:#liferay> hey modd saw your message..
12:37 <@jhf:#liferay> i'm digging around.
12:37 <@jhf:#liferay> i'm sure it's possible.
12:46 < modd:#liferay> long time ago, I think I've read something about a print.css, but I cannot find it :\
12:46 < modd:#liferay> @media print does not work as far as I can see
12:51 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah I've never investigated what happens when you enable Print and click it
12:51 <@jhf:#liferay> it does something. that's probably overrideable.
12:51 <@jhf:#liferay> still digging (and my wife's texting me)
12:51 <@jhf:#liferay> (which is distracting me - don't tell her that I said that)
