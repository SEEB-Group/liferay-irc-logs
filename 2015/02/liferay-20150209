02:30 < plekplek:#liferay> is there a configuration for letting liferay fetch data through https? i have a portlet that uses php, that fetches a file and it is giving me “Unrecognized SSL message, plaintext connection?”

04:54 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Hi everyone. Been a while since I last peeked in here. ;)
04:55 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> In case anyone is around: I have a problem with a staged community. I can't delete a certain page from live. I get a success message but the page stays in place. I can also still see it in the database.
04:55 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Is this a known problem? Google didn't reveal an answer. :-(
06:49 < Axxell:#liferay> hi, question: isnt assetpublisher in LR6.2 supposed to be able to share content from different sites?
06:49 < Axxell:#liferay> The problem is that i cant see the categories of that site when i try to publish content from another site..
07:01 < modd_:#liferay> AFAIR, it works only, if these sites are parent sites of the current and have sharing activated...and even then it's buggy
07:46 < Axxell:#liferay> modd_: do you know where in the assetpublisher jsp files the categories are set? having trouble finding them.. in init we have: long[] groupIds = AssetPublisherUtil.getGroupIds(portletPreferences, scopeGroupId, layout); long[] siteGroupIds = getSiteGroupIds(groupIds);
07:47 < Axxell:#liferay> mod_: but scopegroupId is not defined there
07:50 < modd_:#liferay> scopegroupid is the currents site group id
07:51 < modd_:#liferay> it's defined in one of the generic jsp includes
08:35 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> hi there
08:37 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> we're facing a problem with short url. We create a new page which has a subdirectory in its path : [domain]/mysubfolder/page. We can't access this page until we disable the virtual host in the community parameters. Anyone know how to access this page with the virtual host on ? Thanks
09:10 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> anyone :(

11:26 < SaraI_S:#liferay> hi
11:28 < SaraI_S:#liferay> I have an instalation of liferay 5.2.3 which includes the fckeditor 6.2.3. A client of mine has reported that that version of fckeditor allow people to upload malicious files to the server, is that true? how can I check it? Thank you
11:40 < SaraI_S:#liferay> people sleep :)
15:57 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, you around for a threading question?

18:55 < bijoo_:#liferay> plekplek: container handles the protocol bit; or perhaps web server if using one; so would need some more information there.
