02:30 < plekplek:#liferay> is there a configuration for letting liferay fetch data through https? i have a portlet that uses php, that fetches a file and it is giving me “Unrecognized SSL message, plaintext connection?”

04:54 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Hi everyone. Been a while since I last peeked in here. ;)
04:55 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> In case anyone is around: I have a problem with a staged community. I can't delete a certain page from live. I get a success message but the page stays in place. I can also still see it in the database.
04:55 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Is this a known problem? Google didn't reveal an answer. :-(
06:49 < Axxell:#liferay> hi, question: isnt assetpublisher in LR6.2 supposed to be able to share content from different sites?
06:49 < Axxell:#liferay> The problem is that i cant see the categories of that site when i try to publish content from another site..
07:01 < modd_:#liferay> AFAIR, it works only, if these sites are parent sites of the current and have sharing activated...and even then it's buggy
07:46 < Axxell:#liferay> modd_: do you know where in the assetpublisher jsp files the categories are set? having trouble finding them.. in init we have: long[] groupIds = AssetPublisherUtil.getGroupIds(portletPreferences, scopeGroupId, layout); long[] siteGroupIds = getSiteGroupIds(groupIds);
07:47 < Axxell:#liferay> mod_: but scopegroupId is not defined there
07:50 < modd_:#liferay> scopegroupid is the currents site group id
07:51 < modd_:#liferay> it's defined in one of the generic jsp includes
