05:19 < scribe:#liferay> Hey guys.  I have a few critical bugs with GA4 that I know have been fix since the release.  Does anyone know if a GA5 will be released anytime soon or should I try to build something stable from source?
05:21 < dmarks:#liferay> As I remember, James Falkner said that there will be a 6.2 GA-Release every 6 month, until Liferay 7 is released.
