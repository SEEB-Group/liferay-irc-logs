05:19 < scribe:#liferay> Hey guys.  I have a few critical bugs with GA4 that I know have been fix since the release.  Does anyone know if a GA5 will be released anytime soon or should I try to build something stable from source?
05:21 < dmarks:#liferay> As I remember, James Falkner said that there will be a 6.2 GA-Release every 6 month, until Liferay 7 is released.

05:25 < scribe:#liferay> dmarks, thanks.  I wonder if they are counting from the GA3 release or GA4 release.  GA3 was mid Jan but they found a fatal bug which caused them to release GA4 a few months later.  If from GA3 then we're due, if from GA4 then we're still a couple months out.
05:27 < dmarks:#liferay> GA4 was released earlier because GA3 contained some serious bugs.
05:38 < scribe:#liferay> GA4 has some serious bugs too :)
05:38 < dmarks:#liferay> which bugs are you facing?
