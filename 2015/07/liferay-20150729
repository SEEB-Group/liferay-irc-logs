05:19 < scribe:#liferay> Hey guys.  I have a few critical bugs with GA4 that I know have been fix since the release.  Does anyone know if a GA5 will be released anytime soon or should I try to build something stable from source?
05:21 < dmarks:#liferay> As I remember, James Falkner said that there will be a 6.2 GA-Release every 6 month, until Liferay 7 is released.

05:25 < scribe:#liferay> dmarks, thanks.  I wonder if they are counting from the GA3 release or GA4 release.  GA3 was mid Jan but they found a fatal bug which caused them to release GA4 a few months later.  If from GA3 then we're due, if from GA4 then we're still a couple months out.
05:27 < dmarks:#liferay> GA4 was released earlier because GA3 contained some serious bugs.
05:38 < scribe:#liferay> GA4 has some serious bugs too :)
05:38 < dmarks:#liferay> which bugs are you facing?
05:39 < scribe:#liferay> https://issues.liferay.com/browse/LPS-56190
05:44 < dmarks:#liferay> Sounds like a serious bug. I was never facing this issue in GA 4.
05:46 < dmarks:#liferay> If this problem is a production problem, you could have a look at the commits in that issue. Then try to create a hook or an ext plugin which fixes the files.
05:55 < scribe:#liferay> Thanks dmarks.  I might take you up on that if we do indeed need to wait for a couple more months.  Our admins are going crazy not being able to look up users.  They can work around the issue now most of the time because the usually simply want to grant roles and they can look up the Role and add members to the Role.  Thank for the chat.  Off to lunch.
10:56 < modd_:#liferay> scribe: you could try to set users.search.with.index=false in your portal properties
10:56 < scribe:#liferay> really?
10:57 < scribe:#liferay> modd_, never heard of this.  I will try when the traffic on our site is low and I can restart.
10:57 < modd:#liferay> it has a downside though
10:58 < modd:#liferay> you can't search for expando values anymore
