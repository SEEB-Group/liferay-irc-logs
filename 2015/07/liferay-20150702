03:07 < Axxell:#liferay> Hey guys
03:08 < Axxell:#liferay> im trying to find out if its possible to make assetpublisher change its sorting, by a parameter in the url? or something of that nature? I want to do an ADT that would have links where you would change the sorting of the assets
03:09 < Axxell:#liferay> ive done it before by putting the assetpublisher results in an array, then sorting that array, but thats kinda suboptimal
