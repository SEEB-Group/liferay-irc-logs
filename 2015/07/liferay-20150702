03:07 < Axxell:#liferay> Hey guys
03:08 < Axxell:#liferay> im trying to find out if its possible to make assetpublisher change its sorting, by a parameter in the url? or something of that nature? I want to do an ADT that would have links where you would change the sorting of the assets
03:09 < Axxell:#liferay> ive done it before by putting the assetpublisher results in an array, then sorting that array, but thats kinda suboptimal
04:59 < nenotlep:#liferay> Hey. I'm trying to build a plugin with a few portles and a service, with maven. I first just generated a basic service that made generated a "Foo" entity; FooModelImpl etc files. Then I changed my service.xml and did "mvn clean liferay:build-service" and it generated new classes, but did not delete the old "Foo" stuff! How can I tell it to remove all generated things before regenerating?
