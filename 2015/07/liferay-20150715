07:02 < hufg:#liferay> ahh hello
07:02 < hufg:#liferay> filtering asset publisher asset by multiple fields is not possible?
07:04 < hufg:#liferay> jardineworks: any chances you have stumbled upon user permissions by page ie. user actions should be contained to certain pages within a site
07:04 < hufg:#liferay> ? :D
07:07 < hufg:#liferay> there are some page level permission but they work all wrong
07:12 < hufg:#liferay> to answer my own question it's not possible to use multiple field filters in asset publisher
07:12 < hufg:#liferay> sucks
07:13 < hufg:#liferay> imo the liferay motto is "almost but not quite"
07:13 < hufg:#liferay> the features are there but not quite well rounded enough hehe
08:13 < jardineworks:#liferay> hufg, hey -- user permissions by page. You mean the same portlet (for example) on Page A and Page B but the permissions for said portlet different for the user on each page?
08:34 < hufg:#liferay> no, more like let's say site membership permissions you can edit etc add pages
08:34 < hufg:#liferay> on the site
