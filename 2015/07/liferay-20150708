16:20 < scribe:#liferay> Hey guys.  We have an Activities portlet on the welcome page of our site and it should only be displayed for site members.  I removed view permission for guests and this certainly hides the Activities portlet when someone is not logged in to the portal, but it also shows a red error, "You do not have the roles required to access this portlet."  I would simply like to not show the portlet, not report an error.  Any ideas?
