00:17 < loscar:#liferay> hello
03:55 < modd_:#liferay> hey. I'm trying to update a marketplace portlet but after uploading it just says "Eligible Liferay versions were not found in liferay-plugin-package.properties". any ideas?
03:56 < modd_:#liferay> property -> liferay-versions=6.2.0+,6.2.10+
03:57 < modd_:#liferay> when changing 6.2.0 to 6.2.1 it works, but only for the CE version, EE is still not recognized
