09:18 < dave_k:#liferay> Is there any checklist on what I have to do to let my Custom Entities show up in the Asset Publisher as custom Asset?
09:19 < dave_k:#liferay> My assets are showing up in DB table ASSETENTRY, but I simply cannot select them in Asset Publisher... there's no Asset Type showing up for them.
11:13 < abeym:#liferay> Hello.
11:14 < abeym:#liferay> Looking for some tips of liferay dev certification
11:17 < jardineworks:#liferay> abeym, I haven't done it myself -- though I am getting ready to. I am told it is quite difficult.
11:19 < abeym:#liferay> Yes Ive heard its tough. Is there some sample questions to test before the actual test?
11:23 < jardineworks:#liferay> abeym, the only ones I have ever found were the handful on the wbsite
11:23 < jardineworks:#liferay> really, you just have to know your stuff :)

14:39 < bfrank:#liferay> hi
14:39 < bfrank:#liferay> I am trying to startup liferay, and it is giving me this error: 16:48:29,413 ERROR [Cache:168] Unable to set localhost. This prevents creation of a GUID. Cause was: <my hostname>, what is causing that?
16:40 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey jhf you around?
16:40 <@jhf:#liferay> yup
16:40 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, quick one for you.. intellij related :). Is there an easy way to get all the DTDs for Liferay to be recognized in a project?
16:40 < jardineworks:#liferay> and all future projects?
