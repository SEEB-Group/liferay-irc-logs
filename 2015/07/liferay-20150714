09:18 < dave_k:#liferay> Is there any checklist on what I have to do to let my Custom Entities show up in the Asset Publisher as custom Asset?
09:19 < dave_k:#liferay> My assets are showing up in DB table ASSETENTRY, but I simply cannot select them in Asset Publisher... there's no Asset Type showing up for them.
11:13 < abeym:#liferay> Hello.
11:14 < abeym:#liferay> Looking for some tips of liferay dev certification
11:17 < jardineworks:#liferay> abeym, I haven't done it myself -- though I am getting ready to. I am told it is quite difficult.
11:19 < abeym:#liferay> Yes Ive heard its tough. Is there some sample questions to test before the actual test?
11:23 < jardineworks:#liferay> abeym, the only ones I have ever found were the handful on the wbsite
11:23 < jardineworks:#liferay> really, you just have to know your stuff :)

14:39 < bfrank:#liferay> hi
14:39 < bfrank:#liferay> I am trying to startup liferay, and it is giving me this error: 16:48:29,413 ERROR [Cache:168] Unable to set localhost. This prevents creation of a GUID. Cause was: <my hostname>, what is causing that?
16:40 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey jhf you around?
16:40 <@jhf:#liferay> yup
16:40 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, quick one for you.. intellij related :). Is there an easy way to get all the DTDs for Liferay to be recognized in a project?
16:40 < jardineworks:#liferay> and all future projects?
16:41 <@jhf:#liferay> yep
16:42 <@jhf:#liferay> one sec will make a video for you
16:43 <@jhf:#liferay> et vous prete
16:43 <@jhf:#liferay> err
16:44 <@jhf:#liferay> etes-vous pret
16:44 < jardineworks:#liferay> haha oui

16:45 <@jhf:#liferay> thoughts?
16:45 < jardineworks:#liferay> checking...
16:45 <@jhf:#liferay> you put the caret on the RED dtd and click the helper thingy and say "fetch external resource"
16:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> lol
16:46 <@jhf:#liferay> from then on any DTD using that URI will be recognized
16:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> now I feel stupid
16:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> thanks jhf :)
16:46 <@jhf:#liferay> the other way is Preferences->DTDs and register it
16:46 <@jhf:#liferay> NOW there is one caveat
16:46 <@jhf:#liferay> when people author DTDs, they can use any URI (sort of like a namespace)
16:47 <@jhf:#liferay> Liferay and many others happen to use URIs that point to actual web resources (downloadable files)
16:47 <@jhf:#liferay> but one could put any URI even ones with invalid schemes, fake hostnames, etc
16:47 < jardineworks:#liferay> i see
16:47 < jardineworks:#liferay> makes sense
16:47 <@jhf:#liferay> in that case you have to download the DTD from *somewhere* and manually register it in intellij
16:47 < jardineworks:#liferay> do you use jrebel?
16:47 <@jhf:#liferay> but I always do the fetch external thing first
16:47 <@jhf:#liferay> I have in the past, but I'm not a serious enough developer to warrant the cost
16:48 < jardineworks:#liferay> I have it -- but I don't think intellij is doing incremental compiles on save.
16:48 < jardineworks:#liferay> I checked the little box and everything... but I don't think it's happening.
16:51 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah.......... well.. try to reinstall windows
16:51 <@jhf:#liferay> ?
16:53 < jardineworks:#liferay> lol
