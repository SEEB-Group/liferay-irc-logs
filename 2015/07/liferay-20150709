11:12 < dave_k:#liferay> Hey all ... I keep getting Unique Constraint Violations on IX_38F0315 (DLFILERANK(COMPANYID,USERID,FILEENTRYID)), coming up on multiple Document/Media requests. Boss said I should drop the index, but I see some speed issues in dropping it... is there a better option to fix the tables?
