02:48 < miha_:#liferay> Hi there!
02:49 < miha_:#liferay> I'm wondering if someone could help me with a hint (or two): I'm trying to build a spring portlet with ant, and I don't know how to specify the spring framework dependency.
02:49 < miha_:#liferay> I'm guessing it has to be specified in the ivy.xml?
03:09 < miha_:#liferay> So, I've added the following to the ivy.xml and this seems to work, although I'm not sure whether this is the correct way to do it?
03:09 < miha_:#liferay> <dependency org="org.springframework" name="spring-webmvc-portlet" rev="3.2.10.RELEASE" force="true" conf="default"/>
