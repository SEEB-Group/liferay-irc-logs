11:16 < jardineworks:#liferay> has anyone in here used the CDN features that come with Liferay?
15:45 < slide:#liferay> I have a question about portlet instances. So I have a portlet on a certain page, is there 1 instance of the portlet created for that page and ALL users? Or does each user get their own instance?
