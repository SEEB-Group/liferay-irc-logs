09:08 < modd_:#liferay> it's easy to get the namespace/portletid by using the portlet request/response but how to get it if you are within a servletfilter?

09:28 < modd_:#liferay> hey jhf. any idea how to get the portlet id/namespace within a servlet filter? my servlet filter is part of a portlet project and I don't want to hardcode the string
09:30 <@jhf:#liferay> don't know for sure, but isn't there some methods in PortalUtil you could call? did you look through existing servlet filters in Liferay to see if there's an example you could copy/paste?
09:32 < modd_:#liferay> I don't see anything usable in PortalUtil
09:35 < modd_:#liferay> maybe this portletapp-thingy in https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/blob/master/portal-impl/src/com/liferay/portal/servlet/filters/language/LanguageFilter.java ...hmm
