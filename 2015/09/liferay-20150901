00:01 < Rumit:#liferay> Hi All, I have a liferay instance setup and running with content created and user, role etc.. configuration done. Now I want to create another instance which is replica of the previous instance. Is there some way in liferay to do this?

20:18 < Cay:#liferay> Hey all, on a custom web archetype, is it possible to access service builder elements? It doesnt have the spring context and I am not sure if I want to do it by hand.
