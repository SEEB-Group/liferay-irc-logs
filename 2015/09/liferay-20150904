09:54 < haba713:#liferay> hi! i've deployed several times plugin packages with jsonws but now i have one package that does not appear on the page /api/jsonws after deployed.
09:55 < haba713:#liferay> what are the most common reasons for this?
09:57 < haba713:#liferay> the same package has portlet and it is deployed ok
13:47 < g00se:#liferay> I'm trying to change ./tomcat-7.0.42/webapps/ROOT/html/portlet/shopping/cart.jsp and have deleted the class file and even an intermediate java file. This is producing no effect. If there some cached copy being used or am i doing something dumb?
