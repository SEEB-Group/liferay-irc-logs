03:15 < twen:#liferay> morning !
03:15 < twen:#liferay> I notice Velocitry and freemarker are 2 scripting language, but I can't see any reference beside the Admin panel. Is Freemarker being left out, or the fiture of Liferay ?
03:23 < plekplek:#liferay> hey twen
03:24 < plekplek:#liferay> somebody correct me if iâ€™m wrong, there has been a move towards freemarker
03:26 < plekplek:#liferay> but vm is still being used and is not likely to be going away. use the one you are most comfortable with :)
03:59 < twen:#liferay> plekplek Thanks for the information :)
04:00 < twen:#liferay> I guess vm eill not go away soomn, there are too many plugin using it. However of freemarker become the default, I guess we might think of a 5 year migration period or so.
