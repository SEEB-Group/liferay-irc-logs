13:25 < daqSam:#liferay> hey all, do you know whether it is possible to get the (original) project name from a portlet JSP? tks
13:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> daqSam, try this -- ServletContext servletContext = request.getSession().getServletContext();
13:51 < daqSam:#liferay> Hi jardineworks, the servletContext works for what I need thanks very much.
13:52 < daqSam:#liferay> I have tried that on a JSP hook now, but that returns an empty string ( servletContext.getContextPath() ). Any thoughts?
14:09 < daqSam:#liferay> not sure if that is possible due to the hook jsp being on the portal class-loader scope. Ultimately I wanted to be able to tell what project/package a JSP was originally from. Anyone? tks
14:32 < jardineworks:#liferay> " I wanted to be able to tell what project/package a JSP was originally from. Anyone? tks" -- are you the guy in the forums who is trying to figure out how to determine what hooks are deployed? :)
14:32 < jardineworks:#liferay> daqSam, ^^
