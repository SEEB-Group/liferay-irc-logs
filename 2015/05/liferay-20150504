05:47 < Andrea___:#liferay> Hi all, i have to do a employee presence surveyor portlet but I don't know where to start from, any suggestion/ tutorial/guide? thanks
06:47 < modd__:#liferay> unless you don't activate monitoring (which costs you lots of performance), you don't know who's actually still logged in
06:52 < Andrea___:#liferay> how do i activate monitoring
08:31 < Stormtrooper:#liferay> In portal.ext.properties...
08:31 < Stormtrooper:#liferay> If u mean user monitoring
08:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> Andrea___, there are a few settings -- as Stormtrooper says, you need to look into the portal.properties and provide the overrides in your portal-ext. First you need to make sure that your auditing filtre is enabled --
08:46 < jardineworks:#liferay>     #
08:46 < jardineworks:#liferay>     # The audit filter populates the AuditRequestThreadLocal with the
08:46 < jardineworks:#liferay>     # appropriate request values to generate audit requests.
08:46 < jardineworks:#liferay>     #
08:46 < jardineworks:#liferay>     com.liferay.portal.servlet.filters.audit.AuditFilter=false
08:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> set it to true
08:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> and then depending on what you want to monitor (how granular) you can set other values --
08:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> like --
08:47 < jardineworks:#liferay> ##
08:47 < jardineworks:#liferay> ## Audit Message
08:47 < jardineworks:#liferay> ##
08:47 < jardineworks:#liferay>     audit.message.com.liferay.portal.model.Layout.VIEW=false
08:47 < jardineworks:#liferay> for page level recording. Though as modd said, there are performance tradeoffs so it usually makes more sense to offload something that granular to something like your proxy server.
08:47 < Andrea___:#liferay> I think there was a misunderstanding, i thought modd was suggesting me to activate monitoring in this chat to see the who is really connected xD
08:48 < Andrea___:#liferay> because I did not asked about liferay monitoring! Sorry if you wasted time
08:56 < Stormtrooper:#liferay> xD
08:58 < Stormtrooper:#liferay> It doesn't play who is online.  Because not all see chat and write here
09:13 < Stormtrooper:#liferay> If I do shutdown liferay. How can I start it ?
09:19 < jardineworks:#liferay> Stormtrooper, you mean, you shut it down from the Server Administration section?
09:19 < Stormtrooper:#liferay> Yes
09:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> you need to go to the command line
09:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> its a silly feature to be honest. Once liferay is shutdown, the control panel is of course no longer available .... so there is no way to start it back up.
09:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> I've always wondered what the point of that feature was.
09:21 < Stormtrooper:#liferay> After shutdown I do shutdown of tomcat too...
09:21 < Stormtrooper:#liferay> And start tomcat again
09:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> pretty sure shut down from the control panel does a tomcat shutdown no?
09:22 < Stormtrooper:#liferay> Tomcat stay alive after lr shutdown
09:23 < jardineworks:#liferay> Stormtrooper, I've never actually used that button... one sec, let me try it on my side.
09:30 < jardineworks:#liferay> Stormtrooper, oh no. so much worse
09:30 < jardineworks:#liferay> this is maintenance mode
09:31 < jardineworks:#liferay> so you need to toggle the "active" status for the Group in the database.
