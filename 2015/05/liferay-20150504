05:47 < Andrea___:#liferay> Hi all, i have to do a employee presence surveyor portlet but I don't know where to start from, any suggestion/ tutorial/guide? thanks
06:47 < modd__:#liferay> unless you don't activate monitoring (which costs you lots of performance), you don't know who's actually still logged in
06:52 < Andrea___:#liferay> how do i activate monitoring
08:31 < Stormtrooper:#liferay> In portal.ext.properties...
08:31 < Stormtrooper:#liferay> If u mean user monitoring
08:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> Andrea___, there are a few settings -- as Stormtrooper says, you need to look into the portal.properties and provide the overrides in your portal-ext. First you need to make sure that your auditing filtre is enabled --
08:46 < jardineworks:#liferay>     #
08:46 < jardineworks:#liferay>     # The audit filter populates the AuditRequestThreadLocal with the
08:46 < jardineworks:#liferay>     # appropriate request values to generate audit requests.
08:46 < jardineworks:#liferay>     #
08:46 < jardineworks:#liferay>     com.liferay.portal.servlet.filters.audit.AuditFilter=false
08:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> set it to true
08:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> and then depending on what you want to monitor (how granular) you can set other values --
08:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> like --
08:47 < jardineworks:#liferay> ##
08:47 < jardineworks:#liferay> ## Audit Message
08:47 < jardineworks:#liferay> ##
08:47 < jardineworks:#liferay>     audit.message.com.liferay.portal.model.Layout.VIEW=false
08:47 < jardineworks:#liferay> for page level recording. Though as modd said, there are performance tradeoffs so it usually makes more sense to offload something that granular to something like your proxy server.
08:47 < Andrea___:#liferay> I think there was a misunderstanding, i thought modd was suggesting me to activate monitoring in this chat to see the who is really connected xD
08:48 < Andrea___:#liferay> because I did not asked about liferay monitoring! Sorry if you wasted time
08:56 < Stormtrooper:#liferay> xD
