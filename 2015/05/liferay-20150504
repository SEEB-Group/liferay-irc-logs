03:45 < twen:#liferay> o/
05:47 < Andrea___:#liferay> Hi all, i have to do a employee presence surveyor portlet but I don't know where to start from, any suggestion/ tutorial/guide? thanks
06:47 < modd__:#liferay> unless you don't activate monitoring (which costs you lots of performance), you don't know who's actually still logged in
06:52 < Andrea___:#liferay> how do i activate monitoring
08:31 < Stormtrooper:#liferay> In portal.ext.properties...
08:31 < Stormtrooper:#liferay> If u mean user monitoring
08:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> Andrea___, there are a few settings -- as Stormtrooper says, you need to look into the portal.properties and provide the overrides in your portal-ext. First you need to make sure that your auditing filtre is enabled --
08:46 < jardineworks:#liferay>     #
08:46 < jardineworks:#liferay>     # The audit filter populates the AuditRequestThreadLocal with the
08:46 < jardineworks:#liferay>     # appropriate request values to generate audit requests.
08:46 < jardineworks:#liferay>     #
08:46 < jardineworks:#liferay>     com.liferay.portal.servlet.filters.audit.AuditFilter=false
08:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> set it to true
08:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> and then depending on what you want to monitor (how granular) you can set other values --
08:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> like --
08:47 < jardineworks:#liferay> ##
08:47 < jardineworks:#liferay> ## Audit Message
08:47 < jardineworks:#liferay> ##
08:47 < jardineworks:#liferay>     audit.message.com.liferay.portal.model.Layout.VIEW=false
08:47 < jardineworks:#liferay> for page level recording. Though as modd said, there are performance tradeoffs so it usually makes more sense to offload something that granular to something like your proxy server.
08:47 < Andrea___:#liferay> I think there was a misunderstanding, i thought modd was suggesting me to activate monitoring in this chat to see the who is really connected xD
08:48 < Andrea___:#liferay> because I did not asked about liferay monitoring! Sorry if you wasted time
08:56 < Stormtrooper:#liferay> xD
08:58 < Stormtrooper:#liferay> It doesn't play who is online.  Because not all see chat and write here
09:13 < Stormtrooper:#liferay> If I do shutdown liferay. How can I start it ?
09:19 < jardineworks:#liferay> Stormtrooper, you mean, you shut it down from the Server Administration section?
09:19 < Stormtrooper:#liferay> Yes
09:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> you need to go to the command line
09:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> its a silly feature to be honest. Once liferay is shutdown, the control panel is of course no longer available .... so there is no way to start it back up.
09:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> I've always wondered what the point of that feature was.
09:21 < Stormtrooper:#liferay> After shutdown I do shutdown of tomcat too...
09:21 < Stormtrooper:#liferay> And start tomcat again
09:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> pretty sure shut down from the control panel does a tomcat shutdown no?
09:22 < Stormtrooper:#liferay> Tomcat stay alive after lr shutdown
09:23 < jardineworks:#liferay> Stormtrooper, I've never actually used that button... one sec, let me try it on my side.
09:30 < jardineworks:#liferay> Stormtrooper, oh no. so much worse
09:30 < jardineworks:#liferay> this is maintenance mode
09:31 < jardineworks:#liferay> so you need to toggle the "active" status for the Group in the database.
09:31 < jardineworks:#liferay> its terrible,.
09:32 < Stormtrooper:#liferay> Oki. Good to know
09:33 < jardineworks:#liferay> Stormtrooper, the best option, honesly for this kind of thing is to use a proxy to enable a maintenance mode.
09:33 < Stormtrooper:#liferay> How help proxy in this case?
09:35 < jardineworks:#liferay> Stormtrooper, well, you block the traffic to the Liferay server and redirect the user to a "maintenance page"
09:35 < jardineworks:#liferay> then whne you are done your maintenance, you remove the redirect.
09:35 < Stormtrooper:#liferay> Ah...
09:35 < Stormtrooper:#liferay> Oki. Thanks
09:35 < jardineworks:#liferay> you can do this dynamically doing something simple like checking for the presence of a file.
09:35 < Dinoop:#liferay> How can I use liferay's user authentication from my mob app?. I want to call Liferay with user credencials and if that user presnt need to get success response
09:36 < jardineworks:#liferay> so you touch <filename> .. which then causes the proxy to start redirecting... and then you rm <filename> when you are done.
09:36 < jardineworks:#liferay> Stormtrooper, weird .. all o fmy sites are still active. Ah! it must be my "company" that is inactive.
09:37 < jardineworks:#liferay> :S company is active too
09:37 < Stormtrooper:#liferay> :) ty for info
09:39 < jardineworks:#liferay> I wonder how the heck I get this out of maintenanc mode now lol
09:41 < jardineworks:#liferay> Stormtrooper, --
09:41 < jardineworks:#liferay> "If you ever need to shut down your Liferay Portal server while users are logged in, you can use the Shutdown tab to inform your logged-in users of the impending shutdown. You can define the number of minutes until the shutdown and a custom message that will be displayed.
09:41 < jardineworks:#liferay> Users will see your message at the top of their portal pages for the duration of time you specified. When the time expires, all portal pages will display a message saying the portal has been shut down. At this point, the server will need to be restarted to restore access. Next, letâ€™s examine how to manage multiple portal instances."
09:44 < Dinoop:#liferay>  How can I use liferay's user authentication from an external application?
09:46 < Stormtrooper:#liferay> Idk
09:46 < Stormtrooper:#liferay> What do u will? Dino?
09:59 < Dinoop:#liferay> Stormtrooper: I am having a mobile application with login screen
10:00 < Dinoop:#liferay> Stormtrooper:When user enters his credencilas and press submit, Ineed to call Liferay to validate user and pass
10:00 < Dinoop:#liferay> Stormtrooper::is this possible?
10:00 < Dinoop:#liferay> Stormtrooper: I want to use liferay just for user authetication
10:02 < Stormtrooper:#liferay> Dinoop this I don't know, sorry
10:03 < Dinoop:#liferay> Stormtrooper: Thanks for the reposne
10:03 < Dinoop:#liferay> Stormtrooper:response*
10:03 < Dinoop:#liferay> Stormtrooper: do u know any one who can help regarding this?
10:04 < Stormtrooper:#liferay> Em.. no :-(
10:07 < twen:#liferay> hello
10:07 < Stormtrooper:#liferay> Hello of twen
10:08 < twen:#liferay> I have Liferay 6.2, and uploads JPG file on a Document & Media. I notice Liferay is missing a lot of metadata when extrating them from the file.
10:08 < twen:#liferay> Is there any plugin to extract more standard metadata (ie tika is extracting all of them)
10:08 < Stormtrooper:#liferay> I think have now same problem
10:16 < jardineworks:#liferay> Dinoop,
10:16 < jardineworks:#liferay> it is possible... but, question, do you just need to authenticate against liferay?
10:16 < jardineworks:#liferay> or are you using Liferay to deliver your mobile application as well?
10:17 < Dinoop:#liferay> jardineworks:I just want to authenticate
10:17 < twen:#liferay> This reminds me of a Single Sign On process
10:17 -!- mode/#liferay [+o jhf] by ChanServ
10:18 < jardineworks:#liferay> Dinoop, ok -- so there are probably a few options for that. You are basically wanting to hit the /login/login url to trigger the login action
10:19 < jardineworks:#liferay> but make sure you pass the credentials.
10:19 < jardineworks:#liferay> once sec, I can give you a curl example.
10:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> Dinoop, for exmaple -- I use a shell script to do cluster deployments and porperties reloading. For me I have to do two steps --
10:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> this call --
10:20 < jardineworks:#liferay>     curl "http://${node}:8080/" -H "'Origin: http://'${node}" --compressed  --insecure -c cookie.txt
10:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> to get the initial cookie
10:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> and then this call --
10:20 < jardineworks:#liferay>     curl "http://${node}:8080/web/guest/welcome?p_p_id=58&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=maximized&p_p_mode=view&_58_struts_action=%2Flogin%2Flogin" -H "'Origin: http://${node}'" --data "'_58_formDate=${current_time}&_58_saveLastPath=false&_58_redirect=%2Fgroup%2Fcontrol_panel&_58_doActionAfterLogin=false&_58_login=${LIFERAY_USER}&_58_password=${LIFERAY_PASSWORD}&_58_rememberMe=false'" --compressed  --insecure -c cookie.txt -b cookie.txt
10:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> to do the actual authentication
10:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> but I am sure there is a way to do it without my first step
10:21 < twen:#liferay> Wow, that's nice URLs :)
10:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, might know :)
10:22 < jardineworks:#liferay> I mean I am sure anyone using the JSON API does their auth using the basic http headers on the first call, not with a double,
10:22 < jardineworks:#liferay> I haven't used that stuff yet though
10:24 < Dinoop:#liferay> jardineworks: ok , p_p_id=58 , can i hadcode this?
10:24 < jardineworks:#liferay> 58 is just the login portlet
10:25 < Dinoop:#liferay>  jardineworks: can I hardcode this?
10:25 < jardineworks:#liferay> so I would assume so
10:25 < jardineworks:#liferay> but I don't think if you have your http request property that you need to... lemme check something
10:29 < Dinoop:#liferay> jardineworks:ok
10:31 < jardineworks:#liferay> Dinoop, this is an interesting thread, but it is referenceing the tunnel-web plugin which is not part of the default install anymore (because I don't think you are supposed to need it necesarily) ... but they are using auth creds in the url.
10:31 < jardineworks:#liferay> https://www.liferay.com/community/forums/-/message_boards/message/938984
10:31 < jardineworks:#liferay> scroll to the bottom and check out Tomas' reply
10:31 < jardineworks:#liferay> he is the security guy I always try to find on here (topolik)
10:36 < Dinoop:#liferay> jardineworks: in the first method u suggested, if I get 200 ok can I take it as success?
10:39 < jardineworks:#liferay> the first method being the curl?
10:39 < jardineworks:#liferay> Dinoop, ^^
10:39 < Dinoop:#liferay> jardineworks: yes
10:40 < jardineworks:#liferay> Dinoop, check out the cookie. if it worked then you will have an attribute ID with a value
10:41 < jardineworks:#liferay> a failed login can still generate a 200 OK .. it'd be a valid response with an error message on the page :)
10:43 < jardineworks:#liferay> Dinoop, if you look at that thread in the message -- Tomas says "For version >= 6.2 you need to explicitly configure the authentication method you prefer. Into portal-ext.properties add:
10:43 < jardineworks:#liferay> 1jsonws.servlet.basic_auth=true"
10:44 < Dinoop:#liferay> jardineworks: is it something like , I have to create one josn webservice with no action but with enabling webservice?
10:45 < Dinoop:#liferay> jardineworks:sorry by enabling authentication
10:47 < Dinoop:#liferay> jardineworks: json*
10:49 < jardineworks:#liferay> Dinoop, oh I see
10:49 < jardineworks:#liferay> sorry... I keep thinking that you actually want to do soemthing in liferay other than just authenticate the user :)
10:51 < Dinoop:#liferay> jardineworks: my use case is I am having a web and mobile app. I dont want to configure users again for mobile app. I want to resuse the users which are already configured in liferay.
10:52 < Dinoop:#liferay> jardineworks: so if some one login using user and pass through mob app I want to call liferay for uthenticating him
10:53 < Dinoop:#liferay> jardineworks: if success he will get all functionality of mob app. No more liferay calls
10:57 < jardineworks:#liferay> Dinoop, understood. Ok, well, there must be a way to do it passing the right parameters .. but alternatively you could create a StrutsAction hook
10:57 < jardineworks:#liferay> and then with that hook, use the username/password passed in the POST in combination with the UserLocalServiceUtil to determine if the login is valid.
11:00 < Dinoop:#liferay> jardineworks: Thank you very much for the response . I wil have try. Also they way which I mentioned , by using jsonwebservice with credencil will work?
11:00 < Dinoop:#liferay> jardineworks: the way*
11:00 < Dinoop:#liferay> jardineworks:credentials*
11:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> Dinoop, you could, but that would mean you have to write a service just for the sake of having a means to authenticate -- which seems kind of gross.
11:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> Dinoop, I know also that there is a way to configure Liferay to be an OAuth provider in 6.2 --- but I have never tried it
11:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> oh
11:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> that might be an EE plugin
11:02 < jardineworks:#liferay> Dinoop, for example -- https://www.liferay.com/web/igor.beslic/blog/-/blogs/what-about-oauth-
11:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> Dinoop, That seems more like what you are after... you want to treat Liferay as an identity provider of sorts.
11:08 < Dinoop:#liferay> jardineworks: Thanks for  your time , I will have a try of the second method using UserLocalServiceUtil first. Expecting further assistance from you. Thanks
11:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> np
11:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> Dinoop, I can send you a tutorial on how to do it
11:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> the hook portion if you like
11:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> its actually for a maintenance check endpoint, but you can alter the execution logic to use a user lookup pretty easily.
11:10 < Dinoop:#liferay> jardineworks: yes please to dinoop.p1@gmail.com
11:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> Dinoop, sent.
11:13 < CyberKatze:#liferay> hey,... is it posssible to get JS_path from WebContent-template?    $js_folder dont exist (
11:14 < Dinoop:#liferay> jardineworks: Thanks
11:16 < Dinoop:#liferay>  jardineworks: I got it
11:16 < Dinoop:#liferay>  jardineworks: bye for today. see you
11:17 < jardineworks:#liferay> have a good night
11:17 < Dinoop:#liferay> jardineworks: good night
11:18 < CyberKatze:#liferay> arrr..... hate staging...
11:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> CyberKatze, you are not a lone in that camp. There are many people who share your discontent :)
11:23 < CyberKatze:#liferay> :)
11:24 < CyberKatze:#liferay> this staging, kill my brain.... on old server work fine... now no...
11:24 < CyberKatze:#liferay> same templates , same structures...
11:24 < CyberKatze:#liferay> but nothing work...
11:29 < jardineworks:#liferay> CyberKatze, pfft.. I have a public pages lar file. First three times I imported it.. always with the same settings, failed. Fourth time? works.
11:29 < jardineworks:#liferay> I call it the "Disney Effect"
11:29 < jardineworks:#liferay> sometimes you just have to believe, and magic will happen :)
11:31 < CyberKatze:#liferay> xD
11:48 < Andrea___:#liferay> Jardine are you there?
11:48 < jardineworks:#liferay> sort of
11:51 < Andrea___:#liferay> May i bother you with another noob question?
11:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> ask away.. I'm pretty buy right now but I will answer when I have time,
11:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> if not me, maybe soemone else
11:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> :)
11:52 < Andrea___:#liferay> I need to develop an employee presence surveyor portlet but i don't know where to start, can you give me a good point to start?
11:52 < Andrea___:#liferay> tutorial/guide/ whatever
11:53 < jardineworks:#liferay> I think we have a language barrier. What this -- employee presence surveyor portlet :)
11:55 < Andrea___:#liferay> every employee that works in the field of it consulting has to compile, at the end of the month , a form where he/she writes how much/for who/for what project has worked
11:55 < CyberKatze:#liferay> aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
11:55 < CyberKatze:#liferay> HEEELP
11:55 < Andrea___:#liferay> Is it a little more clear? if no i'' try to explain better
11:56 < CyberKatze:#liferay> $entry.getAssetsRenderer().getURLViewInContext()  doesn't work for guest user... for all other work perfect.. WHY?   LR62GA4,, on GA3 work perfect...
11:58 < jardineworks:#liferay> Andrea___, so it's like an audit log of the work they have done for the month
11:58 < jardineworks:#liferay> Andrea___, who they worked for, what project, how long, etc.
12:03 < CyberKatze:#liferay> can any1 help me , please?
12:04 < Andrea___:#liferay> yes exactly
12:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> Andrea___, ok
12:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> gimme a minute
12:06 < jardineworks:#liferay> Andrea___, I would start with something unrelated so that you understand the concepts first.
12:06 < jardineworks:#liferay> Andrea___, do you know how to make a basic MVC Portlet?
12:06 < jardineworks:#liferay> (Liferay MVC that is)
12:07 < Andrea___:#liferay> more or less..
12:07 < jardineworks:#liferay> ok -- so start by making a sample plugin.
12:07 < jardineworks:#liferay> then give me your email address and I'll send you a tutorial for the next step --
12:09 < Andrea___:#liferay> did you get it?
12:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> sent
12:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> There are a million service builder tutorials
12:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> but the ones I sent you are pretty detailed and step by step
12:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> explaining everything along the way
12:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> Service Builder is the Liferay way to build data driven applications (like you are trying to do).
12:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> so start with that, come back with your questions... and when you have your SB stuff working let us know and I'll put you onto the next step ;)
12:13 < Andrea___:#liferay> okey, thanks a lot
12:32 < bijoo_:#liferay> CyberKatze: I'm not sure why, though have you checked AP? Asset Publisher has option like that; and it works for a Guest user as well; would need more information from your end.
12:32 < bijoo_:#liferay> CyberKatze: for example, what is your page setup; what are the permissions and what's error
12:42 < CyberKatze:#liferay> i'm here
12:44 < bijoo_:#liferay> CyberKatze: okay; have you checked Asset Publisher?
12:44 < CyberKatze:#liferay> dont work.. with "view in context" too
12:44 < CyberKatze:#liferay> yes, i cheched
12:45 < bijoo_:#liferay> CyberKatze: okay; I'll look into it, I see this:
12:45 < bijoo_:#liferay> http://www.liferay.com/community/forums/-/message_boards/message/53154387
12:45 < CyberKatze:#liferay> if something wrong with settings -> i must don't work for admin user too.. but work..
12:45 < bijoo_:#liferay> CyberKatze: so seems you've had issue for a while now
12:45 < bijoo_:#liferay> CyberKatze: I'll look into it later on today; and respond to you both here, forum
12:45 < CyberKatze:#liferay> yes... this is my post..
12:45 < CyberKatze:#liferay> ty very much...
12:45 < CyberKatze:#liferay> on GA3 work good...
12:46 < CyberKatze:#liferay> i installed new GA4 + new DB...
12:46 < CyberKatze:#liferay> same template and same settings..
12:47 < bijoo_:#liferay> CyberKatze: I'll try on GA4 with a new site; and let you know of my result and cause
12:48 < CyberKatze:#liferay> do u need templates?
12:48 < CyberKatze:#liferay> can put on forum
12:54 < bijoo_:#liferay> CyberKatze: I see the test you put on the forum
12:54 < bijoo_:#liferay> CyberKatze: I'll check with that template when I do it
13:01 < bijoo_:#liferay> CyberKatze: I just tried it with AP and it works. I didn't turn on Staging on it though.
13:01 < bijoo_:#liferay> Two questions come to mind for this: guest have context layout view permission?
13:01 < bijoo_:#liferay> Other Does article have guest view permission?
13:01 < CyberKatze:#liferay> y
13:02 < CyberKatze:#liferay> guet have permission of "add discussion" and "view"
13:02 < CyberKatze:#liferay> guest*
13:03 < CyberKatze:#liferay> ON GA2 i had this issues with View-permission.. now i chacked always this option.
13:03 < bijoo_:#liferay> CyberKatze: so are you able to get it to work? E.g. here is what I tried here: go to user's profile page and add Blog; add Asset Publisher and view as Guest; Guest is able to view blog in context
13:03 < CyberKatze:#liferay> i updated my forum
13:03 < bijoo_:#liferay> CyberKatze: try the test steps I gave and see if works
13:03 < CyberKatze:#liferay> one moment
13:04 < bijoo_:#liferay> CyberKatze: make sure guest can view the structure as well
13:05 < bijoo_:#liferay> CyberKatze: give Guest Structure, Template VIEW permission
13:05 < bijoo_:#liferay> CyberKatze: I'm almost certain permission issue
13:05 < bijoo_:#liferay> CyberKatze: that's why it works for the admin as well
13:05 < bijoo_:#liferay> CyberKatze: make sure all assets involved allow Guest
13:06 < CyberKatze:#liferay> why this is not automatically?
13:07 < CyberKatze:#liferay> Bijoo on which time are you normally here?
13:08 < bijoo_:#liferay> CyberKatze: since fine-grained permission system
13:08 < bijoo_:#liferay> CyberKatze: on usually work days EST
13:09 < bijoo_:#liferay> real fine ;)
13:09 < bijoo_:#liferay> CyberKatze: did it work or is it still an issue?
13:10 < CyberKatze:#liferay> i check all places with permissions.. one moment
13:11 < CyberKatze:#liferay> i activated staging... need time to publishing
13:11 < CyberKatze:#liferay> nope... same...
13:11 < CyberKatze:#liferay> structure + template have GUEST VIEW permission..
13:12 < CyberKatze:#liferay> should i active PERMISSION checkbox too?
13:12 < CyberKatze:#liferay> activate**
13:12 < bijoo_:#liferay> CyberKatze: no need to have the permission checkbox
13:12 < bijoo_:#liferay> CyberKatze: did you try the basic test case I gave?
13:12 < bijoo_:#liferay> CyberKatze: I will now move on to structure, template
13:12 < CyberKatze:#liferay> i do full restart web-broser, maybe chache
13:14 < CyberKatze:#liferay> "no user exist with primary key 0" + "undeclaredThrowableEception"...
13:14 < bijoo_:#liferay> CyberKatze: very doubtful that that is the issue
13:15 < CyberKatze:#liferay> hm...
13:15 < bijoo_:#liferay> CyberKatze: if you try with no template, does it work?
13:15 < bijoo_:#liferay> For example the use case I described above
13:16 < CyberKatze:#liferay> what do u mean "without template"?
13:17 < CyberKatze:#liferay> as "default"-template?
13:17 < bijoo_:#liferay> CyberKatze: I mean, yes, no structure and no template
13:17 < bijoo_:#liferay> CyberKatze: just a plain old Web Content Article
13:17 < CyberKatze:#liferay> one moemnt
13:19 < CyberKatze:#liferay> with Abstract-Template can see AP-content.
13:19 < CyberKatze:#liferay> with my no..
13:19 < CyberKatze:#liferay> hm..
13:28 < CyberKatze:#liferay> what does it mean "Role-Permission" ?
13:30 < CyberKatze:#liferay> if i publish to Live should i check "Permissions"-checkbox in saging-window?
13:35 < bijoo_:#liferay> CyberKatze: yes, otherwise permissions will not go? Also, try the test case without Stage first.
13:38 < CyberKatze:#liferay> i can't test without staging..
13:38 < CyberKatze:#liferay> with checked Permission-checkbox, same..
13:40 < CyberKatze:#liferay> clear full cache.. nothing in AP..
13:42 < CyberKatze:#liferay> one moment
13:47 < CyberKatze:#liferay> same problem..
