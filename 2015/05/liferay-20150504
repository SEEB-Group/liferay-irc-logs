05:47 < Andrea___:#liferay> Hi all, i have to do a employee presence surveyor portlet but I don't know where to start from, any suggestion/ tutorial/guide? thanks
06:47 < modd__:#liferay> unless you don't activate monitoring (which costs you lots of performance), you don't know who's actually still logged in
06:52 < Andrea___:#liferay> how do i activate monitoring
08:31 < Stormtrooper:#liferay> In portal.ext.properties...
08:31 < Stormtrooper:#liferay> If u mean user monitoring
08:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> Andrea___, there are a few settings -- as Stormtrooper says, you need to look into the portal.properties and provide the overrides in your portal-ext. First you need to make sure that your auditing filtre is enabled --
08:46 < jardineworks:#liferay>     #
08:46 < jardineworks:#liferay>     # The audit filter populates the AuditRequestThreadLocal with the
08:46 < jardineworks:#liferay>     # appropriate request values to generate audit requests.
08:46 < jardineworks:#liferay>     #
08:46 < jardineworks:#liferay>     com.liferay.portal.servlet.filters.audit.AuditFilter=false
08:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> set it to true
08:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> and then depending on what you want to monitor (how granular) you can set other values --
08:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> like --
08:47 < jardineworks:#liferay> ##
08:47 < jardineworks:#liferay> ## Audit Message
08:47 < jardineworks:#liferay> ##
08:47 < jardineworks:#liferay>     audit.message.com.liferay.portal.model.Layout.VIEW=false
08:47 < jardineworks:#liferay> for page level recording. Though as modd said, there are performance tradeoffs so it usually makes more sense to offload something that granular to something like your proxy server.
08:47 < Andrea___:#liferay> I think there was a misunderstanding, i thought modd was suggesting me to activate monitoring in this chat to see the who is really connected xD
08:48 < Andrea___:#liferay> because I did not asked about liferay monitoring! Sorry if you wasted time
08:56 < Stormtrooper:#liferay> xD
08:58 < Stormtrooper:#liferay> It doesn't play who is online.  Because not all see chat and write here
09:13 < Stormtrooper:#liferay> If I do shutdown liferay. How can I start it ?
09:19 < jardineworks:#liferay> Stormtrooper, you mean, you shut it down from the Server Administration section?
09:19 < Stormtrooper:#liferay> Yes
09:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> you need to go to the command line
09:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> its a silly feature to be honest. Once liferay is shutdown, the control panel is of course no longer available .... so there is no way to start it back up.
09:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> I've always wondered what the point of that feature was.
09:21 < Stormtrooper:#liferay> After shutdown I do shutdown of tomcat too...
09:21 < Stormtrooper:#liferay> And start tomcat again
09:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> pretty sure shut down from the control panel does a tomcat shutdown no?
09:22 < Stormtrooper:#liferay> Tomcat stay alive after lr shutdown
09:23 < jardineworks:#liferay> Stormtrooper, I've never actually used that button... one sec, let me try it on my side.
09:30 < jardineworks:#liferay> Stormtrooper, oh no. so much worse
09:30 < jardineworks:#liferay> this is maintenance mode
09:31 < jardineworks:#liferay> so you need to toggle the "active" status for the Group in the database.
09:31 < jardineworks:#liferay> its terrible,.
09:32 < Stormtrooper:#liferay> Oki. Good to know
09:33 < jardineworks:#liferay> Stormtrooper, the best option, honesly for this kind of thing is to use a proxy to enable a maintenance mode.
09:33 < Stormtrooper:#liferay> How help proxy in this case?
09:35 < jardineworks:#liferay> Stormtrooper, well, you block the traffic to the Liferay server and redirect the user to a "maintenance page"
09:35 < jardineworks:#liferay> then whne you are done your maintenance, you remove the redirect.
09:35 < Stormtrooper:#liferay> Ah...
09:35 < Stormtrooper:#liferay> Oki. Thanks
09:35 < jardineworks:#liferay> you can do this dynamically doing something simple like checking for the presence of a file.
09:35 < Dinoop:#liferay> How can I use liferay's user authentication from my mob app?. I want to call Liferay with user credencials and if that user presnt need to get success response
09:36 < jardineworks:#liferay> so you touch <filename> .. which then causes the proxy to start redirecting... and then you rm <filename> when you are done.
09:36 < jardineworks:#liferay> Stormtrooper, weird .. all o fmy sites are still active. Ah! it must be my "company" that is inactive.
09:37 < jardineworks:#liferay> :S company is active too
09:37 < Stormtrooper:#liferay> :) ty for info
09:39 < jardineworks:#liferay> I wonder how the heck I get this out of maintenanc mode now lol
09:41 < jardineworks:#liferay> Stormtrooper, --
09:41 < jardineworks:#liferay> "If you ever need to shut down your Liferay Portal server while users are logged in, you can use the Shutdown tab to inform your logged-in users of the impending shutdown. You can define the number of minutes until the shutdown and a custom message that will be displayed.
09:41 < jardineworks:#liferay> Users will see your message at the top of their portal pages for the duration of time you specified. When the time expires, all portal pages will display a message saying the portal has been shut down. At this point, the server will need to be restarted to restore access. Next, letâ€™s examine how to manage multiple portal instances."
09:44 < Dinoop:#liferay>  How can I use liferay's user authentication from an external application?
09:46 < Stormtrooper:#liferay> Idk
09:46 < Stormtrooper:#liferay> What do u will? Dino?
09:59 < Dinoop:#liferay> Stormtrooper: I am having a mobile application with login screen
10:00 < Dinoop:#liferay> Stormtrooper:When user enters his credencilas and press submit, Ineed to call Liferay to validate user and pass
10:00 < Dinoop:#liferay> Stormtrooper::is this possible?
10:00 < Dinoop:#liferay> Stormtrooper: I want to use liferay just for user authetication
10:02 < Stormtrooper:#liferay> Dinoop this I don't know, sorry
10:03 < Dinoop:#liferay> Stormtrooper: Thanks for the reposne
10:03 < Dinoop:#liferay> Stormtrooper:response*
10:03 < Dinoop:#liferay> Stormtrooper: do u know any one who can help regarding this?
10:04 < Stormtrooper:#liferay> Em.. no :-(
10:07 < twen:#liferay> hello
10:07 < Stormtrooper:#liferay> Hello of twen
10:08 < twen:#liferay> I have Liferay 6.2, and uploads JPG file on a Document & Media. I notice Liferay is missing a lot of metadata when extrating them from the file.
10:08 < twen:#liferay> Is there any plugin to extract more standard metadata (ie tika is extracting all of them)
10:08 < Stormtrooper:#liferay> I think have now same problem
10:16 < jardineworks:#liferay> Dinoop,
10:16 < jardineworks:#liferay> it is possible... but, question, do you just need to authenticate against liferay?
