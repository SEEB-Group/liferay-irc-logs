05:49 < Andrea___:#liferay> okei! I'm building a portal for a company so i need the normal Employee(with User role) to be able to edit ONLY : phone numbers, additional emails , instant messaging and the photo. How can i achieve this?
05:50 < Andrea___:#liferay> every other field must be visible but Disabled
05:51 < Andrea___:#liferay> Well, i forgot that i'm talking about the My Account portlet, in the ACCOUNT SeTTINGs tab
06:00 < Andrea_:#liferay> I dropped, anyone replied to my question?
07:28 < hufg:#liferay> helloo

07:34 < CyberKatze:#liferay> hallo

07:37 < CyberKatze:#liferay> liferay CE 6.2 GA4
07:41 < hufg:#liferay> whaat what
07:41 < hufg:#liferay> what fix
07:41 < hufg:#liferay> are you fixing something
07:41 < hufg:#liferay> use ext-plugin instead
07:41 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> 1 min
07:41 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> LPS-54160
07:43 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> 4lines code... but ) get more problem )
07:44 < hufg:#liferay> uhuh the fix version is ee
07:44 < hufg:#liferay> it may or may not work with ce
07:44 < hufg:#liferay> anyhow
07:44 < hufg:#liferay> use ext-plugin
07:44 < hufg:#liferay> staging+shiet is risky business don't recommend
07:45 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> what is ext-plugin?
07:45 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> and how can it help me?
07:47 < hufg:#liferay> it let's you overwrite any class in liferay
07:47 < ikb:#liferay> a way to alter lifray core
07:48 < hufg:#liferay> so you take your ee patch, pray to god, put the patched class into ext-plugin and deploy it
07:48 < hufg:#liferay> and give another prayer for staging+page versioning
07:48 < ikb:#liferay> pray the god is the important part :)
07:49 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> hehe..
07:49 < hufg:#liferay> yes for productivity praying is important
07:50 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> 1 week ago u had deadline with start site... and migated in GA4 version.. all work without news-page with AssetPublisher-handmade Templates ((
07:51 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> and now we have a pause until fix this function (( aaa
08:13 < Andrea_:#liferay> What is a good alternative to scriptlets to override a jsp with a hook
08:13 < Andrea_:#liferay> ?*
08:14 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> what do u will do?
08:20 < hufg:#liferay> nothing
08:20 < hufg:#liferay> they are full of scriptlets anyhow
08:20 < hufg:#liferay> you'd need some backend to abstract away the functionality
08:21 < hufg:#liferay> and it's useless to remove the scriptlets and use jstl
08:21 < hufg:#liferay> because you won't get it all away anyhow
08:21 < Andrea_:#liferay> My boss says scriptlets are obsolete
08:21 < hufg:#liferay> yes they are but in liferay they aren't
08:21 < hufg:#liferay> you override liferay hook -> live with scriptlets
08:21 < hufg:#liferay> liferay jsp with hook
08:21 < Andrea_:#liferay> but I'm doing a JSP Hook and there are ONLY scriptlets
08:22 < Andrea_:#liferay> ok, this will be my reply to him
08:22 < Andrea_:#liferay> so , to override things with hooks -> scriptlets
08:23 < Andrea_:#liferay> and to create new portlets, what do you suggest?
08:23 < hufg:#liferay> well depends
08:23 < hufg:#liferay> on your project
08:24 < hufg:#liferay> not much time and easy projects --> basic jsp stuff, otherwise perhaps something more current like angular if you have time to learn js etc
08:25 < Andrea_:#liferay> ok, thanks
08:25 < hufg:#liferay> more complex portlets jsf is a valid choice
08:25 < hufg:#liferay> just can't make the ui as cutting edge as with angular
08:26 < hufg:#liferay> my point being with the scriptlets they have functionality that would be moved into the backend and given as request parameters etc. and it's insanity to start doing that for liferay jsp
08:27 < hufg:#liferay> so you live with scriptlets
08:30 < hufg:#liferay> it's beneficial to make the framework choice uniform across the projects, ie. everything with basic jsp, everything with angular and so forth
08:50 < Andrea_:#liferay> thanks hufg, one little more question about technology..Is the way you call object in jsp the same in JSF? for example the current user
08:51 < hufg:#liferay> uhuh it's basicly the same but you don't have any automatic binding
08:51 < hufg:#liferay> and you have to manually add everything to request parameters
08:51 < Andrea_:#liferay> for example in a hook i did i wrote a scriptlet with User currentUser = PortalUtil.getUser(request);
08:52 < hufg:#liferay> to access currentUser in jsp you something like request.addParameter("param", userObject)
