05:49 < Andrea___:#liferay> okei! I'm building a portal for a company so i need the normal Employee(with User role) to be able to edit ONLY : phone numbers, additional emails , instant messaging and the photo. How can i achieve this?
05:50 < Andrea___:#liferay> every other field must be visible but Disabled
05:51 < Andrea___:#liferay> Well, i forgot that i'm talking about the My Account portlet, in the ACCOUNT SeTTINGs tab
06:00 < Andrea_:#liferay> I dropped, anyone replied to my question?

07:41 < hufg:#liferay> whaat what
07:41 < hufg:#liferay> what fix
07:41 < hufg:#liferay> are you fixing something
07:41 < hufg:#liferay> use ext-plugin instead
07:41 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> 1 min
07:41 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> LPS-54160
07:43 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> 4lines code... but ) get more problem )
07:44 < hufg:#liferay> uhuh the fix version is ee
07:44 < hufg:#liferay> it may or may not work with ce
07:44 < hufg:#liferay> anyhow
07:44 < hufg:#liferay> use ext-plugin
07:44 < hufg:#liferay> staging+shiet is risky business don't recommend
07:45 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> what is ext-plugin?
07:45 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> and how can it help me?
07:47 < hufg:#liferay> it let's you overwrite any class in liferay
07:47 < ikb:#liferay> a way to alter lifray core
07:48 < hufg:#liferay> so you take your ee patch, pray to god, put the patched class into ext-plugin and deploy it
07:48 < hufg:#liferay> and give another prayer for staging+page versioning
07:48 < ikb:#liferay> pray the god is the important part :)
07:49 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> hehe..
07:49 < hufg:#liferay> yes for productivity praying is important
07:50 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> 1 week ago u had deadline with start site... and migated in GA4 version.. all work without news-page with AssetPublisher-handmade Templates ((
07:51 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> and now we have a pause until fix this function (( aaa
08:13 < Andrea_:#liferay> What is a good alternative to scriptlets to override a jsp with a hook
08:13 < Andrea_:#liferay> ?*
08:14 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> what do u will do?
08:20 < hufg:#liferay> nothing
08:20 < hufg:#liferay> they are full of scriptlets anyhow
08:20 < hufg:#liferay> you'd need some backend to abstract away the functionality
08:21 < hufg:#liferay> and it's useless to remove the scriptlets and use jstl
