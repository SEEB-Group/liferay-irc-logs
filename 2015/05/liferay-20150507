04:08 < Andrea__:#liferay> Hi all! how ca i hide a private page of a site to all roles except one?
05:43 < ikb_:#liferay> i have some assetentry that point to non existing entities
05:43 < ikb_:#liferay> how can i clean the asseentry table?
06:05 < Axxell:#liferay> hi guys, problem: trying to get groupid and companyid inside scheduler message of my portlet, but cant get themedisplay to get them
06:33 < hufg:#liferay> ikb_: how it's non existing?
06:33 < hufg:#liferay> i guess you can try to map the assetentry classpk and if it's missing from the target table it's a dead entry
06:33 < hufg:#liferay> perhaps
06:33 < hufg:#liferay> depends how it's nonexisting
06:33 < hufg:#liferay> Axxell: i think you can get themedisplay np from portlets
06:34 < hufg:#liferay> oh themedisplay cant get it
06:34 < Axxell:#liferay> yup because there is no request item
06:34 < hufg:#liferay> yep
06:34 < hufg:#liferay> uhh so what groupid and companyid do you wnat?
06:34 < Axxell:#liferay> i need the groupid and companyid for service stuff
06:35 < [Enrico]:#liferay> hi there. I've a page where I cannot give the Guest role permission to view for some reason. Any clue what can it be? Use LR 6.2 GA4
06:35 < hufg:#liferay> just hard code that sucker if you know the groupid and company id already
06:35 < hufg:#liferay> and it wont change
06:35 < hufg:#liferay> make it configurable?
06:35 < Axxell:#liferay> hmm
06:35 < Axxell:#liferay> any more elegant way
06:36 < hufg:#liferay> how is that inelegant? if your scheduler stuff lives outside of the request how are you going to map a groupid when the groupid is the groupid of the current page?
06:36 < Axxell:#liferay> well groupid might change?
06:36 < [Enrico]:#liferay> it's just that one page having the problem, all other pages are fine. Guest can be give the view permission. Unfortunately the problematic page is the home page and since it doesn't work no login is possible
06:37 < hufg:#liferay> Axxell: groupid is the id of the site and some other stuff, it wont change after the site has been done, though there may be "new" groupids as in new sites
06:37 < Axxell:#liferay> true... i wish the scheduler would be more.. per portlet instance
06:38 < hufg:#liferay> [Enrico]: fidget with permissions, restart hehe
06:38 < hufg:#liferay> not sure what companyid is though
