04:08 < Andrea__:#liferay> Hi all! how ca i hide a private page of a site to all roles except one?
05:43 < ikb_:#liferay> i have some assetentry that point to non existing entities
05:43 < ikb_:#liferay> how can i clean the asseentry table?
06:05 < Axxell:#liferay> hi guys, problem: trying to get groupid and companyid inside scheduler message of my portlet, but cant get themedisplay to get them
06:33 < hufg:#liferay> ikb_: how it's non existing?
06:33 < hufg:#liferay> i guess you can try to map the assetentry classpk and if it's missing from the target table it's a dead entry
06:33 < hufg:#liferay> perhaps
06:33 < hufg:#liferay> depends how it's nonexisting
06:33 < hufg:#liferay> Axxell: i think you can get themedisplay np from portlets
06:34 < hufg:#liferay> oh themedisplay cant get it
06:34 < Axxell:#liferay> yup because there is no request item
06:34 < hufg:#liferay> yep
06:34 < hufg:#liferay> uhh so what groupid and companyid do you wnat?
06:34 < Axxell:#liferay> i need the groupid and companyid for service stuff
