08:00 < goku_:#liferay> hi, when am trying to cluster liferay6.2-ga2 (with tomcat7 and mysql5 and solr4) . the users are not showing,there where no exceptions on the logs but users are not showing on both nodes.anybody have any idea about this issue?
08:54 < jardineworks:#liferay> goku_, do yo uhave the property lucene.replicate.write=true in the portal-ext.properties file (on both nodes)?
08:59 < ikb:#liferay> is someone here expert about Soaicl Office?
09:10 < goku_:#liferay> jardineworks: yes i have given that ,but still same issue
09:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> goku_, Are you using the disk for storage? or do you have a search server?
09:13 < goku_:#liferay> jardineworks: am using disk for storage and solr4 for search server
09:14 < jardineworks:#liferay> goku_, "sol4 for search server" -- meaning you have a separate server? or you have solr installed on both node using the data/lucene directory as its root data store?
09:16 < goku_:#liferay> i have made the solr as seperate search server
09:18 < goku_:#liferay> jardineworks: and copied the schema.xml file from the solr-web.war(from market place) and copied to the solr-4.10.4/example/solr/collection1/conf/
09:19 < goku_:#liferay> jardineworks: from the liferay documentation i am a bit confused .like do i have to deploy the solr-web.war from the marketplace to both the nodes ..or coping the schema.xml file will do
09:21 < hufg:#liferay> helloo how are you all today
09:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> goku_, ah I see.. ok, so first let's understand how all this plumbinh works.
09:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> goku_, default setup, a single liferay server writes its search data to disk under LIFERAY_HOME/data/lucene/<company-id>
09:22 < jardineworks:#liferay> goku_, Cluster configuration, same thing, BUT there is a listener that detects a write on one node and then send a message (using jgroups) to the other node(s) to tell them to do that same thing -- so your indices should stay synched.
09:23 < jardineworks:#liferay> goku_, Now you introduce a solr search server. This means that you no longer want to use the disk (data/lucene) stuff... and now, you want all the search stuff to be offloaded to the solr server -- including the indexing operations.
09:23 < jardineworks:#liferay> so you need to make sure that BOTH nodes have the same configuration (including plugins) and that both nodes are able to access your external SOLR server.
09:24 < jardineworks:#liferay> in this case, the property we referenceed above no longer matters because thtere is no "replication" operation that occurs... both nodes are talking to the same server, and hence working with a single index in place of two.
09:36 < hufg:#liferay> whats wrong with 6.2 themes the aui styles are everywhere? :D
10:01 < goku_:#liferay> jardineworks:ok but is there any other config required for this solr server to work properly
10:02 < jardineworks:#liferay> goku_, if you have the sole-web plugin deployed on both nodes, and it is configured correctly, I don't think so. All the requests will be funneled to the one server right?
10:03 < goku_:#liferay> jardineworks:am seeing the logs on the solr while interacting with liferay nodes
10:04 < goku_:#liferay> jardineworks: the portlet i have added to the page is showing on both the nodes
10:06 < goku_:#liferay> jardineworks: and one more error i got when i tried to reindex from the server administration menu,that is a exception saying "NoSuchUser with contact id = 79218" like this
10:07 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> hi all
10:08 < goku_:#liferay> jardineworks : this is the configs i have added to the portal-ext.properties dl.store.impl=com.liferay.portlet.documentlibrary.store.FileSystemStore,dl.store.file.system.root.dir=/base/sdk/liferay_6.2/liferay-portal-6.2.0-ce-ga1-cluster/data/document_library,org.quartz.jobStore.isClustered=true,lucene.replicate.write=true,cluster.link.enabled=true,cluster.link.autodetect.address=localhost:3306,net.sf.ehcache.configurationResourceName=/ehcache/hibernate-clu
10:08 < goku_:#liferay> stered.xml,ehcache.multi.vm.config.location=/ehcache/liferay-multi-vm-clustered.xml
10:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> goku_, those settings are more for the cache clustering (in your setup) than anything. All your search activity is going to a single (external) server so there is no replication. Here is what I would do. Start with Node A (disable the other node and the cluster configuration). Configure it with the solr0web plugin etc... and then add some content, do some searches, make sure it is all working (including using the admin tool on solr).
10:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> If it is, then turn off node A and do the same test with node b
10:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> when both nodes are working independently of a cluster setup, you know that the search configuration is correct.
10:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> then introduce the portal-ext settings.
10:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> if it still doesn't give you what you expect, then chances are you have a cache replication issue, not a search issue.
10:12 < goku_:#liferay> jardineworks: ok i will check that way
10:13 < jardineworks:#liferay> goku_, baby steps.. don't try and eat the whole pizza in one bite. It's so much faster to do these things in bits and pieces
10:15 < goku_:#liferay> jardineworks: but actually liferay pizza is something like added more chilly on it..even single piece counts
10:17 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> can u help me plz. we try to make connection to our server from internet with www.xyz.com and do redirect on our Liferay internal server lrserver.local.com:1111. but we have problem with AUI.css and CUSTOM.css... this 2 files will be not right sent. all other css's and js's files will be rewrited with external URL, but aui+custom with local... is it possible to change this???
10:19 < jardineworks:#liferay> goku_, hahah I suppose. But even with one piece, yo ucan still take one bite at a time instead of shoving the whole thing in your mouth :)
10:21 < goku_:#liferay> jardineworks: hm yea man..
10:41 < hufg:#liferay> srsly are you people serious with the aui styles
10:41 < hufg:#liferay> :D
10:42 < hufg:#liferay> a great plan to "encapsulate" aui styles with .aui and then tag html with the class
10:44 < hufg:#liferay> oh well
10:46 < hufg:#liferay> there must have been tons of bitching about this
10:47 < ikb:#liferay> someone can explain me the proper way to patch/change the social office code and publish to liferay tomcat bundle?
12:20 < g00se:#liferay> "Open GuestbookPortlet.java. Liferay IDE generated this class when you created the portlet" (from the plugin tutorial). It didn't.
13:32 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> need help with this: https://www.liferay.com/de/community/forums/-/message_boards/message/54322397
13:46 < g00se:#liferay> ProxyPassReverseCookieDomain is set?
14:21 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> where?
14:25 < g00se:#liferay> That would be assuming use of Apache
14:34 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> i use tomcat server for liferay preinstalled
14:35 < g00se:#liferay> OK. Then please ignore that
14:36 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> :) np
14:36 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> each week - new problem :)
14:37 < g00se:#liferay> I can't even get _started_ with the plugin tutorial ;)
14:44 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> why?
14:58 < g00se:#liferay> There's a bug mentioned in the forums. Also the components that have to be got are not well specified in the tutorial
14:58 < jardineworks:#liferay> I've got a good one incase anyone is bored: https://www.liferay.com/community/forums/-/message_boards/message/54321952
14:58 < jardineworks:#liferay> g00se, can you share the link for the tutorial?
15:06 < g00se:#liferay> https://dev.liferay.com/develop/learning-paths/-/knowledge_base/6-2/developing-apps-with-liferay-ide
15:07 < g00se:#liferay> In my case (Debian Wheezy x64) any attempts to run anything later than Eclipse Kepler simply crash
15:15 < jardineworks:#liferay> g00se, gonna look at the tutorial now, but have you tried creating the plugin from the command line?
15:17 < jardineworks:#liferay> oh I see.. the turtorial is doing everything in the IDE
15:17 < jardineworks:#liferay> *barf*
15:17 < g00se:#liferay> I didn't actually. Unfortunately i think i bust the setup by deleting the bundle directory by accident, and don't remember where it came from :(
15:18 < jardineworks:#liferay> the bundle directory... ah you can download that on it's own without the IDE
15:18 < jardineworks:#liferay> which version of the portal are you using?
15:20 < g00se:#liferay> This is what it WAS before i deleted it: liferay-portal-6.2-ce-ga4/tomcat-7.0.42
15:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> right -- so you can just download that bundle
15:22 < jardineworks:#liferay> g00se, https://www.liferay.com/downloads/liferay-portal/available-releases
15:22 < g00se:#liferay> Trouble is - i've got exactly the same problem as this guy:
15:23 < g00se:#liferay> https://www.liferay.com/en_GB/community/forums/-/message_boards/view_message/54314677#_19_message_54020506
15:23 < g00se:#liferay> So i really need a whole new set of components to overcome that bug
15:25 < jardineworks:#liferay> g00se, ok -- yeah, I can give you a work around for that piece. You can create the project using the SDK in the terminal and then import it into the IDE.
15:26 < g00se:#liferay> Ah, interesting. You'll see that he imported the result into the IDE but i did that and the .java files simply were not there
15:27 < g00se:#liferay> Do you think your workaround will keep all intended files intact?
15:29 < g00se:#liferay> I say 'files' - it amounts i think to the MVCPortlet
15:30 < jardineworks:#liferay> g00se, right,.. the terminal version doesn't have all the options that the IDE does. You;ll need to make some changes manually once the project is imported, but I can help you with that. And honestly, it's a better approach so that you understand the project structure and some of the plumbing.
15:34 < g00se:#liferay> OK. I'm happy with that. As a Java 'tutor' myself, i counsel newbs to eschew IDEs. In this case of course there's a lot of boilerplate so it's needed i think
15:34 < g00se:#liferay> The first problem is the link you posted: that gives me only one (poss two) choices of bundle
15:35 < jardineworks:#liferay> right, but you said you were using GA4? that's the latest release as far as I know
15:37 < g00se:#liferay> OK. I'll see what i get
15:39 < jardineworks:#liferay> really, the IDE version does't matter -- you just want to make sure the SDK and the <app server> bundle are in synch to avoid problems with changes to the API from release to release.
15:40 < g00se:#liferay> OK. I had to work back to Kepler to avoid crashes though
15:40 < jardineworks:#liferay> sure
15:40 < jardineworks:#liferay> the IDE changes are really just for the toys you get for RAD
15:41 < jardineworks:#liferay> a lot of Liferay developers, including people who work at Liferay no less, use other tools... like Intellij
15:41 < jardineworks:#liferay> you lose all the toys, but if you know what files to change etc, it doesn't matter. And eclipse is shit, sooooooooooooooooo... :)
