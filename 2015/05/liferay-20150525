08:00 < goku_:#liferay> hi, when am trying to cluster liferay6.2-ga2 (with tomcat7 and mysql5 and solr4) . the users are not showing,there where no exceptions on the logs but users are not showing on both nodes.anybody have any idea about this issue?
08:54 < jardineworks:#liferay> goku_, do yo uhave the property lucene.replicate.write=true in the portal-ext.properties file (on both nodes)?
08:59 < ikb:#liferay> is someone here expert about Soaicl Office?
09:10 < goku_:#liferay> jardineworks: yes i have given that ,but still same issue
09:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> goku_, Are you using the disk for storage? or do you have a search server?
09:13 < goku_:#liferay> jardineworks: am using disk for storage and solr4 for search server
09:14 < jardineworks:#liferay> goku_, "sol4 for search server" -- meaning you have a separate server? or you have solr installed on both node using the data/lucene directory as its root data store?
09:16 < goku_:#liferay> i have made the solr as seperate search server
09:18 < goku_:#liferay> jardineworks: and copied the schema.xml file from the solr-web.war(from market place) and copied to the solr-4.10.4/example/solr/collection1/conf/
09:19 < goku_:#liferay> jardineworks: from the liferay documentation i am a bit confused .like do i have to deploy the solr-web.war from the marketplace to both the nodes ..or coping the schema.xml file will do
09:21 < hufg:#liferay> helloo how are you all today
09:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> goku_, ah I see.. ok, so first let's understand how all this plumbinh works.
09:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> goku_, default setup, a single liferay server writes its search data to disk under LIFERAY_HOME/data/lucene/<company-id>
09:22 < jardineworks:#liferay> goku_, Cluster configuration, same thing, BUT there is a listener that detects a write on one node and then send a message (using jgroups) to the other node(s) to tell them to do that same thing -- so your indices should stay synched.
09:23 < jardineworks:#liferay> goku_, Now you introduce a solr search server. This means that you no longer want to use the disk (data/lucene) stuff... and now, you want all the search stuff to be offloaded to the solr server -- including the indexing operations.
09:23 < jardineworks:#liferay> so you need to make sure that BOTH nodes have the same configuration (including plugins) and that both nodes are able to access your external SOLR server.
