03:21 < rom12three:#liferay> how can i prevent liferay from changing my database column clob size from 5M to 1M every time, i make service build..
03:21 < rom12three:#liferay> this deletes all of my data and i have to change the columns manually again by hand

08:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> [ru|de|en]CyberK, I think I used this to solve it -- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10862780/liferay-portal-with-this-webpage-has-a-redirect-loop
08:43 < jardineworks:#liferay> rom12three, have you tried using the portlet-model-hints.xml file to set the size of your column?
08:43 < jardineworks:#liferay> oh... maybe that was the link you sent :)
08:44 < jardineworks:#liferay> rom12three, can you share with us your portlet-model-hints.xml file?
