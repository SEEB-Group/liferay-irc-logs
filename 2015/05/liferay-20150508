08:02 < Cyberkatze:#liferay> Any1 here?
09:48 < ducktype:#liferay> hi
09:49 < ducktype:#liferay> someone can help about renderresponse.setcontenttype() from a portlet?
09:49 < ducktype:#liferay> i'm reading all around that should be supprted in exclusive mode
09:49 < ducktype:#liferay> but still i can't set arbitrary mime types
09:52 < ducktype:#liferay> also reading the actual source code
09:52 < ducktype:#liferay> https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/blob/master/portal-impl/src/com/liferay/portlet/MimeResponseImpl.java
09:52 < ducktype:#liferay> seems it should work
09:52 < ducktype:#liferay> but after 3 days i can't get it to work
09:53 < ducktype:#liferay> i'm setting image/jpeg and i still get text/html;charset=utf8
09:55 < ducktype:#liferay> public void doView(RenderRequest renderRequest, RenderResponse renderResponse) {   renderResponse.setContentType("image/jpeg");   try {      renderResponse.getWriter().write("TEST");   } catch (Exception e2) {} }
09:55 < ducktype:#liferay> i see "TEST" in the output but the content-type is not affected√π
10:21 < ducktype:#liferay> my portlet url is: ?p_p_id=portlet_WAR_portlet&p_p_state=exclusive
10:32 < bijoo_:#liferay> ducktype: "i'm reading all around that should be supprted in exclusive mode" where are you reading that? I am not sure
10:32 < bijoo_:#liferay> ducktype: from top of my head, spec says optional
10:32 < bijoo_:#liferay> ducktype: can't use resource phase to achieve the same?
10:32 < bijoo_:#liferay> e.g. serveResource instead of render
10:35 < ducktype:#liferay> how can i trigger serveResource?
10:35 < ducktype:#liferay> ?p_p_id=portlet_WAR_portlet&p_p_state=exclusive this url always go in doView
10:36 < ducktype:#liferay> i'm reading here: https://www.liferay.com/it/web/raymond.auge/blog/-/blogs/801426
10:36 < ducktype:#liferay> and also in forums where ppl ask for a jsp page to response some pdf
10:38 < ducktype:#liferay> sorry is my first portlet
10:48 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo_, how's your asset publisher experience.
10:54 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo_, I need to make sure that my Asset being rendered on a display page included a prp for the categoryId -- https://www.liferay.com/community/forums/-/message_boards/message/53599635
10:54 < jardineworks:#liferay> any chance you have faced a similar issue?
11:02 < ducktype:#liferay> adding p_p_lifecycle=2 means call the serveResource method on the portlet?
11:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> ducktype, yep
11:05 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: i use AP as starting point portlet
11:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo_, you mean you take that portlet, and then customize it to meet your needs?
11:07 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: no I mean I drop it on the Layout ;) since it aggregates the information
11:07 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: as for custom routes I have not done that
11:07 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: though I'd do same path as you're on: EXT
