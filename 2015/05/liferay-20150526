06:43 < hufg:#liferay> any ideas if a friendly url mapping can be /-/param?
06:44 < hufg:#liferay> without portlet name
07:22 < jardineworks:#liferay> hufg, is this for your custom portlet? or for one of the OOTB portlets?
08:29 < hufg:#liferay> custom
08:29 < hufg:#liferay> or why not both
08:29 < hufg:#liferay> :)
08:30 < hufg:#liferay> anyways let's stick to the custom one first
08:38 < jardineworks:#liferay> hufg, so you are referring to the part that you set in the liferay-portlet.xml right?
08:38 < jardineworks:#liferay> or are you looking to get rid of the /-/
08:39 < hufg:#liferay> a
08:39 < hufg:#liferay> ./-/ is alrgiht but don't want the portlet name or action id
08:39 < hufg:#liferay> it's the portlet-friendlyurlmapping or something
08:39 < hufg:#liferay> i guess it could be possible to dig the /-/param from request perhaps
08:40 < hufg:#liferay> no i take it back
08:40 < hufg:#liferay> ./home/-/ok -->  This portlet has been undeployed. Please redeploy it or remove it from the page.
08:40 < jardineworks:#liferay> the <friendly-url-mapping/> you mean then?
08:40 < hufg:#liferay> yeah
08:40 < hufg:#liferay> i know it can do stuff like /-/portlat-name/action/param
08:41 < jardineworks:#liferay> no, I think you have to have that one. But it doesn't have to be the portlet name ... it can be wahtever you like.
08:41 < jardineworks:#liferay> right
08:41 < hufg:#liferay> the best case scenario would be /-/param
08:41 < jardineworks:#liferay> ... so you can have /-/article/view/this-is-my-article
08:41 < hufg:#liferay> yep
08:42 < hufg:#liferay> i guess i can live with that also
08:42 < jardineworks:#liferay> hufg, hmm.. you might be able to do it with a custom friendly url mapper ... but if you use the default ones, then I don't think you can get around it
08:42 < jardineworks:#liferay> most people complain about the /-/ :)
08:43 < jardineworks:#liferay> you can get rid of that with a custom friendly url mapper for sure
