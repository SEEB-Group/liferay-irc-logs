06:43 < hufg:#liferay> any ideas if a friendly url mapping can be /-/param?
06:44 < hufg:#liferay> without portlet name
07:22 < jardineworks:#liferay> hufg, is this for your custom portlet? or for one of the OOTB portlets?
08:29 < hufg:#liferay> custom
08:29 < hufg:#liferay> or why not both
08:29 < hufg:#liferay> :)
08:30 < hufg:#liferay> anyways let's stick to the custom one first
08:38 < jardineworks:#liferay> hufg, so you are referring to the part that you set in the liferay-portlet.xml right?
08:38 < jardineworks:#liferay> or are you looking to get rid of the /-/
08:39 < hufg:#liferay> a
08:39 < hufg:#liferay> ./-/ is alrgiht but don't want the portlet name or action id
08:39 < hufg:#liferay> it's the portlet-friendlyurlmapping or something
08:39 < hufg:#liferay> i guess it could be possible to dig the /-/param from request perhaps
08:40 < hufg:#liferay> no i take it back
08:40 < hufg:#liferay> ./home/-/ok -->  This portlet has been undeployed. Please redeploy it or remove it from the page.
08:40 < jardineworks:#liferay> the <friendly-url-mapping/> you mean then?
08:40 < hufg:#liferay> yeah
08:40 < hufg:#liferay> i know it can do stuff like /-/portlat-name/action/param
08:41 < jardineworks:#liferay> no, I think you have to have that one. But it doesn't have to be the portlet name ... it can be wahtever you like.
08:41 < jardineworks:#liferay> right
08:41 < hufg:#liferay> the best case scenario would be /-/param
08:41 < jardineworks:#liferay> ... so you can have /-/article/view/this-is-my-article
08:41 < hufg:#liferay> yep
08:42 < hufg:#liferay> i guess i can live with that also
08:42 < jardineworks:#liferay> hufg, hmm.. you might be able to do it with a custom friendly url mapper ... but if you use the default ones, then I don't think you can get around it
08:42 < jardineworks:#liferay> most people complain about the /-/ :)
08:43 < jardineworks:#liferay> you can get rid of that with a custom friendly url mapper for sure
08:43 < hufg:#liferay> oh hmm that would be neat
08:43 < hufg:#liferay> i think the /-/ is pretty innocous (is that a word? :D)
08:43 < jardineworks:#liferay> lemme double check.. might be a property for it soo...
08:43 < hufg:#liferay> innocent anyhow
08:43 < jardineworks:#liferay> hufg, true, but it's annoying.
08:44 < jardineworks:#liferay> article/-/article/view/this-is-my-article.
08:44 < hufg:#liferay> well yeah but it's basicly nothing article/article/view/my-article
08:44 < hufg:#liferay> doesn't change much
08:45 < hufg:#liferay> in my case the other stuff is more annoying 8)
08:45 < jardineworks:#liferay> haha fair point
08:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> but I agree... it
08:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> s annoying.
08:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> like this -- https://www.sprouts.com/article/content/-/article-details/view/22235446/your-guide-to-grilling-up-greatness
08:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> why not just /article/content/view/...
08:47 < jardineworks:#liferay> article is the page, content is the friendly-url-mapping, article-details is the route.
08:48 < hufg:#liferay> hehe
08:48 < hufg:#liferay> without reading too much into it, i think you can do it with a custom url mapper
08:49 < jardineworks:#liferay> yeah, I dug pretty deep into the heart or the URL mapper with topolik for that project... but it was almost 2 years ago now. I can't remember what I found :)
08:50 < hufg:#liferay> hmm though
08:50 < hufg:#liferay> there is the asset publisher stuff with domain.com/-/article
08:50 < hufg:#liferay> it probably won't collide with that
08:57 < hufg:#liferay> yeah and the mapper needs to be triggered with /-/param

10:00 <@jhf:#liferay> and on google hangouts
10:17 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> hey
11:28 < josuebc:#liferay> Hi there, I was wondering if there's any way to force the login portlet to not show maximized?. I was able to do it almos on every action except when a user clicks on a private link and their session has expired.
11:28 < josuebc:#liferay> LR will redirct the user to the login portlet MAXIMIZED. How can I redirect the user to the login page without the login portlet being MAXIMIZED?
11:48 <@jhf:#liferay> BTW all - we are starting a new effort to get more questions answered on the forums - so josuebc if you don't hear anything here, try the forums!
12:19 < g00se:#liferay> jardineworks: That was interesting. Of course as part of my immersion in Liferay, that would count as the deep end of the pool
12:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> g00se, lol
12:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> I think you might be surprised how quickly yoou can get there.
12:26 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> @josuebc - maybe do own login page ? )
12:28 < jardineworks:#liferay> josuebc, I wonder if you created a portlet struts action override and in the method changes the portlet url to use NORMAL instead of MAXIMIZED?
12:40 < g00se:#liferay> Why btw do i see these leading underscores in variable names? Typical: _log
12:42 < jardineworks:#liferay> g00se, because I am an old programmer and there was a time when the convention was to put _ in front of private variables :)
12:43 < jardineworks:#liferay> I still do it... I like the convention -- I don't care what these new kids do ;)
12:45 < g00se:#liferay> I thought that was a Liferay thing ;)
12:45 < jardineworks:#liferay> g00se, Liferay has been around a while -- probably dating back to the convention :)
12:45 < jardineworks:#liferay> and there are some old farts like me that work at Liferay
12:51 < josuebc:#liferay> jardineworks: I did that for when the password is not correct or anything else.
12:51 < josuebc:#liferay> The issue is that it doesn't go through that action when the user clicks on a link and the session is no longer valid.
12:52 < jardineworks:#liferay> josuebc, which struts action did you override?
12:53 < josuebc:#liferay> jardineworks: Let me check, I can't remember. I did that a while back
12:54 < jardineworks:#liferay> josuebc, do you have a proxy?
12:54 < josuebc:#liferay> jardineworks: Do you mean for you to check my running instance?
12:54 < jardineworks:#liferay> josuebc, maybe a re-write rule for that url to replace MAXIMIZED with NORMAL? :)
