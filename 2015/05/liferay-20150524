08:22 < Hisham:#liferay> hi guys, I'm new to liferay
08:22 < Hisham:#liferay> I'm trying to use eclipse for creating portlet
08:25 < Hisham:#liferay> When I choose to create portlet some message comes says "There's no suitable liferay plugin available for this liferay portlet..."  Then when I choose to use ant and portlet mvc and click on finish, it took long time to run and at the end there's no result
08:25 < Hisham:#liferay> which means it's not working
08:25 < Hisham:#liferay> I wana know why it's not working ?
08:25 < Hisham:#liferay> I have the same that in the tutorial with no luck
09:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> Hisham, are you using the ANT sdk or Maven to generate your projects?
09:05 < Hisham:#liferay> jardineworks, I'm using ant sdk for generating the project
09:05 < Hisham:#liferay> jardineworks, thanks for replying to me
09:06 < jardineworks:#liferay> Hisham, np -- on and which version of the IDE/LR are you using? GA4?
09:06 < Hisham:#liferay> the latest version for all
09:06 < Hisham:#liferay> jardineworks, the latest version
09:07 < Hisham:#liferay> jardineworks, yes GA4
09:07 < jardineworks:#liferay> Hisham, ok -- there are a few bugs with the IDE that are a pain. Let's try from the command line first.
09:07 < jardineworks:#liferay> which OS are you on?
09:07 < Hisham:#liferay> jardineworks, windows
09:08 < Hisham:#liferay> 8.1
09:08 < jardineworks:#liferay> ok -- open a poweshell and navigate to the folder where you unpacked the SDK
09:08 < jardineworks:#liferay> in there, have you created a file called build.<username>.properties? (where username is the name you use to log into your machine)
09:09 < Hisham:#liferay> jardineworks, OK, I saw that
09:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> so you have that file done then?
09:10 < Hisham:#liferay> yes, I see that file
09:10 < Hisham:#liferay> jardineworks, build.Hisham.properties
09:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> ok great.
09:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> I'm going to refer to this location as SDK_HOME from now on.
09:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> navigate into SDK_HOME/portlets
09:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> and then try creating a porlet from the command line with the command C:>create.bat my "My Test Portlet"
09:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> you don't need to specify portlet for the first argument... it should create a portlet project for you called my-portlet.
09:13 < Hisham:#liferay> jardineworks, create.bat my "C:\\liferay-project\test"
09:13 < Hisham:#liferay> will this gona be OK
09:13 < Hisham:#liferay> ?
09:14 < jardineworks:#liferay> no
09:14 < Hisham:#liferay> jardineworks, and what my means?
09:14 < jardineworks:#liferay> the second parameter s the title for the portlet.
09:14 < jardineworks:#liferay> you can leave it blank if yo ulike...
09:14 < jardineworks:#liferay> but it should be the "name of the portlet" you are creating (normally)
09:14 < Hisham:#liferay> jardineworks, create.bat FirstPortlet "C:\\liferay-project\test"
09:14 < jardineworks:#liferay> you can always change it later though
09:14 < Hisham:#liferay> like that ?
09:14 < jardineworks:#liferay> no
09:14 < jardineworks:#liferay> create.bat first "First Portlet"
09:16 < Hisham:#liferay> jardineworks, the title is "FirstPortlet" and the location is "C;\\liferay-project\test"
09:16 < jardineworks:#liferay> no
09:16 < jardineworks:#liferay> dude
09:16 < jardineworks:#liferay> lol
09:16 < jardineworks:#liferay> just run what I gave you
09:16 < jardineworks:#liferay> the first parameter is the name of the portlet directory... it will automatically be created inside SDK_HOME/portlets and the second (optional) parameter is the title.
09:17 < jardineworks:#liferay> when you are usin gthe SDK you have to have your portlets inside the SDK_HOME for the ant build files.
09:17 < Hisham:#liferay> jardineworks, OK, I have start it
09:17 < jardineworks:#liferay> ok -- so in your directory now, do you see a new folder?
09:17 < jardineworks:#liferay> with the first parameter-portlet
09:18 < Hisham:#liferay> jardineworks, if you mean inside the portlet folder not yet
09:18 < jardineworks:#liferay> i do... it should take literally less than a second.
09:18 < jardineworks:#liferay> was there a BUILD ERROR?
09:19 < Hisham:#liferay> jardineworks, yes now "first-portlet"
09:19 < jardineworks:#liferay> ok
09:19 < jardineworks:#liferay> great!
09:19 < Hisham:#liferay> jardineworks, finished succesful
09:19 < jardineworks:#liferay> so now go inti the IDE
09:19 < jardineworks:#liferay> into*
