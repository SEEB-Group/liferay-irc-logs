08:22 < Hisham:#liferay> hi guys, I'm new to liferay
08:22 < Hisham:#liferay> I'm trying to use eclipse for creating portlet
08:25 < Hisham:#liferay> When I choose to create portlet some message comes says "There's no suitable liferay plugin available for this liferay portlet..."  Then when I choose to use ant and portlet mvc and click on finish, it took long time to run and at the end there's no result
08:25 < Hisham:#liferay> which means it's not working
08:25 < Hisham:#liferay> I wana know why it's not working ?
08:25 < Hisham:#liferay> I have the same that in the tutorial with no luck
09:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> Hisham, are you using the ANT sdk or Maven to generate your projects?
09:05 < Hisham:#liferay> jardineworks, I'm using ant sdk for generating the project
09:05 < Hisham:#liferay> jardineworks, thanks for replying to me
09:06 < jardineworks:#liferay> Hisham, np -- on and which version of the IDE/LR are you using? GA4?
09:06 < Hisham:#liferay> the latest version for all
09:06 < Hisham:#liferay> jardineworks, the latest version
09:07 < Hisham:#liferay> jardineworks, yes GA4
09:07 < jardineworks:#liferay> Hisham, ok -- there are a few bugs with the IDE that are a pain. Let's try from the command line first.
09:07 < jardineworks:#liferay> which OS are you on?
09:07 < Hisham:#liferay> jardineworks, windows
09:08 < Hisham:#liferay> 8.1
09:08 < jardineworks:#liferay> ok -- open a poweshell and navigate to the folder where you unpacked the SDK
09:08 < jardineworks:#liferay> in there, have you created a file called build.<username>.properties? (where username is the name you use to log into your machine)
09:09 < Hisham:#liferay> jardineworks, OK, I saw that
09:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> so you have that file done then?
09:10 < Hisham:#liferay> yes, I see that file
09:10 < Hisham:#liferay> jardineworks, build.Hisham.properties
09:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> ok great.
09:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> I'm going to refer to this location as SDK_HOME from now on.
09:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> navigate into SDK_HOME/portlets
09:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> and then try creating a porlet from the command line with the command C:>create.bat my "My Test Portlet"
09:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> you don't need to specify portlet for the first argument... it should create a portlet project for you called my-portlet.
09:13 < Hisham:#liferay> jardineworks, create.bat my "C:\\liferay-project\test"
09:13 < Hisham:#liferay> will this gona be OK
09:13 < Hisham:#liferay> ?
09:14 < jardineworks:#liferay> no
09:14 < Hisham:#liferay> jardineworks, and what my means?
09:14 < jardineworks:#liferay> the second parameter s the title for the portlet.
09:14 < jardineworks:#liferay> you can leave it blank if yo ulike...
09:14 < jardineworks:#liferay> but it should be the "name of the portlet" you are creating (normally)
09:14 < Hisham:#liferay> jardineworks, create.bat FirstPortlet "C:\\liferay-project\test"
09:14 < jardineworks:#liferay> you can always change it later though
09:14 < Hisham:#liferay> like that ?
09:14 < jardineworks:#liferay> no
09:14 < jardineworks:#liferay> create.bat first "First Portlet"
09:16 < Hisham:#liferay> jardineworks, the title is "FirstPortlet" and the location is "C;\\liferay-project\test"
09:16 < jardineworks:#liferay> no
09:16 < jardineworks:#liferay> dude
09:16 < jardineworks:#liferay> lol
09:16 < jardineworks:#liferay> just run what I gave you
09:16 < jardineworks:#liferay> the first parameter is the name of the portlet directory... it will automatically be created inside SDK_HOME/portlets and the second (optional) parameter is the title.
09:17 < jardineworks:#liferay> when you are usin gthe SDK you have to have your portlets inside the SDK_HOME for the ant build files.
09:17 < Hisham:#liferay> jardineworks, OK, I have start it
09:17 < jardineworks:#liferay> ok -- so in your directory now, do you see a new folder?
09:17 < jardineworks:#liferay> with the first parameter-portlet
09:18 < Hisham:#liferay> jardineworks, if you mean inside the portlet folder not yet
09:18 < jardineworks:#liferay> i do... it should take literally less than a second.
09:18 < jardineworks:#liferay> was there a BUILD ERROR?
09:19 < Hisham:#liferay> jardineworks, yes now "first-portlet"
09:19 < jardineworks:#liferay> ok
09:19 < jardineworks:#liferay> great!
09:19 < Hisham:#liferay> jardineworks, finished succesful
09:19 < jardineworks:#liferay> so now go inti the IDE
09:19 < jardineworks:#liferay> into*
09:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> make sure you are using the "Liferay Persective"
09:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> if you are, then there will be context menu options that are specific to Liferay
09:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> choose File > New > Import Exiting Liferay Plugin Project...
09:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> and then navigate to your first-portlet folder (inside it) and hit ok
09:21 < Hisham:#liferay> jardineworks, Now I should import it right?
09:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> don't using File > Import
09:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> use File > New ? Import existing Liferay ...
09:22 < jardineworks:#liferay> did it work?
09:23 < jardineworks:#liferay> if you don't see that option, then you are not in the Liferay perspective.. in which case you need to use Window > Open persepctive and then find the Liferay one.
09:23 < Hisham:#liferay> I saw other option then I selected from liferay
09:24 < Hisham:#liferay> import "liferay project from existing source"
09:24 < jardineworks:#liferay> sure
09:24 < jardineworks:#liferay> probab;y the same thing
09:24 < jardineworks:#liferay> ok great...
09:24 < Hisham:#liferay> I have choosen this and it did import the project to me
09:25 < jardineworks:#liferay> now you should be able to create the projects in the IDE though. Did you ever configure the IDE with the Liferay SDK location?
09:26 < Hisham:#liferay> yes, I did
09:26 < Hisham:#liferay> can I have your email jardineworks
09:26 < Hisham:#liferay> I have more question about the theme and other stuff, if you don't mind?
09:27 < Hisham:#liferay> I have to go now
09:28 < jardineworks:#liferay> I have to go to... I offer Liferay services for a living but I help out in here and on the forums. Try and find me in those places and I'll help out when I have time
09:28 < jardineworks:#liferay> I have ti eat too... I only give my email out to clients who fulfill invoices :)
09:28 < Hisham:#liferay> jardineworks, I forgot to thank you
09:28 < Hisham:#liferay> jardineworks, so thanks
09:28 < jardineworks:#liferay> no worries, always happy to help when I have time. Liferay is a great product.
09:28 < jardineworks:#liferay> ttyl
09:28 < jardineworks:#liferay> (time to teach my son to ride a bike on 2 wheels ;) )
19:34 < g00se:#liferay> Anyone know how far i have to go back in bundled IDEs to get *pre* Eclipse Luna?
