12:53 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey jhf can I use the serviceLocator in a freemarker theme init_custom.ftl?
12:53 <@jhf:#liferay> not sure.. I've never done a freemarker theme.. I think you have access to it though.
12:54 <@jhf:#liferay> or utilLocator
12:54 < jardineworks:#liferay> this doesn't give me any trouble ... <#assign RoleLocalService = serviceLocator.findService("com.liferay.portal.service.RoleLocalService")/>
12:54 < jardineworks:#liferay> but as soon as I tried to use the object, it goes bananas... which I guess means that it didn't locate the service maybe
12:56 <@jhf:#liferay> hmm no if it returns anything it should be the right thing
12:56 <@jhf:#liferay> try to see what methods the object has.. something like <#list service?keys as key>${key}<p></#list>
12:56 <@jhf:#liferay> the "keys" builtin tells you all callable things of that object
12:57 <@jhf:#liferay> <#list RoleLocalService?keys as key> ${key} <p> </#list>
12:59 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, cool! ... ok I can see my fetchRole ... which is supposed to take a companyId, roleName...
12:59 < jardineworks:#liferay> errr... unless there is more than one defined.
13:02 < jardineworks:#liferay> nope -- just the one it seems
13:03 <@jhf:#liferay> if the value returned from fetchRole is null then FM will fail and refuse to assign it to whatever you're tryinf to assign it too
13:03 <@jhf:#liferay> so you need to do something like <#assign foo = RoleLocalService.fetch(blah, blah)!null />
13:04 <@jhf:#liferay> err not null
13:04 <@jhf:#liferay> just put a ! at the end
13:04 <@jhf:#liferay> here's one from the other day I used: <#assign user = userService.getUserByScreenName(companyId, screenName)! >
13:04 <@jhf:#liferay> then I said <#if user?? && user?has_content > ...... </#if>
13:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> ah -- I got it. I switched to another method... but was using the wrong parameter, etc. PEBKAC :)
13:06 < jardineworks:#liferay> ah ok -- that makes it more robust.
13:06 < jardineworks:#liferay> I'll do that
14:27 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey jhf do you know if anyone has reported issues with EXT plugins and this error {code="500", msg="No action instance for path /portal/layout could be created", uri=/}
14:45 <@jhf:#liferay> nope .. not heard that one
14:45 <@jhf:#liferay> EXT...EXT.... ugh
14:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, dude.. I have no choice. I need to override the PortalImpl
14:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> and the fix works perfectly... I even made a control panel portlet for creating virtual host alias records!
14:52 < jardineworks:#liferay> .. but now I am finding that, only with the EXT plugin installed, it seems to, eventually, corrupt the portal-service.jsr.
14:52 < jardineworks:#liferay> jar*
14:52 < jardineworks:#liferay> the only fix seems to be to reinstall the bundle.
