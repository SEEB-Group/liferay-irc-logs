02:49 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> hi ! Problem with private messaging and msg sending from A to B. Post is here : https://www.liferay.com/fr/community/forums/-/message_boards/message/54012659. If you can help it would be a relief :)
03:16 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> morning
03:44 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> Does someone know how to programmatically add a portlet to user's private page ?
03:44 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> (and create a private page for user if it doesn't exist)
04:01 < Axxell:#liferay> Hello fellow mamals, problem: I have given rights for some teams to edit specific web content articles, this works but for one specific user the "edit" icon below the web content is invisible. I have come to the conclusion that for some reason the dit controls toggle i set to invisible for that user, but because the toggle edit control icon is not shown, its state can not be changed
04:01 < Axxell:#liferay> all other users work as they are supposed to
04:01 < Axxell:#liferay> ie they get their edit icons where they have rights to edit
04:12 < Axxell:#liferay> Anyone seen something like that?
04:20 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> Axxell: no sorry
04:24 < Axxell:#liferay> nicolas_FR: thanks for the answer anyways, cant just find what could cause the edit control to get the css class .controls-hidden
04:27 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> Axxell: btw what I did is add a class to the body container by checking the role of the current user
04:28 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> and then added some css to customize my display regarding this class
04:28 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> (I wanted to add some text in empty layouts zone for admins only)
