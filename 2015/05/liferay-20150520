02:49 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> hi ! Problem with private messaging and msg sending from A to B. Post is here : https://www.liferay.com/fr/community/forums/-/message_boards/message/54012659. If you can help it would be a relief :)
03:16 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> morning
03:44 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> Does someone know how to programmatically add a portlet to user's private page ?
03:44 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> (and create a private page for user if it doesn't exist)
04:01 < Axxell:#liferay> Hello fellow mamals, problem: I have given rights for some teams to edit specific web content articles, this works but for one specific user the "edit" icon below the web content is invisible. I have come to the conclusion that for some reason the dit controls toggle i set to invisible for that user, but because the toggle edit control icon is not shown, its state can not be changed
04:01 < Axxell:#liferay> all other users work as they are supposed to
04:01 < Axxell:#liferay> ie they get their edit icons where they have rights to edit
04:12 < Axxell:#liferay> Anyone seen something like that?
04:20 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> Axxell: no sorry
04:24 < Axxell:#liferay> nicolas_FR: thanks for the answer anyways, cant just find what could cause the edit control to get the css class .controls-hidden
04:27 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> Axxell: btw what I did is add a class to the body container by checking the role of the current user
04:28 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> and then added some css to customize my display regarding this class
04:28 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> (I wanted to add some text in empty layouts zone for admins only)
04:29 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> so in my init_custom.vm in my theme I have : #if ($is_signed_in && $isAdmin) 	#set ($css_class = "$css_class isAdmin") #end
04:29 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> (note the "isAdmin" added)
04:31 < Axxell:#liferay> ok, yeah well the strange thing is that it is functioning as intended for all other users.. tested also users dashboard, for some reason the edit controls go to invisible, with every refresh and do not persist
