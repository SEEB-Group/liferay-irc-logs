09:33 < jardineworks:#liferay> abeym_, lol -- why?
10:00 < Andrea_:#liferay> hi all, how can add pages whenever a dashboard is created?
10:01 < Andrea_:#liferay> for example, i need the dashboard of every user to have a page called RIL, how can I achieve this?
10:07 < jardineworks:#liferay> Andrea_, every user will have a page (a private one) created for them when they are created. This is enabled by default.
10:07 < jardineworks:#liferay> I think the url to get to it is /user/<userid> by default.
10:08 < Andrea_:#liferay> hi jardine! But i need that whenever a user is created, 2 pages are created in dashboard ( the welcome page + another page)
10:09 < Andrea_:#liferay> Any easy way to do this?
10:15 < jardineworks:#liferay> Andrea_, I suspect you would need to use the API (Layout section) and create a model listener hook for the onAfterCreate event for a user.
10:17 < Andrea_:#liferay> damn thats not so easy, may I ask you a couple of things? i'm doing the last customization to end this thesis
10:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> sure
10:23 < Andrea_:#liferay> Do you remember the method to let HR Role edit some field that you made? well i needed to add that logic to all fields of myaccount portlet so i put that method in the init-ext.jsp so the variable editAllowed could be viewed in all myaccount jsps, then i added, via ext plugin, a section called Documenti where i need to put ID card
10:25 < Andrea_:#liferay> now the id card is a text box custom field, but i need it to have 4 different fields: Number, Date of release,expiration date, type(it can be driving license or passport or id card)
10:25 < Andrea_:#liferay> what is the most simple way to achieve what i need?
10:28 < jardineworks:#liferay> Andrea_, you added a new section you said right? so... on that jsp, you add all 4 fields. Then to save them you need to write a StrutsAction hook to override the "save" button... use the originalStrutsAction to maintain OOTB functionality and then add logic to save your 4 fields.
10:31 < Andrea_:#liferay> do i need to know struts?
10:36 < Andrea_:#liferay> i'm asking because i really don't know what strutsActions are..
10:40 < jardineworks:#liferay> Andrea_, you need to read the docs
10:40 < jardineworks:#liferay> Andrea_, https://www.liferay.com/documentation/liferay-portal/6.1/development/-/ai/lp-6-1-dgen06-overriding-and-adding-struts-actions-0
10:41 < Andrea_:#liferay> ok, thanks jardine. Do i find there also a way to save in a database these fields?
10:42 < Andrea_:#liferay> i guess i will have to create a new database for those fields, am i wrong?
10:49 < jardineworks:#liferay> Andrea_, I would just use ExpandoAttributes.
10:49 < jardineworks:#liferay> on the User object.
10:52 < Andrea_:#liferay> then why can't i just override the jsp page and add those fields?
10:53 < jardineworks:#liferay> Andrea_, override the custom attributes?
10:54 < jardineworks:#liferay> If you add the custom attribtues (ExpandoValues) then they should just appear there.
10:54 < Andrea_:#liferay> I already did it with , for example, the place of birth. I put the customField "Place of birth" in the details jsp with this tag
10:54 < Andrea_:#liferay> <liferay-ui:custom-attribute
10:55 < Andrea_:#liferay> and everything works fine, when i compile that field and click save, it will be saved
10:56 < jardineworks:#liferay> Andrea_, which jsp are you editing?
10:57 < jardineworks:#liferay> Andrea_, the one that the first name, last name, email address etc exist on?
10:57 < Andrea_:#liferay> well, documents are on another jsp i did
10:57 < Andrea_:#liferay> in the ext plugin, but place of birth is on details jsp
10:58 < Andrea_:#liferay> yes, that one with first name, birthday etc
10:59 < jardineworks:#liferay> so what happens if you add the additional fields?
11:00 < Andrea_:#liferay> http://i.gyazo.com/8f6ebbd74d027c46baf35b09152a2c6e.png
11:00 < Andrea_:#liferay> everything works fine! they are saved when i click save
11:01 < Andrea_:#liferay> in the screenshots you can see "Tipo di collaborazione" "luogo di nascita"
11:01 < Andrea_:#liferay> they are custom fields i put in the jsp details
11:02 < Andrea_:#liferay> i did not touched any strutsAction or similar
11:02 < Andrea_:#liferay> also "stato civile" is a custom field*
11:02 < jardineworks:#liferay> perfect.. that looks and sounds fine!
11:02 < jardineworks:#liferay> I didn't realize you were using the taglibs :)
11:04 < Andrea_:#liferay> i took the idea because by default you have Custom Fields section that is just a jsp with one tag
11:05 < Andrea_:#liferay> so, also if i already have 4 custom fields you would still suggest to add 4 more for the identification documents?
11:07 < jardineworks:#liferay> if that's all you need.. why not.
11:08 < Andrea_:#liferay> perfect!! The last thing and i'm done
11:08 < Andrea_:#liferay> in my account portlet, in the addresses tag
11:09 < Andrea_:#liferay> there is a checkbox labeled Mailing
11:09 < Andrea_:#liferay> i need to change that label
11:10 < Andrea_:#liferay> I was thinking about editing a language_en and language_it property
11:10 < Andrea_:#liferay> but i cant find the right value to override
11:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> Andrea_, In the language_en.properties I can see -- mailing=Mailing
11:12 < Andrea_:#liferay> i'm such a noob, where can i read that files??
11:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> Andrea_, https://www.liferay.com/documentation/liferay-portal/6.0/development/-/ai/overriding-a-language-properties-file
11:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> and then add your value
11:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> with the same key
11:12 < Andrea_:#liferay> yeah i did with some key, but i had to find the key in the jsp
11:13 < Andrea_:#liferay> where can i find that name->value file for language properties?
11:13 < jardineworks:#liferay> Andrea_, you can look for it in the JSP as well... normally I just go to the language file in the portal-impl project (in the Liferay source code) and find the label that is being displayed.
11:14 < Andrea_:#liferay> ok, so you downloaded the source code of liferay and imported the project in eclipse?
11:15 < Andrea_:#liferay> the real question is , how do you explore liferay source code actually?
11:36 < jardineworks:#liferay> Andrea_, precisely... yo udownload it and then import it as a java project into eclipse
11:36 < jardineworks:#liferay> or you can use the github repo... just be sure to use the correct branch, The master is 7.0
