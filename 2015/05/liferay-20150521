09:33 < jardineworks:#liferay> abeym_, lol -- why?
10:00 < Andrea_:#liferay> hi all, how can add pages whenever a dashboard is created?
10:01 < Andrea_:#liferay> for example, i need the dashboard of every user to have a page called RIL, how can I achieve this?
10:07 < jardineworks:#liferay> Andrea_, every user will have a page (a private one) created for them when they are created. This is enabled by default.
10:07 < jardineworks:#liferay> I think the url to get to it is /user/<userid> by default.
10:08 < Andrea_:#liferay> hi jardine! But i need that whenever a user is created, 2 pages are created in dashboard ( the welcome page + another page)
10:09 < Andrea_:#liferay> Any easy way to do this?
10:15 < jardineworks:#liferay> Andrea_, I suspect you would need to use the API (Layout section) and create a model listener hook for the onAfterCreate event for a user.
10:17 < Andrea_:#liferay> damn thats not so easy, may I ask you a couple of things? i'm doing the last customization to end this thesis
10:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> sure
10:23 < Andrea_:#liferay> Do you remember the method to let HR Role edit some field that you made? well i needed to add that logic to all fields of myaccount portlet so i put that method in the init-ext.jsp so the variable editAllowed could be viewed in all myaccount jsps, then i added, via ext plugin, a section called Documenti where i need to put ID card
10:25 < Andrea_:#liferay> now the id card is a text box custom field, but i need it to have 4 different fields: Number, Date of release,expiration date, type(it can be driving license or passport or id card)
10:25 < Andrea_:#liferay> what is the most simple way to achieve what i need?
10:28 < jardineworks:#liferay> Andrea_, you added a new section you said right? so... on that jsp, you add all 4 fields. Then to save them you need to write a StrutsAction hook to override the "save" button... use the originalStrutsAction to maintain OOTB functionality and then add logic to save your 4 fields.
10:31 < Andrea_:#liferay> do i need to know struts?
10:36 < Andrea_:#liferay> i'm asking because i really don't know what strutsActions are..
10:40 < jardineworks:#liferay> Andrea_, you need to read the docs
10:40 < jardineworks:#liferay> Andrea_, https://www.liferay.com/documentation/liferay-portal/6.1/development/-/ai/lp-6-1-dgen06-overriding-and-adding-struts-actions-0
10:41 < Andrea_:#liferay> ok, thanks jardine. Do i find there also a way to save in a database these fields?
10:42 < Andrea_:#liferay> i guess i will have to create a new database for those fields, am i wrong?
10:49 < jardineworks:#liferay> Andrea_, I would just use ExpandoAttributes.
10:49 < jardineworks:#liferay> on the User object.
10:52 < Andrea_:#liferay> then why can't i just override the jsp page and add those fields?
10:53 < jardineworks:#liferay> Andrea_, override the custom attributes?
10:54 < jardineworks:#liferay> If you add the custom attribtues (ExpandoValues) then they should just appear there.
10:54 < Andrea_:#liferay> I already did it with , for example, the place of birth. I put the customField "Place of birth" in the details jsp with this tag
