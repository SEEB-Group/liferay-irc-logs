10:41 < CyberKatze:#liferay> hi all
11:59 < Andrea____:#liferay> Hi all, how can i make fields like lastName obligatory when creating an account?
12:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> Andrea____,
12:05 < jardineworks:#liferay>     #
12:05 < jardineworks:#liferay>     # Set this to true if you want the last name to be required when creating
12:05 < jardineworks:#liferay>     # users.
12:05 < jardineworks:#liferay>     #
12:05 < jardineworks:#liferay>     users.last.name.required=false
12:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> set that to true in your portal-ext.properties and restart
12:07 < Andrea____:#liferay> hi jardine, thanks for the fast response as always! can i do that for every field in that portlet?
12:13 < jardineworks:#liferay> I don't think so
12:13 < jardineworks:#liferay> Andrea____, check the portal.properties file...
12:13 < jardineworks:#liferay> oone sec
12:14 < Andrea____:#liferay> https://docs.liferay.com/portal/6.2/propertiesdoc/portal.properties.html this right?
12:14 < jardineworks:#liferay> https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/blob/6.2.x/portal-impl/src/portal.properties
12:14 < jardineworks:#liferay> search for
12:14 < jardineworks:#liferay> ## Users
12:14 < Andrea____:#liferay> how can i know if something can be simply done with properties or I have to implement a solution?
12:28 < Andrea____:#liferay> and what solution would you suggest for fields i can't mark as required from properties?
12:40 < jardineworks:#liferay> Andrea____, well, I think you would have to do soemthing similar to that other hook you wrote. Create properties following the same convention -- users.email.address.required=  -- and then in you jsp hook add PrefsPropsUtil.getBoolean(companyId, "property-name-here"); and based on the boolean determine whether or not to set required=true on the aui field.
12:43 < Andrea____:#liferay> thanks for the input, i'll work on this
17:14 < urug_:#liferay> hi, anyone?
