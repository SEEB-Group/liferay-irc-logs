11:59 < Andrea____:#liferay> Hi all, how can i make fields like lastName obligatory when creating an account?
12:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> Andrea____,
12:05 < jardineworks:#liferay>     #
12:05 < jardineworks:#liferay>     # Set this to true if you want the last name to be required when creating
12:05 < jardineworks:#liferay>     # users.
12:05 < jardineworks:#liferay>     #
12:05 < jardineworks:#liferay>     users.last.name.required=false
