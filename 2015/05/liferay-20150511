04:57 < Andrea___:#liferay> hi all, i have a custom field "place of birth" and i want it to be shown under the job title in the my account portlet, and not in the Custom Fields jsp. how can i do this?
05:21 < Andrea___:#liferay> nobody?
08:15 < Andrea___:#liferay> hi all, anyone connected?
09:06 < twen:#liferay> Hello
09:07 < twen:#liferay> doens anybody know what PDF metadata field are mapped to any Liferay Metadata ? (except author and title)
09:27 < Andrea___:#liferay> twen are you still here?
09:29 < twen:#liferay> yup Andrea___
09:30 < twen:#liferay> Andrea___ There is not always a lot of trafic here.. But sometimes it can be different ;)
09:39 < Andrea___:#liferay> i'm trying to customize the My Account portlet, for example i'm trying to show custom fields in the account details, where first name is shown, how can i do this?
09:49 < jardineworks:#liferay> Andrea___, I think there is a taglib for expando attributes.
09:49 < jardineworks:#liferay> you could hook the jsp for MyAccount and add the field,
10:35 < Andrea___:#liferay> hi jardine
10:35 < Andrea___:#liferay> sorry if i asked this before, but i am finding a lot of difficulties in searching the right JSP to override
10:36 < Andrea___:#liferay> i know i can use a taglib for expando , but i can't figure where to put that code
10:36 < Andrea___:#liferay> I dont understand the jsp nesting in liferay
10:37 < Andrea___:#liferay> for example , the last time you helped me, you found that the jsp to hook was details_user_name, how did you know it?
11:02 < jardineworks:#liferay> Andrea___, do you have the source code for the portal downloaded onto your machine?
11:04 < Andrea___:#liferay> yes
11:04 < Andrea___:#liferay> in zip format
11:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> unzip it
11:06 < jardineworks:#liferay> look for the folder portal-web
11:06 < jardineworks:#liferay>  /html/portlet/admin contains a lot of the stuff from the control panel
11:07 < Andrea___:#liferay> ok, i'm viewing it
11:08 < Andrea___:#liferay> watching
11:11 < Andrea___:#liferay> but i still cannot figure how to know which jsps are involved to make this http://gyazo.com/4702a6ef260fd4b5469b146be6cf5b75
11:45 < Andrea___:#liferay> hey jardine, i think i disconnected,..did you replied ?
11:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> Andrea___, no sorry -- super busy today so I can't really help out. But the code is there, just start combing over it -- light bulbs will start to come on eventually.
11:47 < Andrea___:#liferay> okey, good work!

13:50 < modd:#liferay> recompile?
13:51 < modd:#liferay> if you want to change a class, you could do a EXT-plugin
