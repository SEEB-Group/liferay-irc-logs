04:12 < kravigupta:#liferay> rocknroll_.. how about writing a blog post about it or a wiki so everyone gets help when needed. :)
04:24 < rocknroll_:#liferay> yes, my thoughts exactly :)
04:24 < rocknroll_:#liferay> took a lot of work getting all the details
04:41 < kravigupta:#liferay> :)
05:06 < kravigupta:#liferay> Guys.. When and why would you create an empty entity in service.xml?
05:16 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> hi there, I would like to add a nickname to users. So I created a custom-field in the user object in liferay control panel. Now I want to display this custom-field in the message board user display tag (replacing firstname and lastname display). Can I refer to <liferay-ui-custom-attribute/> when I'm already in <liferay-ui:user_display/> ?
05:17 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> I was thinking I could hook the start.jsp from html/taglib/ui/user_display and add a <liferay-ui:custom-attribute/> into the page.
05:21 < kravigupta:#liferay> I believe you can do that, did you try?
06:03 < urug_:#liferay> Content Administration - Browse by Structure works only for administrators, for others the filtered content (except for base Web Content Article) does not show up. There is a fixed jira issue, but fix is targeted for LF 7. I am looking for some workaround on LF 6.2 GA4. Either some fix by hook or by alternative solution for filtering content in a reasonable way
