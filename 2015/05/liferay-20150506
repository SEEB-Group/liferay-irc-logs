04:12 < kravigupta:#liferay> rocknroll_.. how about writing a blog post about it or a wiki so everyone gets help when needed. :)
04:24 < rocknroll_:#liferay> yes, my thoughts exactly :)
04:24 < rocknroll_:#liferay> took a lot of work getting all the details
04:41 < kravigupta:#liferay> :)
05:06 < kravigupta:#liferay> Guys.. When and why would you create an empty entity in service.xml?
05:16 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> hi there, I would like to add a nickname to users. So I created a custom-field in the user object in liferay control panel. Now I want to display this custom-field in the message board user display tag (replacing firstname and lastname display). Can I refer to <liferay-ui-custom-attribute/> when I'm already in <liferay-ui:user_display/> ?
05:17 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> I was thinking I could hook the start.jsp from html/taglib/ui/user_display and add a <liferay-ui:custom-attribute/> into the page.
05:21 < kravigupta:#liferay> I believe you can do that, did you try?
06:03 < urug_:#liferay> Content Administration - Browse by Structure works only for administrators, for others the filtered content (except for base Web Content Article) does not show up. There is a fixed jira issue, but fix is targeted for LF 7. I am looking for some workaround on LF 6.2 GA4. Either some fix by hook or by alternative solution for filtering content in a reasonable way

11:11 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> hi
11:11 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> is there a way to add a custom field to a message board category ?
11:51 <@jhf:#liferay> nicolas_FR: good question! and yes, you can
11:51 < Andrea___:#liferay> Hi all, a fast way to show a private page only to some roles?
11:51 <@jhf:#liferay> via control panel -> configuration -> custom fields
11:57 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> jhf: yes thanks found it. Btw I have a problem editing those custom field. I can set them when I create a new category, but not when I edit it
11:58 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> jhf: when editing a custom field for User by example, is easy. Just click modify > custom fields and you're done. Looks like there is no "custom fields" option when editing a message board category
12:00 <@jhf:#liferay> are you on 6.2 CE GA4?
12:00 <@jhf:#liferay> cause I just tried that, and it works
12:00 <@jhf:#liferay> I can edit the value of the custom field when editing the category
12:00 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> we're on 6.1.2 CE GA3
12:01 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> just migrated from 5.2.3
12:01 <@jhf:#liferay> oh yeah that was a bug in 6.1 https://issues.liferay.com/browse/LPS-18684
12:02 <@jhf:#liferay> it's fixed in 6.2
12:02 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> well we're not working on migrating to 6.2 for like 1 year from now
12:02 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> btw do you know if we can add a picture field (instead of text field) ?
12:06 <@jhf:#liferay> don't think picture fields are allowed as custom fields - I mean you might be able to fake it with a giant string or something
12:07 <@jhf:#liferay> you could probably fix the custom field issue for categories by using a JSP hook
12:10 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> jhf: for now I'll just copy/paste the full url of images from the liferay library. If I have time I'll try to fix the custom field issue for categories. Do you know how to get the description of a category in jsp ?
12:12 <@jhf:#liferay> if you know the categoryId you can just call MBCategoryLocalServiceUtil.getCategory(id).getDescription()
12:12 <@jhf:#liferay> you might want to escape it in case hackers put in javascript :)
12:13 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> thanks :)
12:19 <@jhf:#liferay> The category name: <span><%= htmlUtil.escape(MBCategoryLocalServiceUtil.getCategory(id).getDescription() %></span>
12:20 <@jhf:#liferay> htmlUtil is a utility that is made available in JSPs by default
