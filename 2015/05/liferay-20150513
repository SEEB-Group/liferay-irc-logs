10:24 < Andrea_:#liferay> HI all, anyone knows what is classPK attribute in the LR taglib ?
10:26 < Andrea_:#liferay> http://pastebin.com/MwGZCLQS this is working fine in MyAccount portlet but it does not show in User_admin portlet and i don't know why
10:33 < bijoo__:#liferay> Andrea_: classPK's entity's primary key
10:33 < Andrea_:#liferay> thanks, how can i retrieve that?
10:33 < bijoo__:#liferay> Andrea_: because probably selUser isn't exist?
10:33 < Andrea_:#liferay> yes it is called at the beginning of the jsp
10:34 < Andrea_:#liferay> User selUser = (User)request.getAttribute("user.selUser");
10:34 < bijoo__:#liferay> Andrea_: any errors associated too?
10:34 < Andrea_:#liferay> nope , console is clean
10:35 < bijoo__:#liferay> Andrea_: https://docs.liferay.com/portal/6.2/javadocs-all/com/liferay/portlet/asset/model/AssetEntry.html
10:35 < bijoo__:#liferay> Andrea_: it has getPrimaryKey method there
10:35 < bijoo__:#liferay> Andrea_: each entity has a primary key
10:35 < Andrea_:#liferay> and Luogo di Nascita is an expando entity right?
10:37 < bijoo__:#liferay> Andrea_: as for taglib, this is what is get called
10:37 < bijoo__:#liferay> Andrea_: https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/blob/6.2.2-ga3/portal-web/docroot/html/taglib/ui/custom_attribute/page.jsp
10:37 < bijoo__:#liferay> Andrea_: yes so it's the custom attribute name
10:37 < bijoo__:#liferay> Andrea_: I suggest you look that it should answer
10:37 < bijoo__:#liferay> Andrea_: you can run the same code in the console
10:37 < bijoo__:#liferay> Andrea_: http://www.liferay.com/web/sebastien.lemarchand/blog/-/blogs/5-tips-to-improve-usage-of-the-liferay-script-console
10:38 < bijoo__:#liferay> Andrea_: to test if the parameters make sense
10:38 < Andrea_:#liferay> nice, thank you. Do you aldready have a solution in mind or not?
10:39 < bijoo__:#liferay> Andrea_: I don't have the code as I'm tight on time
11:16 < josuebc:#liferay> Hi there. I am setting up a folder in Document Library so it will be viewed by every Site Member and just managed by useres in a specific Role. I am able to grant full access to the specific Role for this one folder but when they upload a document this document is not viewable by every Site Member.
11:16 < josuebc:#liferay> Any ideas how to do this?. also, when a user in the manager role for this folder upload a document, at the end of the form where it says "Viewable By", just Guest Role and Owner choices appear. This is within a private page so Guest Role doesn't work.
11:18 < bijoo_:#liferay> josuebc: so trying to set default permissions? When uploading document can set permission
11:18 < josuebc:#liferay> bijoo_: How can one set defalut permissions for uploaded documents?
11:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, ! \o/
11:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> the free marker wizard is in the house!
11:21 < josuebc:#liferay> bijoo_: Ok, never mind. I just fixed it. Let's call the manager role for the folder "Folder Manager". I have full access to the role Folder Manager in the folder "Folder" then I went to Roles and assigned permissons to "set permissions" to the Folder Manager in the role Site Membes.
11:21 <@jhf:#liferay> haha yeah been heads down the last week on the symposium mobile app
11:21 < josuebc:#liferay> Now when they add a file it will give them the option to be viewable by every site member.
11:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, bug? https://www.liferay.com/community/forums/-/message_boards/message/53744090
11:21 <@jhf:#liferay> one sec
11:21 <@jhf:#liferay> phone call
11:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> np
11:53 < Andrea_:#liferay> i didn't manage to resolve my issue, any tips?
12:17 <@jhf:#liferay> hey jardineworks
12:17 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf hey man
12:17 <@jhf:#liferay> hey so looking at your FM post
12:18 < jardineworks:#liferay> Andrea_, sorry boss, heads down trying to get a few things resolved today as I am probably having a baby this afternoon
12:18 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, np
12:19 < Andrea_:#liferay> wooo congrats man
12:19 < Andrea_:#liferay> enjoy this moment
12:19 <@jhf:#liferay> a random thought - <@liferay_portlet.actionURL var="myVar" plid="${plid}">
12:20 <@jhf:#liferay> I think that will end up converting the plid object to a string
12:20 <@jhf:#liferay> ${plid} tells freemarker to "render" the variable, i.e. toString
12:20 <@jhf:#liferay> I *think*
12:20 <@jhf:#liferay> since this is in a macro call I think there might be something special you have to do
12:21 <@jhf:#liferay> I think you're getting that exception because it's somehow passing a string instead of a long
12:24 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, I tried doing a getterUtil.. but no dice.
12:24 < jardineworks:#liferay> is there maybe a free marker built in function?
12:24 < jardineworks:#liferay> like ... plid?long or something?
12:24 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah something like that
