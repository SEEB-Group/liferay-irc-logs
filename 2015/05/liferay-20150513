10:24 < Andrea_:#liferay> HI all, anyone knows what is classPK attribute in the LR taglib ?
10:26 < Andrea_:#liferay> http://pastebin.com/MwGZCLQS this is working fine in MyAccount portlet but it does not show in User_admin portlet and i don't know why
10:33 < bijoo__:#liferay> Andrea_: classPK's entity's primary key
10:33 < Andrea_:#liferay> thanks, how can i retrieve that?
10:33 < bijoo__:#liferay> Andrea_: because probably selUser isn't exist?
10:33 < Andrea_:#liferay> yes it is called at the beginning of the jsp
10:34 < Andrea_:#liferay> User selUser = (User)request.getAttribute("user.selUser");
10:34 < bijoo__:#liferay> Andrea_: any errors associated too?
10:34 < Andrea_:#liferay> nope , console is clean
