05:56 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> hi there
05:58 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> I would like to customize if mails are sent or not from liferay. I know I can allow or deny mail sending from liferay, but I don't know how to pick which notification I would keep, and which I would throw away. Any idea ?
06:15 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> no ))
06:16 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> i wrote own portlet for custom contact form
06:17 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> but i can't understand how can i find one exception if server have bad-email-server-name....
09:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> [ru|de|en]CyberK, WHat you are doing sounds similar to an issue I am resovling right now. So you have a "vanity" url ... the one that the user uses. That url goes to a proxy and the proxy re-writes the hosname to a new (internal) value and send it to Liferay. Is that right?
09:28 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> y
09:29 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> found in tomcat-log that my LDAP doesn#t work now %)
09:32 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> i think, more problem is, that i need do always publishing in staging to see result...
09:35 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> hm... if i check LDAP-settings -> all checks are ok, but tomcat-log show me -> exception: problem accesing LDAP-server : invalid escape sequence [blablabla];remaining name "dc=server,dc=com"
09:41 < jardineworks:#liferay> [ru|de|en]CyberK, I'm not sure if our problem is exactly the same -- but I am doing something similar. The only difference is that I have multiple vanity urls that are all mapping to a single internal domain. For me, I am testing right now, but I have to create an EXT plugin that extended the PortalImpl class and extended the getPortalUrl(String,int,boolean) method so that he host that was returned by liferya is my VANITY host, not m
09:41 < jardineworks:#liferay> y internal host.
09:41 < jardineworks:#liferay> but I think this is more complicated for me because I have multiple domains ...
09:42 < jardineworks:#liferay> I did find though that there are references to the host in some of the JS files.
09:42 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> i need it too in next time
09:42 < jardineworks:#liferay> [ru|de|en]CyberK, well you'll be happy you found me. It's a nightmare :)
09:42 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> dont say this )))
09:43 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> 1 fix - 100000 bigs...
09:43 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> bugs*
09:43 < jardineworks:#liferay> I actually created a plugin for aliasing virtual hosts, a servlet filter hook to set a thread local that I can reference in my CustomPortalImpl class and the EXT plugin for the class itself.
09:43 < jardineworks:#liferay> I am testing so I am not sure that it works yet, but so far it looks promising.
09:44 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> hm...
09:44 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> it is more complicated :) why u do this?
09:45 < jardineworks:#liferay> Lieray only supports one hostname for a portal instance (Company) right? I need to support multiple, distinct hostnames.
09:45 < jardineworks:#liferay> so the proxy layer mapping to an internal one solves the inbound
09:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> but the problem is the outbound.
09:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> in order to make sure that all the internal.com urls are written to externaA.com or externalB.com .. consistently.. all links, pages, css, js, etc. ...  have to do it in the PortalImpl class.
09:49 < jardineworks:#liferay> [ru|de|en]CyberK, trust me... this is a last resort. We have tried 4 or 5 other things already... this is the only one that looks like it has a strong chance of success.
09:49 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> %)
09:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> [ru|de|en]CyberK, if it works I'll write a tutorial somewhere and share it with you
10:20 < g00se:#liferay> That's alarming. I thought Liferay supported virtual hosts...
10:36 < g00se:#liferay> jardineworks: Does it?
10:39 < winem_:#liferay> hi together. I have to make an offer for a customer with the CE vs EE edition of liferay. what's the benefit of the EE? fast vendor support and bug / security fixes?
10:42 < g00se:#liferay> winem_: What's the approximate cost of EE?
10:42 < winem_:#liferay> 25k â‚¬ per year
