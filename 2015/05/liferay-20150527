05:56 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> hi there
05:58 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> I would like to customize if mails are sent or not from liferay. I know I can allow or deny mail sending from liferay, but I don't know how to pick which notification I would keep, and which I would throw away. Any idea ?
06:15 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> no ))
06:16 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> i wrote own portlet for custom contact form
06:17 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> but i can't understand how can i find one exception if server have bad-email-server-name....
09:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> [ru|de|en]CyberK, WHat you are doing sounds similar to an issue I am resovling right now. So you have a "vanity" url ... the one that the user uses. That url goes to a proxy and the proxy re-writes the hosname to a new (internal) value and send it to Liferay. Is that right?
09:28 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> y
09:29 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> found in tomcat-log that my LDAP doesn#t work now %)
09:32 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> i think, more problem is, that i need do always publishing in staging to see result...
09:35 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> hm... if i check LDAP-settings -> all checks are ok, but tomcat-log show me -> exception: problem accesing LDAP-server : invalid escape sequence [blablabla];remaining name "dc=server,dc=com"
09:41 < jardineworks:#liferay> [ru|de|en]CyberK, I'm not sure if our problem is exactly the same -- but I am doing something similar. The only difference is that I have multiple vanity urls that are all mapping to a single internal domain. For me, I am testing right now, but I have to create an EXT plugin that extended the PortalImpl class and extended the getPortalUrl(String,int,boolean) method so that he host that was returned by liferya is my VANITY host, not m
09:41 < jardineworks:#liferay> y internal host.
09:41 < jardineworks:#liferay> but I think this is more complicated for me because I have multiple domains ...
