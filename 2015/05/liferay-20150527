05:56 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> hi there
05:58 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> I would like to customize if mails are sent or not from liferay. I know I can allow or deny mail sending from liferay, but I don't know how to pick which notification I would keep, and which I would throw away. Any idea ?
06:15 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> no ))
06:16 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> i wrote own portlet for custom contact form
06:17 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> but i can't understand how can i find one exception if server have bad-email-server-name....
09:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> [ru|de|en]CyberK, WHat you are doing sounds similar to an issue I am resovling right now. So you have a "vanity" url ... the one that the user uses. That url goes to a proxy and the proxy re-writes the hosname to a new (internal) value and send it to Liferay. Is that right?
09:28 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> y
09:29 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> found in tomcat-log that my LDAP doesn#t work now %)
09:32 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> i think, more problem is, that i need do always publishing in staging to see result...
09:35 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> hm... if i check LDAP-settings -> all checks are ok, but tomcat-log show me -> exception: problem accesing LDAP-server : invalid escape sequence [blablabla];remaining name "dc=server,dc=com"
09:41 < jardineworks:#liferay> [ru|de|en]CyberK, I'm not sure if our problem is exactly the same -- but I am doing something similar. The only difference is that I have multiple vanity urls that are all mapping to a single internal domain. For me, I am testing right now, but I have to create an EXT plugin that extended the PortalImpl class and extended the getPortalUrl(String,int,boolean) method so that he host that was returned by liferya is my VANITY host, not m
09:41 < jardineworks:#liferay> y internal host.
09:41 < jardineworks:#liferay> but I think this is more complicated for me because I have multiple domains ...
09:42 < jardineworks:#liferay> I did find though that there are references to the host in some of the JS files.
09:42 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> i need it too in next time
09:42 < jardineworks:#liferay> [ru|de|en]CyberK, well you'll be happy you found me. It's a nightmare :)
09:42 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> dont say this )))
09:43 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> 1 fix - 100000 bigs...
09:43 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> bugs*
09:43 < jardineworks:#liferay> I actually created a plugin for aliasing virtual hosts, a servlet filter hook to set a thread local that I can reference in my CustomPortalImpl class and the EXT plugin for the class itself.
09:43 < jardineworks:#liferay> I am testing so I am not sure that it works yet, but so far it looks promising.
09:44 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> hm...
09:44 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> it is more complicated :) why u do this?
09:45 < jardineworks:#liferay> Lieray only supports one hostname for a portal instance (Company) right? I need to support multiple, distinct hostnames.
09:45 < jardineworks:#liferay> so the proxy layer mapping to an internal one solves the inbound
09:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> but the problem is the outbound.
09:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> in order to make sure that all the internal.com urls are written to externaA.com or externalB.com .. consistently.. all links, pages, css, js, etc. ...  have to do it in the PortalImpl class.
09:49 < jardineworks:#liferay> [ru|de|en]CyberK, trust me... this is a last resort. We have tried 4 or 5 other things already... this is the only one that looks like it has a strong chance of success.
09:49 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> %)
09:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> [ru|de|en]CyberK, if it works I'll write a tutorial somewhere and share it with you
10:20 < g00se:#liferay> That's alarming. I thought Liferay supported virtual hosts...
10:36 < g00se:#liferay> jardineworks: Does it?
10:39 < winem_:#liferay> hi together. I have to make an offer for a customer with the CE vs EE edition of liferay. what's the benefit of the EE? fast vendor support and bug / security fixes?
10:42 < g00se:#liferay> winem_: What's the approximate cost of EE?
10:42 < winem_:#liferay> 25k â‚¬ per year
10:43 < winem_:#liferay> we're just talking about a couple of websites with log ins for personal profile pages... no transactions or anything else. so I don't think that the customer needs the EE but we want to offer both opportunities
10:58 < jardineworks:#liferay> g00se, it depends on how you are referring to it
10:58 < jardineworks:#liferay> g00se, my business problem I believe is unique to the province of quebec really.
10:59 < jardineworks:#liferay> they want to have a url for the english site, and a url for the french site... but one portal instance where all content etc reside (whcih makes sense for users, etc)
10:59 < jardineworks:#liferay> A company, or portal instance, only has support for a single hostname
10:59 < jardineworks:#liferay> and there is a constraint on the Virtaul Host table where the companyId has to be unique
11:00 < jardineworks:#liferay> winem_, updates and security fixes are the two primary
11:00 < winem_:#liferay> ok, thanks jardineworks :)
11:00 < jardineworks:#liferay> winem_, you also get support for problems you come across, and, potentially fixes.
11:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> if you can convince Liferay support you found a bug
11:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> I have found several and have yet to have received a single patch.
11:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> winem_, it is also faster.
11:01 < winem_:#liferay> didn't you receive any patch or do you just receive them with a big delay?
11:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> the 6.2 CE is the equivalent (I was told once) of 6.1 EE.
11:02 < jardineworks:#liferay> we have a show stopper issue for us that we have been waiting for a solution on for almost 2 months. I'm pretty annoyed.
11:02 < jardineworks:#liferay> we have a work around, but personally, it's BS.
11:02 < jardineworks:#liferay> and my client have about 14 licenses.
11:02 < jardineworks:#liferay> sooooooooooooo... I'm a little surprised to be honest.
11:03 < winem_:#liferay> what does BS mean?
11:04 < winem_:#liferay> I guess you don't mean bullshit
11:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> i do
11:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> i'm annoyed
11:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> :)
11:04 < winem_:#liferay> hehe, ok
11:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> there are other things you get with EE too
11:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> ... like EE plugins
11:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> some of them like the caching and clustering plugins improve performance as well
11:04 < winem_:#liferay> but there's one interesting point. EE is faster than the CE?
11:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> it is
11:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> I find it most noticeable at startup
11:05 < winem_:#liferay> and at recerving requests?
11:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> I think the EE runs a little quicker, but again, there are tweaks to it and EE plugins that are probably influencing
11:05 < winem_:#liferay> serving requests... I'm not very concentrated, sorry :D
11:06 < jardineworks:#liferay> and I haven't done any tuning to my CE instance.
11:06 < jardineworks:#liferay> I mean, really, it would only matter I think in a high volume scenario
11:07 < jardineworks:#liferay> there is also the soft side of things. Your shop selling EE licenses puts you on track to becoming a Liferay partner :)
11:09 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> :)
11:09 < winem_:#liferay> we already have a liferay partner on our side and we don't want to resell any license. we just provide the hosting of the website itself.
11:09 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> is liferay partner - good ?
11:10 < winem_:#liferay> ask modd_ :)
11:11 < modd_:#liferay> what!?
11:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> [ru|de|en]CyberK, I'd think so. I mean, commission on license sales? lead generation? exposure at their events/on their site...
11:13 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> hm... we just make own web-site now .... hehe... so hard )
11:13 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> CE is so buggy )
11:16 < winem_:#liferay> modd_ regarding "<[ru|de|en]CyberK> is liferay partner - good ?" ;)
11:23 < modd_:#liferay> beein a liferay partner or liferay as partner or a certain partner of liferay?
11:26 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> i don't think that my boss will be partner of liferay now...
11:26 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> is it true, that next LR GA5 will be published in next 6 month?
11:27 < jardineworks:#liferay> [ru|de|en]CyberK, you'd need to ask Liferay... but they don't often commit to dates :)
11:27 < g00se:#liferay> I suppose there's the option of paid external support with CE too ...
11:32 < jardineworks:#liferay> g00se, I don't think so
11:32 < jardineworks:#liferay> g00se, not with Liferay anyway... you could probably buy that through someone who offers Liferay services though
11:38 < g00se:#liferay> Someone like ... you? ;)
11:39 < g00se:#liferay> Maybe you work for Liferay - i'm not sure yet :)
11:41 < g00se:#liferay> (I didn't mean to sound flippant btw)
11:41 < jardineworks:#liferay> haha
11:41 < jardineworks:#liferay> I don't work for Liferay, though i could be considered an unofficial evangelist.
11:42 < jardineworks:#liferay> and yes, I do have my own practice where I offer Liferay services.
11:42 < jardineworks:#liferay> but no, that was not a sales pitch :)
11:43 < jardineworks:#liferay> Liferay has its bugs .. sure... but show me any application even remotely close to its size that doesn't. At least with an open source platform, you can fix the problems yourself.
11:43 < jardineworks:#liferay> good luck doing that with SharePoint.. or Oracle Portal.. etc.
11:43 < g00se:#liferay> Quite
11:44 < jardineworks:#liferay> And honestly, I still maintain that when you know what you are doing with Liferay ... it's an incredibly powerful tool for building things quickly.
11:44 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> it's true...
11:44 < jardineworks:#liferay> it has a learning curve sure.. but at least it follows a pattern consistently. Once you understand Liferay's pattern the whole thing becomes unlocked.
11:44 < jardineworks:#liferay> but bugs will always piss off developers :)
11:44 < jardineworks:#liferay> just like QA people ;)
11:45 < g00se:#liferay> On another matter, i can't say my searches have been exhaustive but i've not found a plugin (what IS the proper Lray term btw?) that can take Paypal donations. IS there one you know of?
11:48 < jardineworks:#liferay> g00se, if it's not in the market place... and you can;t find someone's github repo with it... then you probably have to build it yourself.
11:49 < jardineworks:#liferay> (plugin is the correct term... a portlet plugin in your case I suspect)
11:50 < g00se:#liferay> There was something called 'btop' that won a prize. Not supported on 6.2 though
11:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> is there a repo you can clone to port it to 6.2?
11:52 < g00se:#liferay> Yes. I've looked at it, but it's probably too much for a newb like me, even though i am seasoned in Java and certified ;)
11:53 < jardineworks:#liferay> sink or swim g00se ;)
11:53 < jardineworks:#liferay> whats the repo?
11:54 < g00se:#liferay> https://github.com/cehjohnson/btop
11:56 < g00se:#liferay> To backtrack a bit, did you get my q about Liferay supporting virtual hosts? If so i probably missed your comment owing to network changeovers
