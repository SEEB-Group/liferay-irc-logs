04:10 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> hi there, I would like to add a random.html file in my webapps folder which would be accessible directly by url : [liferay site]/random.html. How can I do that ? Putting the file in webapps doesn't work

05:52 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> hi all
07:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> nicolas_FR, I don't think you can do that because of the way Liferay processes requests. What you can do though is create a portal level (unprotected) struts action hook and have it return that file.
07:22 < jardineworks:#liferay> you basically just create the struts action hook, and in the render method have it return the html file. THe html file should be part of the hook as well ... as a "custom jsp" so that you can include the file in the ROOT context.
07:22 < jardineworks:#liferay> nicolas_FR, You're on 6.1 right?
07:22 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> any tipp, why aui.css and custom.css can be blocked with firewall??
08:16 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> jardineworks: hi, and thanks for the informations. I found some tricks on internet, upload the html page in document and media (L6.1), create a page (type URL) and link the document to the url. Working
08:17 < jardineworks:#liferay> neat! I didn't know you could do that :)
08:26 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> i think this is bad idee ))
08:35 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> Failed to load resource: net::ERR_CONNECTION_TIMED_OUT  for aui.css and custom.css in my theme....
08:35 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> wrong redirect
08:46 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> only this two css-files will be wront written in custom virtualhost-name
08:49 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> aui.css will be included over $theme.include($top_head_include), and custom.css over #css ("$css_folder/custom .css")
09:25 < winem_:#liferay> hi together
09:26 < winem_:#liferay> what would you recommend to gather website stats. is there any cool feature from liferay or would you recommend something like piwik?
09:27 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> u don't like piwik or gAnalytics?
09:28 < winem_:#liferay> I did not use it for years but it was ok. just want to know what you recommend
09:28 < winem_:#liferay> there might be something that is more up-to-date or simply better than piwik :)
09:28 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> piwik better, if u have own php-hosting
09:29 < winem_:#liferay> nope, no php. only liferay and JEE applications
09:29 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> so, only Google or any external-services
09:29 < winem_:#liferay> ok
10:30 < hufg:#liferay> yoyo i need a liferay guru!
10:31 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> me too )
10:31 < hufg:#liferay> any ideas how to add something to web content friendly url ie. configure asset publisher as page default asset publisher, add display page to web content
10:32 < hufg:#liferay> then the simplest url to web content is domain.com/-/web-content-title
10:32 < hufg:#liferay> which will then be shown in the asset publisher on the display page
10:32 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> right
10:32 < hufg:#liferay> how about domain.com/something/-/web-content-title
10:32 < hufg:#liferay> haven't found the redirection logic
10:33 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> aren't
10:33 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> u can try edit url-rewrite logic
10:33 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> but couldn't fine any tutorials for this...
10:34 < hufg:#liferay> yeha but haven't found it
10:34 < hufg:#liferay> there is a mention about url-rewrite.xml
10:34 < hufg:#liferay> urlrewrite.xml
10:34 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> i have for AP extra page "news" and show content on this page... so i have url like ***/news/-/title
10:34 < hufg:#liferay> uhh but don't you have AP instance stuff in the url also
10:35 < hufg:#liferay> yeah it should be like domain.com/news/-/title
