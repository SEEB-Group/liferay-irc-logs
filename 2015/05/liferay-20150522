05:52 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> hi all
07:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> nicolas_FR, I don't think you can do that because of the way Liferay processes requests. What you can do though is create a portal level (unprotected) struts action hook and have it return that file.
07:22 < jardineworks:#liferay> you basically just create the struts action hook, and in the render method have it return the html file. THe html file should be part of the hook as well ... as a "custom jsp" so that you can include the file in the ROOT context.
07:22 < jardineworks:#liferay> nicolas_FR, You're on 6.1 right?
07:22 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> any tipp, why aui.css and custom.css can be blocked with firewall??
08:16 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> jardineworks: hi, and thanks for the informations. I found some tricks on internet, upload the html page in document and media (L6.1), create a page (type URL) and link the document to the url. Working
08:17 < jardineworks:#liferay> neat! I didn't know you could do that :)
08:26 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> i think this is bad idee ))
08:35 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> Failed to load resource: net::ERR_CONNECTION_TIMED_OUT  for aui.css and custom.css in my theme....
08:35 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> wrong redirect
08:46 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> only this two css-files will be wront written in custom virtualhost-name
08:49 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> aui.css will be included over $theme.include($top_head_include), and custom.css over #css ("$css_folder/custom .css")
09:25 < winem_:#liferay> hi together
09:26 < winem_:#liferay> what would you recommend to gather website stats. is there any cool feature from liferay or would you recommend something like piwik?
09:27 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> u don't like piwik or gAnalytics?
09:28 < winem_:#liferay> I did not use it for years but it was ok. just want to know what you recommend
09:28 < winem_:#liferay> there might be something that is more up-to-date or simply better than piwik :)
09:28 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> piwik better, if u have own php-hosting
09:29 < winem_:#liferay> nope, no php. only liferay and JEE applications
09:29 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> so, only Google or any external-services
09:29 < winem_:#liferay> ok
10:30 < hufg:#liferay> yoyo i need a liferay guru!
10:31 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> me too )
10:31 < hufg:#liferay> any ideas how to add something to web content friendly url ie. configure asset publisher as page default asset publisher, add display page to web content
10:32 < hufg:#liferay> then the simplest url to web content is domain.com/-/web-content-title
10:32 < hufg:#liferay> which will then be shown in the asset publisher on the display page
10:32 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> right
10:32 < hufg:#liferay> how about domain.com/something/-/web-content-title
10:32 < hufg:#liferay> haven't found the redirection logic
10:33 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> aren't
10:33 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> u can try edit url-rewrite logic
10:33 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> but couldn't fine any tutorials for this...
10:34 < hufg:#liferay> yeha but haven't found it
10:34 < hufg:#liferay> there is a mention about url-rewrite.xml
10:34 < hufg:#liferay> urlrewrite.xml
10:34 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> i have for AP extra page "news" and show content on this page... so i have url like ***/news/-/title
10:34 < hufg:#liferay> uhh but don't you have AP instance stuff in the url also
10:35 < hufg:#liferay> yeah it should be like domain.com/news/-/title
10:35 < hufg:#liferay> but domain.com/-/title is the best i can do, otherwise it's domain.com/news/-/asset-publisher/instance-id/title
10:35 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> xD
10:35 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> LR6.2GA4?
10:36 < hufg:#liferay> yeah basicly 6.2 latest ee
10:36 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> hm..
10:46 < hufg:#liferay> but uhuh do you have clean urls to AP web content on some page?
10:48 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> nope
10:49 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> after GA4-bugg with AP and own templates we removed this. and created other solution..
10:50 < hufg:#liferay> ok
10:51 < hufg:#liferay> in theory maybe modify urlrewrite.xml in a way that the url does not change
10:51 < hufg:#liferay> or in the front server
10:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> hufg, what's the question?
10:51 < hufg:#liferay> [17:31] <hufg> any ideas how to add something to web content friendly url ie. configure asset publisher as page default asset publisher, add display page to web content [17:32] <hufg> then the simplest url to web content is domain.com/-/web-content-title [17:32] <hufg> which will then be shown in the asset publisher on the display page [17:32] <[ru|de|en]CyberK> right [17:32] <hufg> how about domain.com/something/-/web-content-title
10:53 < jardineworks:#liferay> hufg, ah.. shoot, I thought maybe you were working on the same issue as me -- trying to get localize canonical urls so that the language actually changes.
10:53 < hufg:#liferay> hmm?
10:54 < jardineworks:#liferay> hufg, for example, I have a web content item in 3 languages. THe content will change as a toggle between languages, but the url will always show english
10:54 < hufg:#liferay> uh so you want different friendly urls for different lang
10:54 < jardineworks:#liferay> hufg, bingo
10:55 < jardineworks:#liferay> hufg, an English URL to french content is pretty stupid.
10:55 < hufg:#liferay> easiest to have different sites for different lang
10:55 < jardineworks:#liferay> hufg, gross... then I have to create all my content in two different sites?
10:55 < hufg:#liferay> yep
10:55 < jardineworks:#liferay> *barf*
10:55 < hufg:#liferay> but but if you do not have identical content
10:55 < hufg:#liferay> it works for your advantage hehe
10:56 < jardineworks:#liferay> if I can provide localized content instances, then it should be smart enough to use whatever title matches the language.
10:56 < hufg:#liferay> are you aware that there is no possibility to have different structure/content within a site
10:56 < hufg:#liferay> having a single site for multiple languages == same content and some structure in all languages
10:57 < hufg:#liferay> thus two sites will be a blessing if that is not the case
10:58 < jardineworks:#liferay> hufg, sorry? I'm not sure I understand what you just said
10:59 < hufg:#liferay> sometimes when people want a site in different languages they also want different content for different language versions
10:59 < hufg:#liferay> the page content/page structure will be different
11:00 < hufg:#liferay> maybe they don't want to translate everything
11:00 < hufg:#liferay> this is impossible with one site
11:00 < hufg:#liferay> if web content has not been translated it will be shown in default language, you will get mixed language pages
11:01 < hufg:#liferay> if everything will not be translated
11:01 < hufg:#liferay> so in essence two languages in a single site --> same page structure, 100% same content everything translated
11:02 < hufg:#liferay> then comes the client and tells you no we don't want that page in french, oh no we don't want to translate everything like 90%
11:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> hufg, Oh I understand... this is not the case for me though. Everything is translated for my client. EVERYTHING. I am even working on a EXT plugin to provide distinct VirtualHost urls.
11:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> for the same instance that is
11:04 < hufg:#liferay> hehe
11:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> it's .... challenging.
11:05 < hufg:#liferay> just did a hide content if no translations and asset publisher custom localization stuff
11:05 < hufg:#liferay> it was suck eheh
11:05 < hufg:#liferay> the result is mediocre at best
11:05 < hufg:#liferay> if this wasn't logged i'd say shitty at best
11:06 < hufg:#liferay> 8)
11:07 < hufg:#liferay> jardineworks: shouldn't it be somewhat straightforward
11:07 < hufg:#liferay> VirtualHostFilter
11:08 < hufg:#liferay> map your virtualhosts to correct groupid
11:08 < hufg:#liferay> done?
11:08 < hufg:#liferay> ah the groupid is same
11:08 < hufg:#liferay> woops wrong use case
11:14 < jardineworks:#liferay> hufg, The real problem is in the PortalImpl ... getPortalURL( String serverName, String port, boolean)
11:15 < jardineworks:#liferay> this is where all the URLs stem from
11:15 < jardineworks:#liferay> so in there I added a "VirtualHostAlias" feature that allows you to create aliases, based on locale, for a VirtualHost.
11:15 < jardineworks:#liferay> and then if an alias is found, the serverName is updated to the alias.
11:15 < jardineworks:#liferay> It's mostly working.. stuck on one thing that I am trying to figure out.

13:01 -!- mode/#liferay [+o jhf] by ChanServ
13:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, I thought that after the initial deploy of an EXT plugin (which requires a restart) subsequent deploys were hot? Do you know if that is that case?
13:10 <@jhf:#liferay> No I dont' think you can ever hot-deploy an EXT
13:10 <@jhf:#liferay> I mean it replaces/extends classes in WEB-INF/lib
13:11 <@jhf:#liferay> which are already loaded by the time of hot deploys
13:19 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, shoot -- so you have to do a "clean" of the server everytime you make a change?
14:19 < modd:#liferay> anyone tested the LR 7 M5 build?
14:21 < modd:#liferay> I had some issues with the frontend (js errors and not working dropdowns etc.) :\
