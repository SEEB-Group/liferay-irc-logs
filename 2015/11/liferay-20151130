10:54 < jardinworks:#liferay> Andreaaaaaa: that tag allow you to embed portlets in a view.
10:55 < Andreaaaaaa:#liferay> hey jardine ! how are you? thanks as always :) where can i find more deatiled info about it?
10:55 < jardinworks:#liferay> Andreaaaaaa: if you have the portal source, then you can find the java class for the tag by looking up the class name RuntimeTag (I think... the tags usually end in *Tag)
10:55 < Andreaaaaaa:#liferay> thanks!
10:55 < jardinworks:#liferay> but the java class is usually pretty useless.
10:55 < jardinworks:#liferay> :)
10:55 < jardinworks:#liferay> better to find jsps
10:55 < jardinworks:#liferay> and look at the "page.jsp" for the tag
10:55 < jardinworks:#liferay> in there you will likely find the embedding logic
10:56 < jardinworks:#liferay> .. its done in the JSP (which many would call bad practice) I beleive so that you can HOOK it to change the logic if you need to.
10:56 < Andreaaaaaa:#liferay> and where can i find this jsp?
10:58 < Andreaaaaaa:#liferay> ok, just found it, it should be https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/blob/6.2.x/portal-web/docroot/html/taglib/portlet/preview/page.jsp this right?
11:08 < jardinworks:#liferay> hmm
11:08 < jardinworks:#liferay> not sure if it would be preview.. lemme check
11:10 < jardinworks:#liferay> hmm... maybe RuntimeTag has the logic in it.. usually the tags are pretty bare but this one looks meatier.
11:13 < jardinworks:#liferay> Andreaaaaaa: did you find the RumetimeTag class?
11:14 < Andreaaaaaa:#liferay> i am downloading sourcecode of 6.2 right now!
11:21 < Andreaaaaaa:#liferay> found it! now i have to study this O.O
11:22 < Andreaaaaaa:#liferay> thanks jardine
11:33 < jardinworks:#liferay> np
11:54 < Andreaaaaaa:#liferay> jardine, srry if i´m bothering you..but when you say ¨allow you to embed portlets in a view¨..by view you mean a portlet view or a generic view>
11:54 < Andreaaaaaa:#liferay> ?*
11:57 < jardinworks:#liferay> Andreaaaaaa: most of the time I think people use that tag in a template (as in Theme template, or ADT etc) to embed a portlet in a view. But you can totally use it in a regular portlet view as far as I know.
11:57 < jardinworks:#liferay> In fact, I have never investigated, but I suspect the nested portlets portlet works using that tag :)
11:59 < Andreaaaaaa:#liferay> ok thanks!
12:32 < sol_:#liferay> in the catalina.out logfile there are different types of dates for events:
12:32 < sol_:#liferay> 16:15:24,665 INFO [localhost-startStop-1][AutoDeployDir:139] Auto deploy scanner started for /opt/tomcat/liferay-portal/deploy
12:32 < sol_:#liferay> Nov 30, 2015 4:15:28 PM org.apache.catalina.startup.HostConfig deployWAR
12:33 < sol_:#liferay> why are the dates different and how and where do i change settings so that both are the same?
12:35 < sol_:#liferay> same format
13:06 < jardinworks:#liferay> sol_: check the TOMCAT_HOME/bin/setenv.sh/bat (depending on your environment) .. by default the timezone for the bundle (assuming you are using tomcat of course) is GMT. You probably want to change it to your timezone.
13:07 < sol_:#liferay> hmm
13:08 < jardinworks:#liferay> GMT or UTC... I can never remmeber.
13:08 < sol_:#liferay> well the timezone should be okay
13:08 < sol_:#liferay> problem is that one time i get no date in the time
13:08 < jardinworks:#liferay> at any rate, I know for me (I am in EST) all my logging is off by 5 hours (we're GMT-5) until I change that.
13:08 < sol_:#liferay> 16:15:24,665 INFO <-- just the hour.. but not the day
13:09 < jardinworks:#liferay> oh I see
13:09 < sol_:#liferay> yeah =)
13:10 < jardinworks:#liferay> that should just be the logging format ...  in Liferay if you want to override the logging settings (acros restarts) you can create a file called portal-ext-log4j or soemthing.. one second, lemme look it up
13:12 < jardinworks:#liferay> sol_: portal-log4j-ext.xml
13:12 < sol_:#liferay> so you say the tomcat logging gives the date but not the liferay-logging
13:12 < jardinworks:#liferay> drop that into ROOT/WEB-INF/classes/META-INF with the pattern you want
13:13 < sol_:#liferay> okay
13:13 < sol_:#liferay> now i just need to find out how the pattern is and how the entry for the pattern is named
13:13 < jardinworks:#liferay> sol_: I don't have the patterns memorized... this is the one that LR uses by default -- log4j.appender.CONSOLE.layout.ConversionPattern=%d{ABSOLUTE} %-5p [%c{1}:%L] %m%n
13:14 < sol_:#liferay> thx
13:14 < jardinworks:#liferay> tomcat by default I think uses the JULI logger -- not log4j
13:15 < jardinworks:#liferay> though I have no idea how you tell which line comes from which :)
13:15 < sol_:#liferay> argh =)
13:15 < jardinworks:#liferay> bu tI would presume anything that comes from a thread spawned by LR would be the Log4j stuff
13:15 < sol_:#liferay> okay
13:17 < jardinworks:#liferay> sol_: https://www.liferay.com/community/wiki/-/wiki/Main/How+to+configure+the+logs+in+Liferay
13:19 < sol_:#liferay> jardinworks: yes thx i saw it allready
13:21 < dtordable:#liferay> hello
13:56 < jardinworks:#liferay> dtordable: hi
13:57 < dtordable:#liferay> anyone around here?
14:01 < jardinworks:#liferay> I am
14:01 < jardinworks:#liferay> :)
14:04 < dtordable:#liferay> ok
14:05 < dtordable:#liferay> have dowloaded liferay version BSD
14:05 < dtordable:#liferay> and yeah
14:05 < dtordable:#liferay> I knew have to devel a bit
14:06 < dtordable:#liferay> what do I VCS then?
14:07 < dtordable:#liferay> in order to follow the upgrades is like overwritting the source code
14:08 < dtordable:#liferay> and commit changes to the new version
14:08 < dtordable:#liferay> my addons are simple
14:09 < dtordable:#liferay> so jardinworks, what to do?
14:10 < dtordable:#liferay> only vcs the addons?
15:44 < dtordable:#liferay> jardinworks: have you read me?
15:58 < jardinworks:#liferay> dtordable: I read what you wrote but I don't really understand what you are trying to say
16:08 < dtordable:#liferay> so what it really is on the VCS are what I code outside Liferay?
16:10 < jardinworks:#liferay> dtordable: when you say VCS, are you referring to the "Version Control System" ... as in Github?
16:15 < dtordable:#liferay> yeah
16:18 < jardinworks:#liferay> dtordable: your best bet if you want to intall liferay is to download one of the bundles rather than building from source.
16:19 < jardinworks:#liferay> once you have it installed you need to decide if you are going to use maven or ANT to build your plugins
16:20 < jardinworks:#liferay> there are multiple plugins and they all have a slightly different approach to what happens to the runtime. In some cases you simply "add" things to the portal (like custom portlets) in other cases you inject logic (some types of hooks) and there are also cases where you overwrite the base portal logic completely (jsp hooks and EXT plugins)
16:20 < jardinworks:#liferay> most people who start with Liferay will do so with the Liferay Studio (Eclipse + Liferay Plugins) to give you visuals to help with project manangement etc.
16:23 < dtordable:#liferay> wait, was smoking a cig, jardinworks :)
16:25 < dtordable:#liferay> as I do blindly
16:25 < dtordable:#liferay> created a site with this system
16:26 < dtordable:#liferay> but I'm stuck now
16:26 < dtordable:#liferay> done a subsite called Blog
16:27 < dtordable:#liferay> and AFAIK every section has to have a subsite
16:28 < jardinworks:#liferay> dtordable: you've lost me again. Let's start over and let's play 20 questions.
16:28 < dtordable:#liferay> but all the blogs have to appear in frontpage
16:28 < jardinworks:#liferay> Q1. You have cloned the master branch of Liferays github? Yess/No
16:28 < dtordable:#liferay> but individual blogs have to be in /blog/...
16:31 < dtordable:#liferay> no, no, jardinworks installed a tomcat bundle
16:31 < jardinworks:#liferay> Q2. 6.2 GA4?
16:31 < dtordable:#liferay> jardinworks: yes
16:31 < jardinworks:#liferay> Q3. Have you configured a database? or are you using the out of of the box HSQL?
16:32 < dtordable:#liferay> jardinworks: pgsql indeed :)
16:32 < jardinworks:#liferay> excellent.
16:32 < jardinworks:#liferay> ok -- so archtiecture wise...
16:33 < jardinworks:#liferay> Liferay is a multi-tenant application. Think of it kinda like VMs... you can run multiple "Portal Instances" with one physicaly installation of Liferay
16:33 < jardinworks:#liferay> when you install the portal you get a "default instance" normally called Liferay.com
16:33 < jardinworks:#liferay> Within a portal instance you can create multiple sites.
16:33 < dtordable:#liferay> yeah
16:33 < jardinworks:#liferay> So you can kinda of think of a portal instance like a "company"
16:33 < jardinworks:#liferay> and then a company might have n sites.
16:34 < jardinworks:#liferay> within a site you create "pages" (which are referred to as "layouts" in the API/Database)
16:34 < dtordable:#liferay> configured the instance
16:34 < dtordable:#liferay> its not liferay
16:34 < jardinworks:#liferay> a layout can be generic, or it can use a template -- for example, you can create a "blog page" which is basically a page that is using the "blog template"
16:35 < dtordable:#liferay> aha
16:36 < dtordable:#liferay> so I dont need subsites then, am I?
16:37 < jardinworks:#liferay> depends on what you are trying to do I guess... but if you just need to make "a site that has a blog" - you should not need sub sites
16:37 < dtordable:#liferay> every section is a page?
16:37 < jardinworks:#liferay> just probably a page with the blog roll -- in which case I think you would want to use the "Asset Publisher Portlet" and configure it to show content of type Blog,
16:38 < dtordable:#liferay> it is really a multiblog
16:38 < dtordable:#liferay> diferent blogs on the site
16:39 < jardinworks:#liferay> dtordable: so then I think the answer is "it depends" :) ... I mean, you COULD have a page for each "type of blog" or you could have "a site per blog". If you think a blog is going to expand to be more than one page, then perhaps better to have it as a site.
16:39 < dtordable:#liferay> well
16:40 < dtordable:#liferay> this seem weird hahaha
16:41 < jardinworks:#liferay> dtordable: put it this way.. lets say I have a news company called ABC News. That would be a portal instance. Then I could do "a site for sports blog, and a site for a tech blog." ... or I can do a blog section of the site and then filter by categories when someone wants to just see one type of blog post.
16:41 < jardinworks:#liferay> I mean, the thing is the portal offers really rich permissioning... so things like workflow, permissions for contributors, permissions for end users etc are a big component of the design
16:42 < dtordable:#liferay> as I saw the Blog ctype is inside it
16:42 < jardinworks:#liferay> the simplest though? one site per blog I would say
16:42 < dtordable:#liferay> so
16:42 < jardinworks:#liferay> you just might end up duplicating some effort around permissions and stuff...
16:43 < jardinworks:#liferay> but it will be easier to understand the structure.
16:43 < dtordable:#liferay> Main site > blog site > my blog | her blog | his blog?
16:44 < dtordable:#liferay> thats the structure
16:46 < dtordable:#liferay> and for beggining also a private page that i'll bring public in future
16:47 < dtordable:#liferay> and the rest of sections Ill do when I understand the whole, jardinworks
16:50 < dtordable:#liferay> jardinworks: this is weird hahaha
16:51 < dtordable:#liferay> (if its weird Im interested :))
16:51 < jardinworks:#liferay> are my blog, his blog, her blog just individual pages? meaning one page blogs? where the main page is just a list of blog posts that you click through to the detail?
16:52 < dtordable:#liferay> yeah
16:54 < dtordable:#liferay> so every blog is a page or a subsite of the blogs subsite?
16:54 < dtordable:#liferay> all blogs appear in the /
16:55 < jardinworks:#liferay> hmmm
16:55 < dtordable:#liferay> so ill create a page
16:55 < jardinworks:#liferay> so ... lets say the url is abcnews.com/blogs/<blogname>
16:55 < dtordable:#liferay> wit
16:55 < dtordable:#liferay> YEAH
16:55 < jardinworks:#liferay> in that case, it'd be easiest to have each blog as a page...
