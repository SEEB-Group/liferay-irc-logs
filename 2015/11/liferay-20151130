10:54 < jardinworks:#liferay> Andreaaaaaa: that tag allow you to embed portlets in a view.
10:55 < Andreaaaaaa:#liferay> hey jardine ! how are you? thanks as always :) where can i find more deatiled info about it?
10:55 < jardinworks:#liferay> Andreaaaaaa: if you have the portal source, then you can find the java class for the tag by looking up the class name RuntimeTag (I think... the tags usually end in *Tag)
10:55 < Andreaaaaaa:#liferay> thanks!
10:55 < jardinworks:#liferay> but the java class is usually pretty useless.
10:55 < jardinworks:#liferay> :)
10:55 < jardinworks:#liferay> better to find jsps
10:55 < jardinworks:#liferay> and look at the "page.jsp" for the tag
10:55 < jardinworks:#liferay> in there you will likely find the embedding logic
10:56 < jardinworks:#liferay> .. its done in the JSP (which many would call bad practice) I beleive so that you can HOOK it to change the logic if you need to.
10:56 < Andreaaaaaa:#liferay> and where can i find this jsp?
10:58 < Andreaaaaaa:#liferay> ok, just found it, it should be https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/blob/6.2.x/portal-web/docroot/html/taglib/portlet/preview/page.jsp this right?
11:08 < jardinworks:#liferay> hmm
11:08 < jardinworks:#liferay> not sure if it would be preview.. lemme check
11:10 < jardinworks:#liferay> hmm... maybe RuntimeTag has the logic in it.. usually the tags are pretty bare but this one looks meatier.
11:13 < jardinworks:#liferay> Andreaaaaaa: did you find the RumetimeTag class?
11:14 < Andreaaaaaa:#liferay> i am downloading sourcecode of 6.2 right now!
11:21 < Andreaaaaaa:#liferay> found it! now i have to study this O.O
