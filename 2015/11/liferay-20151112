02:24 < game0:#liferay> guys, I'm reading a book called liferay for beginner I bought it from packtpub but the problem is that. and I'm following the tutorial and practicing on liferay 6.2 GA4 version
02:24 < game0:#liferay> but my problem is two things
02:25 < game0:#liferay> In the control panel while I'm following the tutorial it asked me to create commmunity which isn't shown in this version I see only organization
02:25 < game0:#liferay> the second thing while I'm creating a group I cannot assign it to the organization why?
