05:23 < iflow885:#liferay> hi
05:25 < iflow885:#liferay> please, can somebody explain to me, how i can include breadcrumb navigation into my structure template?
06:19 < modd_:#liferay> iflow885: AFAIR it's just a #breadcrumbs()
06:44 < iflow885:#liferay> modd_, i have tried #breadcrumbs() but it does not work
06:45 < iflow885:#liferay> if i put #breadcrumbs in my theme template (portal_normal.vm) it works well
07:05 < modd_:#liferay> ah, I misunderstood it I guess
07:05 < modd_:#liferay> hmm
