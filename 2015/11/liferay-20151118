06:36 < hufg:#liferay> hello!
06:37 < hufg:#liferay> anyone used custom folder permissions in document library for some role?
06:37 < hufg:#liferay> like restrict access only for this folder
10:11 < jardineworks_:#liferay> landkommunenhipp: Maybe I can help :)
10:11 < jardineworks_:#liferay> oh wait
10:12 < jardineworks_:#liferay> just saw that you found a solution lol.
10:12 < jardineworks_:#liferay> nevermind :)
10:13 < landkommunenhipp:#liferay> thank you anyway.
10:14 < landkommunenhipp:#liferay> What was your solution?
10:14 < landkommunenhipp:#liferay> I modified the portal.xml file inside portal-impl.jar.
10:14 < landkommunenhipp:#liferay> This is maybe not the best way, since you can not ratrace it well.
10:32 < jardineworks_:#liferay> hufg: ack!
10:32 < jardineworks_:#liferay> landkommunenhipp: I don't think you should to that boss.
10:33 < landkommunenhipp:#liferay> What is the solution then?
10:33 < jardineworks_:#liferay> landkommunenhipp: to make sure I understand... you want to allow users who are not logged in to search for other users and organizations?
10:35 < landkommunenhipp:#liferay> jip
10:35 < landkommunenhipp:#liferay> That is exactly what I want to do.
10:35 < landkommunenhipp:#liferay> For some Background Information: This is some kind of legacy Application. Organizations are used as representations for companies which Users can vote for.
10:35 < landkommunenhipp:#liferay> Unauthenticated Users shall see them anyway to get some basic information about the companies as well.
10:36 < jardineworks_:#liferay> landkommunenhipp: ok -- give me a few minutes to check a few things.
10:36 < jardineworks_:#liferay> landkommunenhipp: you are using the "search" portlet right?
10:36 < jardineworks_:#liferay> and which version of LR are you on? 6.2?
10:37 < landkommunenhipp:#liferay> Yes I use the search Portlet.
10:37 < landkommunenhipp:#liferay> I am running 6.2-ga4
10:37 < landkommunenhipp:#liferay> Thanks in advance. :)
10:45 < jardineworks_:#liferay> landkommunenhipp: so for me, here is what I did. I logged in as the admin and added the search portlet to a page. Then I configured it removing all facets except the "User" one (I don't have any organizations). While logged in as the admin, I did a search for "test" which returned results (I have several "test" users in my database right now). I logged out so that I became a "guest" user. The search portlet
10:45 < jardineworks_:#liferay> is still visible and when I ran the same search, I got the same results.
10:45 < jardineworks_:#liferay> so I am able to search for users, when I am not logged in, using the default behaviour.
10:46 < jardineworks_:#liferay> you are not?
10:46 < landkommunenhipp:#liferay> No i am not.
10:46 < landkommunenhipp:#liferay> And I really wonder why.
10:48 < jardineworks_:#liferay> interesting.
10:48 < jardineworks_:#liferay> what is it that  you changed to make it work?
10:48 < jardineworks_:#liferay> can you codeshare.io the change with me?
10:49 < jardineworks_:#liferay> has someone configured the portlet so that Guest users can't view it?
10:52 < landkommunenhipp:#liferay> No, it is used out of the box as far as I know.
10:52 < landkommunenhipp:#liferay> I did not codeshar.io anything yet. But we can try it.
10:52 < landkommunenhipp:#liferay> I try to explain it:
10:52 < landkommunenhipp:#liferay> I navigated to /PATH/TO/LIFERAY/liferay-portal-6.2-ce-ga4/tomcat-7.0.42/webapps/ROOT/WEB-INF/lib/ and copied portal-impl.jar.
10:52 < landkommunenhipp:#liferay> I opened it and extracted the portal.xml within  resource-actions/ dir inside the jar.
10:53 < landkommunenhipp:#liferay> Then I searched for <model-resource><model-name>com.liferay.portal.model.User< .. > and removed the following Entry:
10:53 < landkommunenhipp:#liferay> <guest-unsupported> <action-key>VIEW</action-key></guest-unsupported>
10:53 < landkommunenhipp:#liferay> After doing this the Guest-Users are able to look for Users when using the search Portlet.
10:53 < landkommunenhipp:#liferay> Or better said this is what I have done.
10:53 < landkommunenhipp:#liferay> I try a newly set up liferay portal now.
10:54 < jardineworks_:#liferay> oh!
10:55 < jardineworks_:#liferay> I see... you are able to SEARCH for users when you are not logged in, but you are not able to SEE them (the details) when you click on the results. Is that it?
10:55 < jardineworks_:#liferay> oh wait. Interesting.
10:56 < jardineworks_:#liferay> I can see the user entries in a facet on the left, but there are not User "result" entries on the right
10:56 < jardineworks_:#liferay> so perhaps I have the same result as you afterall.
10:57 < landkommunenhipp:#liferay> ok
10:57 < jardineworks_:#liferay> ok -- yes, when I am logged in, I see the "user objects" in the result as well.
10:57 < landkommunenhipp:#liferay> Yes. I that is the behaviour.
10:57 < jardineworks_:#liferay> so there appears to be a bug there :)
10:57 < landkommunenhipp:#liferay> Strange I think :)
10:57 < jardineworks_:#liferay> we shouldn't see the users in the faceted nav, if they are not in the results list.
10:58 < jardineworks_:#liferay> ok -- gimme a few more minutes.
10:58 < landkommunenhipp:#liferay> With organizations this bug is not there. So the organizations do not appear at the facets and are not shown either. But I can activate them the way I described.
10:58 < landkommunenhipp:#liferay> Ok. Thank you. :)
10:59 < jardineworks_:#liferay> I think I have an alternate solution for you that does not require changing the portal core.. but let me test it.
11:03 < jardineworks_:#liferay> damn
11:03 < jardineworks_:#liferay> I thought perhaps you could modify the permissions for the "Guest" user Role. I was able to change the role to have VIEW for Users as an option, but it is not a resource model, I think it is for the portlet.
11:04 < jardineworks_:#liferay> so It looks like you have to do what you are doing, but there is still a more "Standard way" to do it.. and an alternative to consider.
11:05 < jardineworks_:#liferay> 1. Standard way: Any time you want to change something that is part of the portal core, you should use an EXT plugin. They should only be used when absolutely necessary though because they can be a bit painful to maintain and make your upgrade path more painful.
11:05 < jardineworks_:#liferay> by the same token though, it means that you are not changing the core code, you are OVERLAYING your changes so upgrade is still an option.
