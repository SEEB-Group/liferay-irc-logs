06:36 < hufg:#liferay> hello!
06:37 < hufg:#liferay> anyone used custom folder permissions in document library for some role?
06:37 < hufg:#liferay> like restrict access only for this folder
10:11 < jardineworks_:#liferay> landkommunenhipp: Maybe I can help :)
10:11 < jardineworks_:#liferay> oh wait
10:12 < jardineworks_:#liferay> just saw that you found a solution lol.
10:12 < jardineworks_:#liferay> nevermind :)
10:13 < landkommunenhipp:#liferay> thank you anyway.
10:14 < landkommunenhipp:#liferay> What was your solution?
10:14 < landkommunenhipp:#liferay> I modified the portal.xml file inside portal-impl.jar.
10:14 < landkommunenhipp:#liferay> This is maybe not the best way, since you can not ratrace it well.
10:32 < jardineworks_:#liferay> hufg: ack!
10:32 < jardineworks_:#liferay> landkommunenhipp: I don't think you should to that boss.
10:33 < landkommunenhipp:#liferay> What is the solution then?
10:33 < jardineworks_:#liferay> landkommunenhipp: to make sure I understand... you want to allow users who are not logged in to search for other users and organizations?
10:35 < landkommunenhipp:#liferay> jip
10:35 < landkommunenhipp:#liferay> That is exactly what I want to do.
10:35 < landkommunenhipp:#liferay> For some Background Information: This is some kind of legacy Application. Organizations are used as representations for companies which Users can vote for.
10:35 < landkommunenhipp:#liferay> Unauthenticated Users shall see them anyway to get some basic information about the companies as well.
10:36 < jardineworks_:#liferay> landkommunenhipp: ok -- give me a few minutes to check a few things.
10:36 < jardineworks_:#liferay> landkommunenhipp: you are using the "search" portlet right?
