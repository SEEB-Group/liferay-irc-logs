09:13 < landkommunenhipp:#liferay> Hello Everyone!
09:13 < landkommunenhipp:#liferay> Can anybody help me to configure the SearchPortlet so that Anauthenticated users can search for Users and Organizations?
09:13 < landkommunenhipp:#liferay> Thanks in advance. :-)
09:15 < landkommunenhipp:#liferay> Some additional Data: I am running Liferay CE 6.2 ga4.
11:37 < landkommunenhipp:#liferay> I found a solution.
16:32 < steadystatic:#liferay> Not sure where to look first, but is the liferay-maven-plugin capable of handling Gruntfiles? I’m trying to track down how running a Maven deploy from one directory (that has a Gruntfile) is able to run the Grunt taks like processing Sass files into CSS etc. I don’t think our Liferay instance is using any specifc grunt-maven plugin for Maven…any idea where to confirm this?
16:32 < steadystatic:#liferay> It’s working well, I’m just reverse engineering it now because they wanted to switch to Gulp
16:42 < steadystatic:#liferay> I’m guessing it doesn’t care whether I grunt or gulp it’s just executing something on the cli and building the results to a /target/ folder
17:03 < steadystatic:#liferay> Ah so I guess  ‘mvn package liferay:deploy’ is using the liferay.maven.plugins:liferay-maven-plugin
17:31 < steadystatic:#liferay> I wonder how to track down what each goal is doing in this maven xml? http://dpaste.com/3WWPS74
