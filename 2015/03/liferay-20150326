03:49 < goku_:#liferay> hi, is there any restriction for changing the portal setting from only from localhost domain ,like that?
03:49 < goku_:#liferay> in liferay 6.2 ga
06:10 < twen:#liferay> Question about Metadata field.. I've setup a metadata field with a text filed in it. A document is suing this metadata set (via a document type). If I edit the name (not the label) of the metadata field... is the value saved for the document, still saved.. or is it lost ?
06:13 < twen:#liferay> Oh... I found the answers ^^
06:30 < modd_:#liferay> twen: is it lost? ;)
06:32 < twen:#liferay> well.. the message in bright orange says : you might lose the data....
06:33 < twen:#liferay> I stopped before trying
06:33 < modd_:#liferay> thought so^^
06:34 < modd_:#liferay> but I think it's not complete lost until you "re-save" the entity, because the old information is still in your DB
06:34 < modd_:#liferay> but it's just a guess
06:38 < twen:#liferay> hmm...
06:39 < twen:#liferay> what do you mind with entity... the document ?
06:41 < twen:#liferay> For me, it seems liferay doesn't use an internal ID for the field, but uses the name, that can be too easily change and mistyped.. That's a mistake in the concept in Liferay... Or am I wrong?
06:48 < modd_:#liferay> maybe, I don't know :\
07:04 < Axxell:#liferay> Hi.. trying to test to upgrade from liferay CE 6.2 ga3 to Liferay EE 6.2 SP9, which fails on journal verify
07:04 < Axxell:#liferay> with a nullpointerexception
07:39 < Axxell:#liferay> is sp9 an "older" version than ga3?`
07:39 < Axxell:#liferay> why would the upgrade fail?
07:42 < modd_:#liferay> afair GA3 was released after SP9, but I'm not sure
08:34 < Axxell:#liferay> hmm still cant find a good reason why i would get an null poinerexception
08:54 < modd_:#liferay> any other infos in the stacktrace?
09:24 < Axxell:#liferay> not really, wonder  if its the same thing i just remembered i had earlier: structures with the field typ of ddm-decimal would not have its type attribute set and crash the whole thing

11:14 < twen:#liferay> Is there a way in the Document & Media to display the title of a file, and not the filename ? (as title of a picture, or MP3) ?
12:03 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf: are you super busy or can I use you as a rubber duck?
12:08 <@jhf:#liferay> super busy for the next 3 hours :(
12:15 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf: no worries. if you have time later, I would appreciate the time :)
12:48 < urug_:#liferay> hi, is there a way to obtain OrderByComparator instance in template?
12:56 < urug_:#liferay> or maybe orderByComparatorFactory
13:04 < urug_:#liferay> I was trying the portal.getClass().forName() trick, but unfortunatelly not working in Freemarker
13:32 < urug_:#liferay> i wonder which utils the utillocator can actually locate
16:28 <@jhf:#liferay> urug_:
16:28 <@jhf:#liferay> you can but only with FreeMarker
16:28 <@jhf:#liferay> see https://www.liferay.com/community/forums/-/message_boards/message/50367059
16:29 <@jhf:#liferay>  2<#assign OrderByComparatorFactoryUtil = staticUtil["com.liferay.portal.kernel.util.OrderByComparatorFactoryUtil"]>
16:29 <@jhf:#liferay>  3<#assign categoriesOrderBy = OrderByComparatorFactoryUtil.create("AssetCategory", ["modifiedDate", false])>
16:29 <@jhf:#liferay> it's freemarker-only due to the use of staticUtil which does not exist in Velocity AFAIK
16:52 < urug_:#liferay> @jhf thx, I'll try it tommorow
