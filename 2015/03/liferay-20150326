03:49 < goku_:#liferay> hi, is there any restriction for changing the portal setting from only from localhost domain ,like that?
03:49 < goku_:#liferay> in liferay 6.2 ga
06:10 < twen:#liferay> Question about Metadata field.. I've setup a metadata field with a text filed in it. A document is suing this metadata set (via a document type). If I edit the name (not the label) of the metadata field... is the value saved for the document, still saved.. or is it lost ?
06:13 < twen:#liferay> Oh... I found the answers ^^
06:30 < modd_:#liferay> twen: is it lost? ;)
06:32 < twen:#liferay> well.. the message in bright orange says : you might lose the data....
06:33 < twen:#liferay> I stopped before trying
06:33 < modd_:#liferay> thought so^^
06:34 < modd_:#liferay> but I think it's not complete lost until you "re-save" the entity, because the old information is still in your DB
06:34 < modd_:#liferay> but it's just a guess
06:38 < twen:#liferay> hmm...
06:39 < twen:#liferay> what do you mind with entity... the document ?
06:41 < twen:#liferay> For me, it seems liferay doesn't use an internal ID for the field, but uses the name, that can be too easily change and mistyped.. That's a mistake in the concept in Liferay... Or am I wrong?
06:48 < modd_:#liferay> maybe, I don't know :\
07:04 < Axxell:#liferay> Hi.. trying to test to upgrade from liferay CE 6.2 ga3 to Liferay EE 6.2 SP9, which fails on journal verify
07:04 < Axxell:#liferay> with a nullpointerexception
07:39 < Axxell:#liferay> is sp9 an "older" version than ga3?`
07:39 < Axxell:#liferay> why would the upgrade fail?
