05:12 < Cyberkatze:#liferay> hi
06:17 < winem_:#liferay> hi. could need some quick help. I know where I configure the URLs for sites in liferay... but there was a setting where I can set the url for the whole portal and not per site. but I can't find it again
06:19 < winem_:#liferay> when I go to the site administration and klick on "site URL" it says: Enter the friendly URL that will be used by both public and private pages. The friendly URL is appended to http://edit.xxx.com/web for public pages and http://edit.xxx.com/group for private pages. "
06:19 < winem_:#liferay> so I would like to change edit.xxx.com to edit.yyy.com
06:21 < Cyberkatze:#liferay> i think this is in config file
06:21 < winem_:#liferay> I already checked the portal-ext.properties and portal-setup-wizard.properties
06:21 < winem_:#liferay> did I miss one?
06:22 < Cyberkatze:#liferay> ah. no
06:22 < Cyberkatze:#liferay> configuration -> portal settings -> Virtual Host
06:23 < winem_:#liferay> the project started and has been stopped some months ago and now it continued and I forgot some stuff...
06:23 < winem_:#liferay> oh, let me check
06:24 < winem_:#liferay> ok, the value was set to localhost until now. let me check if it fixes that anyway?
06:25 < Cyberkatze:#liferay> hm.. on me this  : xxx.myhost.com
06:25 < winem_:#liferay> no changes
06:28 < winem_:#liferay> ok. it works
