05:12 < Cyberkatze:#liferay> hi
06:17 < winem_:#liferay> hi. could need some quick help. I know where I configure the URLs for sites in liferay... but there was a setting where I can set the url for the whole portal and not per site. but I can't find it again
06:19 < winem_:#liferay> when I go to the site administration and klick on "site URL" it says: Enter the friendly URL that will be used by both public and private pages. The friendly URL is appended to http://edit.xxx.com/web for public pages and http://edit.xxx.com/group for private pages. "
06:19 < winem_:#liferay> so I would like to change edit.xxx.com to edit.yyy.com
06:21 < Cyberkatze:#liferay> i think this is in config file
06:21 < winem_:#liferay> I already checked the portal-ext.properties and portal-setup-wizard.properties
06:21 < winem_:#liferay> did I miss one?
06:22 < Cyberkatze:#liferay> ah. no
06:22 < Cyberkatze:#liferay> configuration -> portal settings -> Virtual Host
06:23 < winem_:#liferay> the project started and has been stopped some months ago and now it continued and I forgot some stuff...
06:23 < winem_:#liferay> oh, let me check
06:24 < winem_:#liferay> ok, the value was set to localhost until now. let me check if it fixes that anyway?
06:25 < Cyberkatze:#liferay> hm.. on me this  : xxx.myhost.com
06:25 < winem_:#liferay> no changes
06:28 < winem_:#liferay> ok. it works
06:29 < Cyberkatze:#liferay> :) how?
06:29 < Cyberkatze:#liferay> found here:
06:29 < Cyberkatze:#liferay> https://www.permeance.com.au/web/flavius.daca/home/-/blogs/migrating-liferay-to-a-different-virtual-host
06:29 < winem_:#liferay> the url in the text when I go to site settings and site url does not change, but liferay acceppts the new domain :)
06:30 < winem_:#liferay> ok, and the text changed after I logged out and back in again :)
06:30 < winem_:#liferay> thanks!
06:30 < Cyberkatze:#liferay> yw
06:31 < winem_:#liferay> I hope that our liferay projects start now and that I will work continuously with it. I love how easy and powerful it is and I dream about migration all our backends to liferay portlets. the dreams of an admin would come true
06:34 < Cyberkatze:#liferay> :)
06:36 < Cyberkatze:#liferay> do u know , how can i set redirect url for results in search-portlet in own theme?
06:40 < sm`:#liferay> hello
06:41 < sm`:#liferay> im trying to change a locale in users session
06:41 < sm`:#liferay> req.getSession().setAttribute(org.apache.struts.Globals.LOCALE_KEY,
06:41 < sm`:#liferay> 					locale);
06:41 < sm`:#liferay> is what i found in the forums
06:41 < sm`:#liferay> is that the way to go with this?
06:42 < Cyberkatze:#liferay> why u need change locale in session?
06:43 < sm`:#liferay> i need to re-set as a matter of fack
06:43 < sm`:#liferay> its kind of a 'login'
06:43 < sm`:#liferay> so i need to invalidate his session
06:46 < sm`:#liferay> but after i invalidate()
06:46 < sm`:#liferay> the language changes to the user
06:47 < sm`:#liferay> so what i wanna do is get the locale before i invalidate, invalidate(), create new session and set the locale/language
06:49 < Cyberkatze:#liferay> https://www.liferay.com/de/community/forums/-/message_boards/message/25256609
06:58 < sm`:#liferay> whats the LOCALE_KEY there, it doesnt seem to be in any of the suggested pkgs in the ide
