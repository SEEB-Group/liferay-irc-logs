11:15 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey jhf
11:15 <@jhf:#liferay> jardineworks: !
11:15 <@jhf:#liferay> whats up
11:15 < jardineworks:#liferay> nothing much -- just saying hey :)
11:16 <@jhf:#liferay> cool.. was on vacation thu/fri last week but back now
11:16 <@jhf:#liferay> was up in your neck of the woods in fact
11:16 <@jhf:#liferay> in northern minnesota right on the CA border for some ice fishing
11:19 < jardineworks:#liferay> nice! -- though we have a pretty big border. You weren't that close to me lol
11:19 < jardineworks:#liferay> did you catch anything good?
11:21 < jardineworks_:#liferay> woah -- my computer just got really mad at me :)
11:22 <@jhf:#liferay> we caught a few Walleye but nothing amazing. like maybe 5-8 pounders
11:22 <@jhf:#liferay> lots of whitefish which we renamed "Tilapia" :)
11:22 <@jhf:#liferay> a few Saugers
11:23 < jardineworks_:#liferay> I'm gonna pretend I know what most of what you said means :)
11:23 < jardineworks_:#liferay> sounds fun though -- I've never been ice fishing.
11:23 <@jhf:#liferay> hah
11:23 <@jhf:#liferay> Sauger, Walleye, Whitefish - standard kinds of fish found in this lake (Lake of the Woods)
11:23 < jardineworks_:#liferay> I did some deep sea fishing once in the keys ... which was alright. A lotta sittin' around though. Seems like more of a drinking game than anything
11:24 <@jhf:#liferay> Walleye is the most sought-after fish in the area, the fish we caught could go for $25 on the open market
11:24 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah pretty much and excuse to sit around and drink
11:24 < jardineworks_:#liferay> do yo guys catch and release? or catch and dine?
11:25 <@jhf:#liferay> if the fish are between a certain size, you have to throw them back (that size range is the size at which they produce the most offspring)
11:25 <@jhf:#liferay> but other than that, it's fish fry time
11:25 < jardineworks_:#liferay> nice
11:25 < jardineworks_:#liferay> :)
11:25 <@jhf:#liferay> the smaller ones you can't make big filets, so you chop them up and smoke 'em
11:26 <@jhf:#liferay> the guys we were with are gonna smoke most of them and bring them to symposium in november in chicago
