04:00 < urug_:#liferay> Which permissions do I need to be able to Browse By Structure in site administration?
04:55 < Axxell:#liferay> Hey guys, i fixed my db problems which were again corrupt xml in journalarticle
04:56 < Axxell:#liferay> but now a new problem i get the following error in the control panel when trying to look at the site structure:
04:56 < Axxell:#liferay> org.apache.jasper.JasperException: Unable to compile class for JSP: ____An error occurred at line: 595 in the jsp file: /html/portlet/layouts_admin/tree_js.jsp__The method getLayoutsJSON(HttpServletRequest, long, boolean, long, boolean, String) in the type LayoutsTreeUtil is not applicable for the arguments (HttpServletRequest, long, boolean, long, long[], boolean)__592: 			<%__593: 			long[] openNodes = StringUtil.split(SessionTreeJSC

04:57 < Axxell:#liferay> what could possible create this?
05:03 < urug_:#liferay> tree_js.jsp was modified in GA3, so maybe it could relate somehow?
05:40 < Axxell:#liferay> urug_: yup seems so, fixed by adding treeid to the function
05:40 < Axxell:#liferay> in tree_js.jsp
05:43 < urug_:#liferay> Have you been using modified tree_js.jsp or is it actually bug in a new version?
06:08 < urug_:#liferay> What's causing this ERROR?
06:08 < urug_:#liferay> ERROR [ContainerBackgroundProcessor[StandardEngine[Catalina]]][LayoutTemplateLocalServiceImpl:433] No content found at WAP template path /ffjcu_section.wap.tpl
06:12 < urug_:#liferay> ffjcu_section.wap.tpl is truly empty, but is it a problem? Whould should I do to get rid of the ERROR msg?
06:19 < urug_:#liferay> In liferay-layout-templates there is a <wap-template-path> line, should I remove it? Or set the value to non-mobile version template?
06:21 < urug_:#liferay> Ok, It CAN'T be removed...
06:23 < Axxell:#liferay> i dont think ive modified anything in tree_js.jsp
06:23 < Axxell:#liferay> now in my local installation i did to test it out
06:23 < Axxell:#liferay> maybe some sort of version conflict? where earlier versions did not have that treeid argument in the method?
06:23 < Axxell:#liferay> im gonna make a hook to make it work, anyways
06:24 < Axxell:#liferay> but this is what i do everytime i do an upgrade, go trough all of the bugs. Strange thing is that nobody else is complaining. Either they use liferay in other ways than I, or there is something fishy going on
09:11 < hufg:#liferay> helloo does 6.2 still autocompile sass on request?
09:11 < hufg:#liferay> in 6.1 there was dynamiccssfilter
10:04 < bijoo_:#liferay> Axxell: actually I think I've faced the same; though I just did quick fix as was in rush
