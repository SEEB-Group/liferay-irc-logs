09:12 < modd_:#liferay> hey there. I have really strange problem here. anyone around? jardineworks, topolik? ;)
09:13 < modd_:#liferay> I have a servlet filter, which reads the cookies and depending on one cookie, it adds an attribute to the request
09:13 < modd_:#liferay> in my theme I check, if this attribute exists and if yes, it shows a message
09:13 < modd_:#liferay> so this works just fine for all pages
09:13 < modd_:#liferay> except "host/"
09:14 < modd_:#liferay> if I use "host/" as url, it shows me the welcome page, as expected
09:14 < modd_:#liferay> but most times, the attribute simply never appears, even though I see in the logs the setAttribute message
09:15 < modd_:#liferay> and even more weird: sometimes, if the cookie does not exist, the attribute is not set (which is correct) but the message appears as it finds the attribute
09:17 < modd_:#liferay> any ideas are welcome
09:42 < topolik:#liferay> hi modd_, I'm here
09:42 < topolik:#liferay> let me think about it
09:43 < topolik:#liferay> The servlet filter is in the theme WAR?
09:44 < topolik:#liferay> you check the attribute in the theme portal template or somewhere else?
09:44 < topolik:#liferay> what do you mean by "host/" ... is it http://portal-server/host/ URL?
09:45 < modd_:#liferay> nope, it's in another project
09:45 < modd_:#liferay> what I'm doing is:
09:46 < modd_:#liferay> in the doFilter method:
