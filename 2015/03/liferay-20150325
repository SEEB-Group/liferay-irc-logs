04:24 < twen:#liferay> hello
05:56 < winem_:#liferay> good morning, I could need some help installing themes from the liferay market
05:57 < winem_:#liferay> I purchased 2 themes for a project with my name as entity and the web forms and resource importer module
05:57 < winem_:#liferay> it says everything is installed but I can't choose any of the templates in the site overview
05:57 < winem_:#liferay> what am I doing wrong?
06:03 < winem_:#liferay> I see one of both themes in control panel -> sites -> site templates
06:05 < winem_:#liferay> but not the 2nd one. anyone an idea? I guess I make a stupid mistake or mithing something
06:07 < winem_:#liferay> the 2nd theme is called pixelpress. not sure if this might help
06:12 < winem_:#liferay> and how important is the supported liferay version of a theme? will a theme for 6.2 GA2 work on GA3 also?
06:42 < winem_:#liferay> ok, seems to work for now.
06:42 < winem_:#liferay> now, I have another question and trying to fix this caused conflicts between the settings in the GUI and portal-ext.properties
10:07 < jardineworks:#liferay> good mroning guys
10:07 < jardineworks:#liferay> does anyone in here use Liferay in an elastic cloud environment?
10:07 < jardineworks:#liferay> Liferay EE that is...
