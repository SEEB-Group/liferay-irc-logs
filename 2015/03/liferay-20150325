04:24 < twen:#liferay> hello
05:56 < winem_:#liferay> good morning, I could need some help installing themes from the liferay market
05:57 < winem_:#liferay> I purchased 2 themes for a project with my name as entity and the web forms and resource importer module
05:57 < winem_:#liferay> it says everything is installed but I can't choose any of the templates in the site overview
05:57 < winem_:#liferay> what am I doing wrong?
06:03 < winem_:#liferay> I see one of both themes in control panel -> sites -> site templates
06:05 < winem_:#liferay> but not the 2nd one. anyone an idea? I guess I make a stupid mistake or mithing something
06:07 < winem_:#liferay> the 2nd theme is called pixelpress. not sure if this might help
06:12 < winem_:#liferay> and how important is the supported liferay version of a theme? will a theme for 6.2 GA2 work on GA3 also?
06:42 < winem_:#liferay> ok, seems to work for now.
06:42 < winem_:#liferay> now, I have another question and trying to fix this caused conflicts between the settings in the GUI and portal-ext.properties
10:07 < jardineworks:#liferay> good mroning guys
10:07 < jardineworks:#liferay> does anyone in here use Liferay in an elastic cloud environment?
10:07 < jardineworks:#liferay> Liferay EE that is...

10:22 < jardineworks:#liferay> \o/ a liferay guy! I have a licensing question for you jhf
10:22 < jardineworks:#liferay> two actually
10:23 < jardineworks:#liferay> 1. are EE customers allowed to use CE licenses? basically mixed licenses in their environment?
10:25 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah, no problem, although if they are too far apart in versions then you run the risk of incompatibility
10:25 <@jhf:#liferay> you should also be aware that SI partners of Liferay can't "do CE deals"
10:34 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf: What does that mean? they are not allowed to work on CE versions of the product for customers?
10:44 <@jhf:#liferay> well, I can't find it on the web to verify, but https://www.liferay.com/partners/become-a-partner says you have to "maintain sales targets"
10:44 <@jhf:#liferay> and since CE is free...
10:47 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf: I see. But a client who is licensed is free to use both if they so choose. (you'll understand why I ask in a second)
10:48 <@jhf:#liferay> yep, they can use EE and CE at the same time in their business.
10:48 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf: 2. License files. They're tied to MAC addresses right? so for clients that have virtualized environments, what kind of options does Liferay offer? Basically, lets say I have a DEV environment that has been wrecked. I want to blow away the image and spin up a new one. But I might not be able to maintain the same MAC address (I know there are ways, but humor me for the moment).
10:49 < jardineworks:#liferay> is there a "open MAC" address license?
10:49 < jardineworks:#liferay> or a licensing server maybe?
10:49 <@jhf:#liferay> I don't *think* we have an automated way to handle that case. I *think* it's a case-by-case basis. It's a good question for provisioning@liferay.com
10:50 <@jhf:#liferay> I doubt there is an "open MAC address license"
10:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf: ok... I just found out this morning that there are options to maintain a Network Interface stack ... seperate from the images, and then to bind them to images as you spin them up. But in the case of OpenStack, apparently, this requires an ESX server which is big bucks. I'll shoot an email over to the provisioning email address though -- thanks :)
10:52 < modd_:#liferay> with 6.1 I was surprised as my copied dev environment from an old machine worked without problems on the new machine. MACs were of course different
