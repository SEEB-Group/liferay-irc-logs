07:44 < hufg:#liferay> wazap
08:29 < hufg:#liferay> helloo helloo
08:29 < hufg:#liferay> anyone familiar with angular portlets and the bower node npm maven grunt madness
08:30 < hufg:#liferay> would be great to have a best practices guide hehe
08:31 < hufg:#liferay> this is pretty neat though https://github.com/nonblocking/liferay-angularjs-portlet

10:44 < twen:#liferay> Are the metadata set limited to a site or global to all liferay sites ?
10:44 < twen:#liferay> (hello)
12:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> seriously? Liferay supports multi-instance, but the page not found friendly url is not company specific?
12:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> fail.
12:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> personal gripe. Everything in the PropsValues should use PrefsPropsUtil with the company id.. instead of the propsutil.
12:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf: how do I get that one in the next release? :)
12:14 <@jhf:#liferay> jardineworks: imlpement it and issue a pull request :)
12:14 <@jhf:#liferay> but before that I'd recommend starting a thread on the forums
12:15 <@jhf:#liferay> because it might already be in the works, OR someone might have a better idea or feedback on yours :)
12:17 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf: it's not small job .. I think that is probably why it hasn;t been done yet lol
12:18 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf: but I will start a thread to see what people think. Right now I can only think of two options. 1. use the proxy to redirect based on the host. 2. use a struts action hook that will redirect to a page based on the company.
12:18 < jardineworks:#liferay> but I am coming across this quite a bit -- this client uses the portal instance model A LOT.
12:19 <@jhf:#liferay> ok start it here: https://www.liferay.com/community/forums/-/message_boards/category/1108052
12:19 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: haha, I found the same irritating; did you tame the caching issue you had? Sorry I was too tired to test it; though in my heart I want to find the root.
12:19 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: plus can easily override the page: error.jsp
12:19 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: only if you want custom theme, need more.
12:21 < bijoo_:#liferay> layout.friendly.url.page.not.found=/errors/redirectToError.jsp ?
12:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo_: each instance has a custom theme of course because they are all individual applications.
12:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo_: I finished the  final touches on the ehcache replication using TCP unicast this morning.
12:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> works like a cahrm
12:21 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: okay, then yes, it is not straightforward.
12:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> I'm going to reply to my own thread today/tomorrow with the details.
12:22 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: fantastic, thanks for shedding light on that.
12:22 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf: can we talk about distributed applications?!
12:22 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo_: it was hell. I was deep in the bowels of both Liferay and JGroups until about 9pm (EST) last night.
12:23 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo_: basically configuration problems. The shitty part was that it LOOKED like it was working at startup because I was getting those big chunks of logging talking about the channel creation. A closer inspection though and I realized that it was FAILING to load my configuration and using the defaults provided by jgroups!
12:23 < jardineworks:#liferay> but then I figured it out... and saw one beautiful line of logging
12:24 < jardineworks:#liferay> 16:20:00,720 INFO  [Incoming-11,shared=yp_cache][DebuggingClusterEventListenerImpl:57] Cluster event JOIN_Cluster node {clusterNodeId=6a346e3f-b459-4d00-8fe1-ad9b86903706, inetAddress=/192.168.56.113, port=-1} [Sanitized]
12:24 < jardineworks:#liferay> almost shed a little tear when I saw that
12:25 < jardineworks:#liferay> Liferay has made me a much better developer. I don't think I have read as much code in my entire career as I have in the last 3 - 4 years :)
13:39 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: haha, that's cool; so port was not correct?
13:39 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: me too, especially Service Builder
13:40 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: I hope we find ways to update Liferay; e.g. to improve dev cycle and all; annotations instead of xml (e.g. service.xml option)
14:24 < plekplek:#liferay> has anyone looked into creating a function for copying document library entries from one folder to another?
14:43 < d0nkeyBOB:#liferay> Hello, can anybody help me with this problem? https://www.liferay.com/community/forums/-/message_boards/message/49942597
14:44 < d0nkeyBOB:#liferay> Trying to test services and everything i've found, dopesn't work correctly
