07:44 < hufg:#liferay> wazap
08:29 < hufg:#liferay> helloo helloo
08:29 < hufg:#liferay> anyone familiar with angular portlets and the bower node npm maven grunt madness
08:30 < hufg:#liferay> would be great to have a best practices guide hehe
08:31 < hufg:#liferay> this is pretty neat though https://github.com/nonblocking/liferay-angularjs-portlet

10:44 < twen:#liferay> Are the metadata set limited to a site or global to all liferay sites ?
10:44 < twen:#liferay> (hello)
12:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> seriously? Liferay supports multi-instance, but the page not found friendly url is not company specific?
12:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> fail.
12:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> personal gripe. Everything in the PropsValues should use PrefsPropsUtil with the company id.. instead of the propsutil.
12:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf: how do I get that one in the next release? :)
12:14 <@jhf:#liferay> jardineworks: imlpement it and issue a pull request :)
12:14 <@jhf:#liferay> but before that I'd recommend starting a thread on the forums
12:15 <@jhf:#liferay> because it might already be in the works, OR someone might have a better idea or feedback on yours :)
12:17 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf: it's not small job .. I think that is probably why it hasn;t been done yet lol
12:18 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf: but I will start a thread to see what people think. Right now I can only think of two options. 1. use the proxy to redirect based on the host. 2. use a struts action hook that will redirect to a page based on the company.
12:18 < jardineworks:#liferay> but I am coming across this quite a bit -- this client uses the portal instance model A LOT.
12:19 <@jhf:#liferay> ok start it here: https://www.liferay.com/community/forums/-/message_boards/category/1108052
12:19 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: haha, I found the same irritating; did you tame the caching issue you had? Sorry I was too tired to test it; though in my heart I want to find the root.
12:19 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: plus can easily override the page: error.jsp
