07:42 < goku_:#liferay> hi..i have some queries with the ldap..if the user is removed from liferay..then also am able to login with same credentials .i have checked the enable option in ldap config page.not the required.
07:42 < goku_:#liferay> how to prevent that?

09:27 < goku_:#liferay> hi how to auto sync the user details if one user removed from the ldap server..?
09:28 < goku_:#liferay> in documentation its says that, we have to manually remove the user from liferay
09:28 < goku_:#liferay> is there any work around for this?
09:31 < jardineworks:#liferay> goku_, none that I know of
09:56 < goku_:#liferay> jardineworks: ok
10:00 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo, jhf in case you ever come across this problem -- https://www.liferay.com/community/forums/-/message_boards/message/50125775
10:15 <@jhf:#liferay> wow
10:16 <@jhf:#liferay> gold star for that one jardineworks !!
10:16 <@jhf:#liferay> you should make that a blog post too!
10:17 < jardineworks:#liferay> lol
10:17 < jardineworks:#liferay> I might do that for that one and for the ehcache TCP / Unicast one as well.
10:18 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, https://www.liferay.com/community/forums/-/message_boards/message/49880012
10:18 < jardineworks:#liferay> both of those we're some real doozies to solve.
10:27 < goku_:#liferay> jardineworks: hi is the ldap is checked first or the liferay db is checked first for login..if the ldap is enabled.?
10:30 < jardineworks:#liferay> goku_, LDAP -- but question.. in your authentication settings, do you have he "is required" checkbox CHECKED?
10:33 < goku_:#liferay> jardineworks: no only enabled is checked
10:33 < jardineworks:#liferay> ok
10:34 < jardineworks:#liferay> goku_, so IMHO this is a security hole. Here is what I have found.
10:34 < jardineworks:#liferay> you setup your LDAP and everything works. I come along and I login. The login is validated against LDAP I have the correct user and password. Automagically, a user is creted in Liferay based on the mappings.
10:34 < jardineworks:#liferay> now I change my password in LDAP, or I leave the company and my user is deleted.
10:35 < jardineworks:#liferay> I login with my old credentials. LDAP auth fails, but the fallback (because you don't have REQUIRED checked) is to see if the user is in Liferay
10:35 < jardineworks:#liferay> and because my user/pass IS in liferay (it was imported from LDAP before it was deleted from LDAP)
10:35 < jardineworks:#liferay> I am in.
10:36 < jardineworks:#liferay> Personally, I think if LDAP is enabled, it should automatically be required.
10:38 < goku_:#liferay> jardineworks: ok. one guy saying about extending the  PortalLDAPImporterImpl.java and making the delete sync work(workaround).
10:39 < goku_:#liferay> jardineworks:http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19464130/liferay-user-deactivation-using-ldapimportmessagelistener
10:40 < jardineworks:#liferay> sure that would be an option. But OOTB, I don;t think it is possible.
10:41 < goku_:#liferay> or one another thought .by using login pre event class to do some check with the ldap server and if the user doesn't exists in there then i can invalidate the login action..which is better way?
10:43 < jardineworks:#liferay> both are good options. But can you do the PortalLDAPImporterImpl with a regular hook?
10:44 < jardineworks:#liferay> ext plugins = big flashing warning lights
10:44 < jardineworks:#liferay> the post login hook would be simpler
10:45 < jardineworks:#liferay> both to create, manage and undeploy if necessary
10:45 < goku_:#liferay> jardineworks: hm..any way..let me try these..i think hook is a better option..
10:46 < goku_:#liferay> jardineworks: thanks man
10:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> np
11:19 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey jhf do you know how liferay decides which company is the "main instance"
11:19 < jardineworks:#liferay> ?
11:21 <@jhf:#liferay> I believe it's a portal.properties setting
11:21 <@jhf:#liferay> company.default.*
11:22 < jardineworks:#liferay> hmm
11:23 < jardineworks:#liferay> ah -- the company.default.web.id maybe?
12:03 < josuebc:#liferay> Hi there. I am implementing a restful service within a spring portlet. I am using the Delegate servlet and calling spring's DispatcherServlet. The thing is that I can't retrieve the user frmo the session.
12:04 < josuebc:#liferay> Apparently the servlet is not in the login path. I did notice that I can only access the restful service by going to /my-portlet/rest/{parameter} instead of /delegate/rest/{parameter}.
12:04 < josuebc:#liferay> Any ideas why the request is not going through the Delegate servlet?
12:23 < josuebc:#liferay> Ok, nevermind. I got it.
13:13 < dave_k:#liferay> ... what do I need to search for when I want to create a plugin that only injects CSS and JS into the header of all pages, regardless of the currently used theme? (LR 6.2)
13:17 < jardineworks:#liferay> dave_k, there is a taglib for that I think
13:17 < jardineworks:#liferay> gimme a sec
13:24 < jardineworks:#liferay> dave_k, searching for it... I feel like there is a liferay-util or a liferay-ui for this. It allows you to inject things into the page header
13:25 < jardineworks:#liferay> I used it once for a facebook thingee
13:27 < dave_k:#liferay> jardineworks: thx, but what plugin type do I need for that?
13:27 < jardineworks:#liferay> you want to inject the same css/js on all pages?
13:27 < jardineworks:#liferay> never changes?
13:29 < dave_k:#liferay> jardineworks: correct. just a piece of code that interacts with all elements sporting a certain css class
13:30 < jardineworks:#liferay> dave_k, I think it was liferay-util:html-top
13:30 < jardineworks:#liferay> dave_k, oh -- so you want it in the body tag?
13:31 < jardineworks:#liferay> nevermind
13:31 < jardineworks:#liferay> read your question again
13:31 < jardineworks:#liferay> :)
13:31 < dave_k:#liferay> jardineworks: nope, head is fine
13:31 < jardineworks:#liferay> ..
13:31 < jardineworks:#liferay> and you don't have access to the theme?
13:31 < dave_k:#liferay> header-css and header-javascript?
13:32 < jardineworks:#liferay> where are you seeing that?
