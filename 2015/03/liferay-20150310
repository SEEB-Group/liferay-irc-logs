09:27 < goku_:#liferay> hi how to auto sync the user details if one user removed from the ldap server..?
09:28 < goku_:#liferay> in documentation its says that, we have to manually remove the user from liferay
09:28 < goku_:#liferay> is there any work around for this?
09:31 < jardineworks:#liferay> goku_, none that I know of
09:56 < goku_:#liferay> jardineworks: ok
10:00 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo, jhf in case you ever come across this problem -- https://www.liferay.com/community/forums/-/message_boards/message/50125775
10:15 <@jhf:#liferay> wow
10:16 <@jhf:#liferay> gold star for that one jardineworks !!
10:16 <@jhf:#liferay> you should make that a blog post too!
10:17 < jardineworks:#liferay> lol
10:17 < jardineworks:#liferay> I might do that for that one and for the ehcache TCP / Unicast one as well.
10:18 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, https://www.liferay.com/community/forums/-/message_boards/message/49880012
10:18 < jardineworks:#liferay> both of those we're some real doozies to solve.
10:27 < goku_:#liferay> jardineworks: hi is the ldap is checked first or the liferay db is checked first for login..if the ldap is enabled.?
10:30 < jardineworks:#liferay> goku_, LDAP -- but question.. in your authentication settings, do you have he "is required" checkbox CHECKED?
