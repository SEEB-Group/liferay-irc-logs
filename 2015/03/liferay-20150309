03:43 < twen:#liferay> 'morning
08:53 < jardineworks:#liferay> good morning guys
08:53 < jardineworks:#liferay> and gals
09:23 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik, can you help me with a curl question? I have a hook (StrutsAction) at the portal level that I want to execute. I don't want to make it part of the public path though -- so I want to make sure that a admin session exists as part of the curl request to execute it.
09:23 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik, I think this means I need to curl the login, and then include the cookie in my hook request
09:23 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik, but I can't seem to get the login/cookie generation curl request to work.
09:24 < jardineworks:#liferay> damn :(

11:17 < winem_:#liferay> hi, I'm wondering that liferay is very late with the support of Java 8 which is expected for 6.2 GA4 in july. oracle stops to provide security updates through public mirrors in april. was it the same for the switch from java 6 to 7?
11:36 < d0nkeyBOB:#liferay> anybody have exp. hooking Arquillian up with tomcat, maven and liferay?
11:50 < jardineworks:#liferay> d0nkeyBOB, yes :)
11:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> winem_, not sure to be honest. I know there was a problem at one point with one of the java 7 update versions not working with 6.1
11:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> but I believe it supported 7 for 6.1 when it was release ,... at least up to u21
11:53 < jardineworks:#liferay> winem_, oracle changed something in their api for a security thing.. RasterImage or something after that update -- or u20  or something... that broke a bunch of stuff.
11:53 < jardineworks:#liferay> but the GA3 I think was updated to handle it.
11:54 < jardineworks:#liferay> d0nkeyBOB, I can give you the play by play if you like
11:55 < jardineworks:#liferay> d0nkeyBOB, first thing... in your TOCMAT_HOMT/conf folder update/add a tomcat-users.xml file with this content --
11:55 < jardineworks:#liferay> <?xml version="1.0"?>
11:55 < jardineworks:#liferay> <tomcat-users>
11:55 < jardineworks:#liferay>         <role rolename="tomcat" />
11:55 < jardineworks:#liferay>         <role rolename="manager-gui" />
11:55 < jardineworks:#liferay>         <role rolename="manager-script" />
