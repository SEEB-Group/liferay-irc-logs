09:16 < d0nkeyBOB:#liferay> Has anybody had success in testing their custom services?
09:16 < d0nkeyBOB:#liferay> trying to do integration tests, but not having a good time
09:34 < jardineworks:#liferay> d0nkeyBOB, can you provide a little more detail? when you say services you mean custom service builder stuff?
09:40 < d0nkeyBOB:#liferay> correct. create a custom service and I want to run some test on the crud methods. all documentation i've seen hasn't been working
09:40 < jardineworks:#liferay> some tests as in unit tests?
09:41 < d0nkeyBOB:#liferay> correct. integration tests more likely though. just want to test that my methods read and write correctly
09:43 < d0nkeyBOB:#liferay> tried the InitUtil.initWithSpring(); examples, mockito etc. can't get a successfull add of a record. just didn't know if i'm doing it wrong
09:43 < jardineworks:#liferay> d0nkeyBOB, are your unit tests part of the same portlet plugin project?
09:43 < jardineworks:#liferay> maven or ant?
09:44 < d0nkeyBOB:#liferay> Using Maven. When I used the Liferay archetype, it creates it as a portal project
09:44 < jardineworks:#liferay> yo uused the maven archetype for a servicebuilder portlet though right?
09:44 < d0nkeyBOB:#liferay> yep
09:45 < jardineworks:#liferay> so you have two modules? one with a -portlet-portlet and the other with -portlet-service?
09:45 < d0nkeyBOB:#liferay> though the service will be independent of any gui portlet
09:45 < jardineworks:#liferay> ok -- and your unit tests are in the -portlet-portlet module right?
09:45 < d0nkeyBOB:#liferay> yep
09:45 < d0nkeyBOB:#liferay> yep
09:45 < jardineworks:#liferay> k .. can you show me one of your unit tests?
09:45 < d0nkeyBOB:#liferay> i think the initialzation of the test, add a record and get that record back
09:47 < d0nkeyBOB:#liferay> can you see it here? http://www.codeshare.io/ma36l
09:47 < d0nkeyBOB:#liferay> its just a basic test
09:48 < jardineworks:#liferay> I can see that. And whats the exception you get?
09:49 < d0nkeyBOB:#liferay> no exception
09:49 < d0nkeyBOB:#liferay> brb
09:50 < jardineworks:#liferay> but the test is failing?
09:50 < jardineworks:#liferay> can you show me your service.xml?
10:04 < d0nkeyBOB:#liferay> back. the main problem that i'm having is just the intialization of the test within my environment. with this particuler test.
10:05 < d0nkeyBOB:#liferay> the service works fine outside of the test
10:05 < d0nkeyBOB:#liferay> but just running test on the add aof the connection
10:06 < d0nkeyBOB:#liferay> i've tried examples like this one -> http://blog.open.gr/2014/06/plugin-unit-testing-in-liferay-6-2/
10:10 < d0nkeyBOB:#liferay> then i get messages like this "infinite loop in property interpolation of -contents"
10:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> d0nkeyBOB, can you send me your project?
10:13 < d0nkeyBOB:#liferay> eh, not really. its a large company code base.
10:13 < d0nkeyBOB:#liferay> sorry
10:14 < d0nkeyBOB:#liferay> the workflow is to just create a service, then test crud functioning on that service
10:15 < d0nkeyBOB:#liferay> the funny thing is, i can make "getall" type calls and its works, but when i do an add data type function, it fails
10:16 < d0nkeyBOB:#liferay> i get a null response and getall doesn't return anything
10:22 < jardineworks:#liferay> can you share the service.xml entity definition at least?
10:22 < jardineworks:#liferay> the way you create the entity in your unit test is a little unorthodox.
10:22 < jardineworks:#liferay> but I would expect the failure to generate an exception
10:23 < jardineworks:#liferay> not just assert to false.
10:23 < jardineworks:#liferay> can you add an assertion for not null before you test the name to make sure that the connection object is not null? (guessing it is not because you said there are no null pointers being thrown, but just to double check)
