09:16 < d0nkeyBOB:#liferay> Has anybody had success in testing their custom services?
09:16 < d0nkeyBOB:#liferay> trying to do integration tests, but not having a good time
09:34 < jardineworks:#liferay> d0nkeyBOB, can you provide a little more detail? when you say services you mean custom service builder stuff?
09:40 < d0nkeyBOB:#liferay> correct. create a custom service and I want to run some test on the crud methods. all documentation i've seen hasn't been working
09:40 < jardineworks:#liferay> some tests as in unit tests?
09:41 < d0nkeyBOB:#liferay> correct. integration tests more likely though. just want to test that my methods read and write correctly
09:43 < d0nkeyBOB:#liferay> tried the InitUtil.initWithSpring(); examples, mockito etc. can't get a successfull add of a record. just didn't know if i'm doing it wrong
09:43 < jardineworks:#liferay> d0nkeyBOB, are your unit tests part of the same portlet plugin project?
09:43 < jardineworks:#liferay> maven or ant?
09:44 < d0nkeyBOB:#liferay> Using Maven. When I used the Liferay archetype, it creates it as a portal project
09:44 < jardineworks:#liferay> yo uused the maven archetype for a servicebuilder portlet though right?
09:44 < d0nkeyBOB:#liferay> yep
09:45 < jardineworks:#liferay> so you have two modules? one with a -portlet-portlet and the other with -portlet-service?
09:45 < d0nkeyBOB:#liferay> though the service will be independent of any gui portlet
09:45 < jardineworks:#liferay> ok -- and your unit tests are in the -portlet-portlet module right?
09:45 < d0nkeyBOB:#liferay> yep
09:45 < d0nkeyBOB:#liferay> yep
09:45 < jardineworks:#liferay> k .. can you show me one of your unit tests?
09:45 < d0nkeyBOB:#liferay> i think the initialzation of the test, add a record and get that record back
09:47 < d0nkeyBOB:#liferay> can you see it here? http://www.codeshare.io/ma36l
09:47 < d0nkeyBOB:#liferay> its just a basic test
09:48 < jardineworks:#liferay> I can see that. And whats the exception you get?
09:49 < d0nkeyBOB:#liferay> no exception
09:49 < d0nkeyBOB:#liferay> brb
09:50 < jardineworks:#liferay> but the test is failing?
09:50 < jardineworks:#liferay> can you show me your service.xml?
10:04 < d0nkeyBOB:#liferay> back. the main problem that i'm having is just the intialization of the test within my environment. with this particuler test.
10:05 < d0nkeyBOB:#liferay> the service works fine outside of the test
10:05 < d0nkeyBOB:#liferay> but just running test on the add aof the connection
10:06 < d0nkeyBOB:#liferay> i've tried examples like this one -> http://blog.open.gr/2014/06/plugin-unit-testing-in-liferay-6-2/
10:10 < d0nkeyBOB:#liferay> then i get messages like this "infinite loop in property interpolation of -contents"
10:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> d0nkeyBOB, can you send me your project?
10:13 < d0nkeyBOB:#liferay> eh, not really. its a large company code base.
10:13 < d0nkeyBOB:#liferay> sorry
10:14 < d0nkeyBOB:#liferay> the workflow is to just create a service, then test crud functioning on that service
10:15 < d0nkeyBOB:#liferay> the funny thing is, i can make "getall" type calls and its works, but when i do an add data type function, it fails
10:16 < d0nkeyBOB:#liferay> i get a null response and getall doesn't return anything
10:22 < jardineworks:#liferay> can you share the service.xml entity definition at least?
10:22 < jardineworks:#liferay> the way you create the entity in your unit test is a little unorthodox.
10:22 < jardineworks:#liferay> but I would expect the failure to generate an exception
10:23 < jardineworks:#liferay> not just assert to false.
10:23 < jardineworks:#liferay> can you add an assertion for not null before you test the name to make sure that the connection object is not null? (guessing it is not because you said there are no null pointers being thrown, but just to double check)
10:27 < d0nkeyBOB:#liferay> here is my service xml entity -> http://www.codeshare.io/RtNZs

10:38 < jardineworks:#liferay> d0nkeyBOB, not sure of the exact syntax for method names etc, but I updated that link
10:43 < d0nkeyBOB:#liferay> let me try it
10:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> plekplek, any luck with that hook last night?
11:03 -!- mode/#liferay [+o jhf] by ChanServ
11:06 < d0nkeyBOB:#liferay> hi, new problem . . . .java.lang.AssertionError on the first notNull
11:06 < d0nkeyBOB:#liferay> Assert.assertNotNull(connection) and assertNotNull(connection) don't work
11:06 < d0nkeyBOB:#liferay> using junit4
11:07 -!- mode/#liferay [+o _jhf_] by ChanServ
11:13 < jardineworks:#liferay> d0nkeyBOB, don't work as is those objects are in fact null? or don't work as in those methods are not available?
11:18 < d0nkeyBOB:#liferay> think its because the methods are not avaiable
11:31 < d0nkeyBOB:#liferay> looking at it now, seems like the object returned is null
11:34 < d0nkeyBOB:#liferay> quick question . . .would you Mock the service or run a spring instance to test?
11:40 < jardineworks:#liferay> usually I mock
11:40 < jardineworks:#liferay> except for the portal services... I'm starting to use arquillian for those
11:42 < d0nkeyBOB:#liferay> i just saw an article about that. does it help?
11:57 < jardineworks:#liferay> its saves me from having to mock all the portal services.
11:57 < jardineworks:#liferay> so I like it
11:58 < jardineworks:#liferay> and it'll be even better when the ability to auto-mock Request objets is added.
12:03 < d0nkeyBOB:#liferay> ah. i saw something about but didn't know if it helped. thanks
14:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> has anyone every added a spring configuration to a LiferayMVC Portlet that uses the auto-scan to pick up the bean definitions?
14:27 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, have you ever tried using spring annotations in a LiferayMVC portlet?
14:44 <@jhf:#liferay> nope - I have never seriously used spring for anything :(
14:47 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, boo. I have it working for the regular xml defintion file .. pretty cool, there is a SpringHotDeployListener tht runs for portlets. You add 	<context-param>
14:47 < jardineworks:#liferay> 		<param-name>portalContextConfigLocation</param-name>
14:47 < jardineworks:#liferay> 		<param-value>WEB-INF/classes/META-INF/mybeans-spring.xml</param-value>
14:47 < jardineworks:#liferay> 	</context-param> to your web.xml and then you can use the PortalBeanLocatorUtil to get the beans out of the bean factory
14:47 < jardineworks:#liferay> but I was hoping to find a way to do it with annotations for my fellow co-workers who are spring junkies.
14:48 < jardineworks:#liferay> but I can't get the component-scan to work... and I can't find anything online. As soon as you put Liferay, Spring and Portlet together... everything is a Spring MVC portlet for Liferay, rather than a LiferayMVC portlet WITH spring :)
14:49 <@jhf:#liferay> that sounds terrible.. whatever it means ;-)
16:36 < bunbury:#liferay> hello all
16:36 < bunbury:#liferay> is liferay deployable on tomcat 8 ?
16:45 < jardineworks:#liferay> bunbury, is tomcat 8 supposed to run with java 8? (I've gotten it going on the latest version of tomcat 7, but have not tried 8)
16:45 < jardineworks:#liferay> because if tomcat 8 is supposed to be for java 8... then probably not. At least, java 8 is not officially supported by Liferay yet
16:46 -!- mode/#liferay [+o jhf] by ChanServ
16:46 < bunbury:#liferay> tomcat 8 can run with java 7
16:47 < bunbury:#liferay> the web tech is updated
16:47 < bunbury:#liferay> jsp jstl versions
16:47 < bunbury:#liferay> servlet specs
