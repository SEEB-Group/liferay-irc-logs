09:16 < d0nkeyBOB:#liferay> Has anybody had success in testing their custom services?
09:16 < d0nkeyBOB:#liferay> trying to do integration tests, but not having a good time
09:34 < jardineworks:#liferay> d0nkeyBOB, can you provide a little more detail? when you say services you mean custom service builder stuff?
09:40 < d0nkeyBOB:#liferay> correct. create a custom service and I want to run some test on the crud methods. all documentation i've seen hasn't been working
09:40 < jardineworks:#liferay> some tests as in unit tests?
09:41 < d0nkeyBOB:#liferay> correct. integration tests more likely though. just want to test that my methods read and write correctly
09:43 < d0nkeyBOB:#liferay> tried the InitUtil.initWithSpring(); examples, mockito etc. can't get a successfull add of a record. just didn't know if i'm doing it wrong
09:43 < jardineworks:#liferay> d0nkeyBOB, are your unit tests part of the same portlet plugin project?
09:43 < jardineworks:#liferay> maven or ant?
09:44 < d0nkeyBOB:#liferay> Using Maven. When I used the Liferay archetype, it creates it as a portal project
