11:15 < ech0s7:#liferay> hi all
11:15 < ech0s7:#liferay> i have implemented a custom configuration portlet, i would add a button to close the configuration panel
11:15 < ech0s7:#liferay> how can i do ?
11:30 < winem_:#liferay> hi together, I can't import the users from our ldap. testing the connection, users and groups works fine but liferay does not import them
11:31 < winem_:#liferay> so what does the import and export mean? I guess import is the import from our ldap to liferay and export the other way?
12:02 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey jhf -- you there?
12:22 <@jhf:#liferay> hey jardineworks
12:24 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf: qq for you -- I know you're a busy guy :). I have a problem where someone added a page to a site and it looks like something went whacky. Click on any of the site pages and you get a message saying  "Failed to retrieve content" -- in the log ResourceAction exception for #ADD_TO_PAGE action.
12:25 < jardineworks:#liferay> any ideas?
12:25 <@jhf:#liferay> hmm
