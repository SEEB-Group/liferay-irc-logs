11:15 < ech0s7:#liferay> hi all
11:15 < ech0s7:#liferay> i have implemented a custom configuration portlet, i would add a button to close the configuration panel
11:15 < ech0s7:#liferay> how can i do ?
11:30 < winem_:#liferay> hi together, I can't import the users from our ldap. testing the connection, users and groups works fine but liferay does not import them
11:31 < winem_:#liferay> so what does the import and export mean? I guess import is the import from our ldap to liferay and export the other way?
12:02 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey jhf -- you there?
12:22 <@jhf:#liferay> hey jardineworks
12:24 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf: qq for you -- I know you're a busy guy :). I have a problem where someone added a page to a site and it looks like something went whacky. Click on any of the site pages and you get a message saying  "Failed to retrieve content" -- in the log ResourceAction exception for #ADD_TO_PAGE action.
12:25 < jardineworks:#liferay> any ideas?
12:25 <@jhf:#liferay> hmm
12:26 <@jhf:#liferay> can you remove the page via control panel?
12:26 <@jhf:#liferay> also, what liferay version?
12:26 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf: nope -- failed to retrieve content
12:26 < jardineworks:#liferay> 6.2 EE
12:26 < jardineworks:#liferay> SP7 I think
12:26 < jardineworks:#liferay> I thought I could try deleting teh layouts via scripting panel?
12:27 <@jhf:#liferay> yep you could!
12:27 <@jhf:#liferay> but can you just go to control panel -> site pages
12:27 <@jhf:#liferay> and click on the page
12:27 <@jhf:#liferay> and click delete?
12:27 <@jhf:#liferay> you may need to choose the site via the site dropdown in control panel (at the top)
12:28 <@jhf:#liferay> then go to site pages
12:28 < jardineworks:#liferay> control panel -> site pages is the problem lol
12:28 < jardineworks:#liferay> that is where I am getting the error
12:28 < jardineworks:#liferay> and the theme these guys build removed all the page controls and dock bar (kill me)
12:29 < jardineworks:#liferay> I am trying in the control panel scripting... but this is giving me an error --
12:29 <@jhf:#liferay> oh... yeah you can also remove the page via the API. but I've never done it so it would take some investigation. shouldn't be too bad.
12:29 <@jhf:#liferay> what script are you using?
12:30 <@jhf:#liferay> I have a script I use to *add* pages via API :)
12:30 < jardineworks:#liferay> I am trying to use groovy
12:30 < jardineworks:#liferay> I have no idea though hahaha
12:30 < jardineworks:#liferay> never used this thing before
12:30 < jardineworks:#liferay> import  com.liferay.portal.service.* import com.liferay.portal.model.*  Layout layout1 = com.liferay.portal.service.LayoutLocalServiceUtil.getLayout(314407);
12:30 < jardineworks:#liferay> but it is erroring out
12:31 < jardineworks:#liferay> maybe I can change your add to a delete :)
12:31 <@jhf:#liferay> hahaha. standby. my script is actually a java program, but i can convert it to groovy..  one sec
12:43 <@jhf:#liferay> ok almost got it.. just testing.
12:43 < jardineworks:#liferay> k
12:43 < jardineworks:#liferay> :)
12:44 < jardineworks:#liferay> the weird this is tha tthe pages were created ... but the error I was getting in the runtime was this -- com.liferay.portal.NoSuchResourceActionException: collectorpdfportlet_WAR_collectorportlet#ADD_TO_PAGE
12:44 < jardineworks:#liferay> BUT!
12:44 < jardineworks:#liferay> when I checked the ResourceActions table --- the entries were there
12:44 < jardineworks:#liferay> :S
12:47 <@jhf:#liferay> so here's the script to delete it:
12:47 <@jhf:#liferay> https://gist.github.com/jamesfalkner/c69e9d809b32c1ecf9bc
12:48 <@jhf:#liferay> replace 10182 with the proper groupId, and /somepage with the friendlyUrl of the page to delete in that group
12:49 <@jhf:#liferay> does that portlet define any custom resource or resource-actions?
12:49 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf: no sir
12:49 < jardineworks:#liferay> that is waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay ahead of where we're at right now.
12:50 <@jhf:#liferay> staging in use?
12:51 <@jhf:#liferay> also I assume that portlet was actually added to the page?
12:51 <@jhf:#liferay> the collectorportlet
12:53 <@jhf:#liferay> also see https://issues.liferay.com/browse/LPS-53997
12:53 <@jhf:#liferay> sounds suspicious
12:58 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf: no staging
12:58 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf: and they say the portlet was not added yet
12:58 < jardineworks:#liferay> and I don't see it in the layout type settings
12:58 < jardineworks:#liferay> so I believe them :)
12:58 <@jhf:#liferay> did that groovy script work?
12:59 < jardineworks:#liferay> trying now
12:59 < jardineworks:#liferay> sorry... I am onsite this week and I get pulled in a THOUSAND directions when I am here
12:59 < jardineworks:#liferay> lol
12:59 <@jhf:#liferay> if it does, you should try to reproduce the issue
12:59 < jardineworks:#liferay> suck to be popular.
13:13 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf: Rquest failed to complete :(
13:13 < jardineworks:#liferay> I just choose groovy from the drop down right?
13:14 <@jhf:#liferay> yes. how about comment out the two lines of code and just put out.println("hi")
13:14 <@jhf:#liferay> to ensure it is working
13:14 <@jhf:#liferay> also I updated the gist to put semicolons after each import line. it shouldn't be needed but you never know.
13:14 <@jhf:#liferay> / you comment like this
13:14 <@jhf:#liferay> err
13:14 <@jhf:#liferay>  // you comment like this
13:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> yeah that works
13:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> oh wait
13:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> lol
13:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> multiple QA environments
13:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> I think I am on the wrong server
13:23 < jardineworks:#liferay> there we go :)
13:23 < jardineworks:#liferay> thanks jhf
13:27 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf: one more question when you have time. I feel like I have read this one somewhere before but I can't find it. Is it possible to hide/show a field in a structure based on the selection of another field in the same structure?
13:33 < jardineworks:#liferay> didn't fix the issues -- shoot
13:36 <@jhf:#liferay> I don't think dynamic hide/show structure fields is possible - it sounds awesome though.
13:38 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf: I'll put it on my list of things to try :)
13:39 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah
13:39 <@jhf:#liferay> fancy javascript in a JSP override somehow.
13:40 <@jhf:#liferay> or file a feature request and socialize the crap out of it
13:40 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf: still failing to load content... seems to be on all sites for the instance no less.
13:40 <@jhf:#liferay> if you undeploy that collector portlet does it fix it?
13:40 < jardineworks:#liferay> negative. Tried that first.
13:41 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf: do resource actions get set up dynamically? like if I drop the ResourceActions table .. or purge the content I mean, do you know if LR will put it back?
13:41 < jardineworks:#liferay> maybe I need a reboot.
13:41 < jardineworks:#liferay> JSPs... could be cached.
13:42 <@jhf:#liferay> I don't think they get set up automatically. if you undeploy the portlets then any custom resource actions you defined should be un-done
13:42 < jardineworks:#liferay> hmm
13:42 <@jhf:#liferay> I think they only get setup automatically for custom portlets
13:42 <@jhf:#liferay> system resources won't be re-grown if the table is dropped.
13:42 < jardineworks:#liferay> that didn't happen. I undepoyed the portlet and they were still there... I had to manually delete them from the table.
13:43 <@jhf:#liferay> oh..
13:43 <@jhf:#liferay> hmmmm...
13:43 < jardineworks:#liferay> maybe they're supposed to be though
13:43 < jardineworks:#liferay> could just be something all whacky right now
13:43 < jardineworks:#liferay> trying reboot with work/temp clearing.
13:44 <@jhf:#liferay> ah yes - I was wrong
13:44 <@jhf:#liferay> the are not deleted during undeploy
13:44 <@jhf:#liferay> because there might still be reousrces on the system created by that portle
13:45 <@jhf:#liferay> e.g. removing the blogs portlet (if that were possible) should not delete blog entries.
13:45 < jardineworks:#liferay> right
13:45 < jardineworks:#liferay> makes sense
13:45 < jardineworks:#liferay> wow -- the other way around could be catastrophic :)
13:45 <@jhf:#liferay> I would undeploy the portlet and remove the resource actions using the API
13:45 <@jhf:#liferay> see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19536041/removing-custom-permissions-actions-from-a-portlet/19537604
13:47 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf: but I already deleted the entries from the ResourceAction table manually :S
13:47 <@jhf:#liferay> ok
13:48 <@jhf:#liferay> so they should come back on re-deploy then
13:48 <@jhf:#liferay> ohhhhh
13:48 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah reboot!
13:48 <@jhf:#liferay> and then check DB again :)
13:48 <@jhf:#liferay> they may have not really been deleted :)
13:50 < jardineworks:#liferay> checking DB
13:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf: not in the database.
13:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> not in the ResourceAction table anyway
13:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> ah
13:52 < jardineworks:#liferay> but there are still some in the ResourcePermission table
13:53 < jardineworks:#liferay> can't see it anywhere else though
13:55 < jardineworks:#liferay> same issue
13:55 < jardineworks:#liferay> but now there is no stacktrace being thrown
16:38 < faraa:#liferay> h
16:39 < faraa:#liferay> hi
16:39 < faraa:#liferay> can anyone helps to a beginner ? ;)
17:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf: do you have a minute and a half to try something on your side? I'm not sure if I have found a bug or not.
17:49 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf: can you add these two properties to your portal-ext --
17:49 < jardineworks:#liferay> locale.prepend.friendly.url.style=2 locale.default.request=true
17:49 < jardineworks:#liferay> and then when you hit the site (using a locale other than en_US) .. can you tell me --
17:49 <@jhf:#liferay> faraa: maybe :) we shall try..
17:49 <@jhf:#liferay> jardineworks: ok one sec
17:50 < jardineworks:#liferay> a. Does the locale you have in your request header get prefixed into the URL
17:50 < jardineworks:#liferay> b. does the content appear in the correct language.
17:50 < jardineworks:#liferay> (based on the url)
17:50 <@jhf:#liferay> so you want me to reconfig my browser to send a different Accept-Language ?
17:50 <@jhf:#liferay> also you should be aware of the GUEST_LANGUAGE_ID cookie
17:52 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf: yes to the browser (I use a locale switcher in chrome)
17:52 < jardineworks:#liferay> but the guest language id cookie should not be used if the locale.default.request is set to true
17:53 <@jhf:#liferay> ok so I switched my browser to send this header: Accept-Language:fr,en-US;q=0.8,en;q=0.6
17:53 <@jhf:#liferay> and when I go to localhost:8080 it redirects me to /en
17:54 < jardineworks:#liferay> boo
17:54 <@jhf:#liferay> GUEST_LANGUAGE_ID=en_US is set in the request headers
17:54 < jardineworks:#liferay> it should send you to fr
17:54 <@jhf:#liferay> shoudl I erase all cookies for localhost?
17:54 < jardineworks:#liferay> you can give that a shot
17:54 < jardineworks:#liferay> I think I tried that
17:55 <@jhf:#liferay> ok after erasing all cookies and then re-browsing to localhost:8080 it redirects me to /fr
17:55 < jardineworks:#liferay> the other thing I noticed is that it puts the language, but not the country code. I thought it would put both... but I guess I was mistaken.
17:55 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf: I am using 6.2 EE SP10 btw
17:56 <@jhf:#liferay> ok I am on 6.2 CE GA3
17:56 <@jhf:#liferay> and it sent me to /fr that time
17:56 <@jhf:#liferay> after clearing cookies
17:56 <@jhf:#liferay> is that what you expected?
17:56 < jardineworks:#liferay> lemme try again
17:56 < jardineworks:#liferay> can yo utry with fr_CA in a locale :)
