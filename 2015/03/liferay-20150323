06:50 < winem_:#liferay> hi. is the liferay documentation wrong or am I wrong? https://www.liferay.com/documentation/liferay-portal/6.2/user-guide/-/ai/installing-liferay-on-jboss-7-4 says that I should add the mysql-*.jar to the module.xml. but this jar is not even part of the zip file
06:50 < winem_:#liferay> so I guess I can ignore this and just add the existing jars + postgresql-jdbc.jar. right?
06:51 < winem_:#liferay> sorry, I did not read the text below the box. ignore my question :D
07:08 < modd_:#liferay> is this a bug: https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/blob/master/portal-web/docroot/html/taglib/ui/input_field/page.jsp#L196 !?
07:08 < modd_:#liferay> I'm using aui:input with a model which displays a date/time
07:10 < modd_:#liferay> it works fine but whenever I load a date with a time like 20:15 it shows 08:15 (without AM/PM - I'm gettint 24h in the dropdown). it looks for me, like it doesn't get the correct ampm setting from my locale :\

10:13 < modd_:#liferay> hey jhf
10:13 < modd_:#liferay> I guess I found a new problem^^
10:13 < modd_:#liferay> <modd_> is this a bug: https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/blob/master/portal-web/docroot/html/taglib/ui/input_field/page.jsp#L196 !?

10:15 <@jhf:#liferay> hmm
10:16 < modd_:#liferay> tested with 6.2 ga2 for now
10:16 < modd_:#liferay> with ga3 I have also some strange problems
10:17 <@jhf:#liferay> this determines whether your locale is an "am-pm" locale: https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/blob/master/portal-service/src/com/liferay/portal/kernel/util/DateUtil.java#L232
10:17 <@jhf:#liferay> under which locale are you running?
10:17 <@jhf:#liferay> de_DE ?
10:17 < modd_:#liferay> yes
10:17 < modd_:#liferay> it's correct every time
10:17 < modd_:#liferay> it returns false as expected
10:17 <@jhf:#liferay> ah ok
10:22 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah I think that's a bug
10:24 <@jhf:#liferay> I bet it's "correct" in the database
10:24 <@jhf:#liferay> so probably a display bug
10:25 < modd_:#liferay> yep
10:25 < modd_:#liferay> db is correct
10:28 < modd_:#liferay> Control Panel > Portal Settings > Navigation > home URL -> in GA2 we had the value "/home", after the update to GA3 it was completely broken (new request were redirected to the last page the user was on). I had to change it to "home" without slash
11:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey jhf -- is comment moderating built into LR?
11:28 < sharmanaetor:#liferay> I was hoping someone could help me out with a question I posted on Stack Overflow: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29176864/liferay-friendly-url-field-converts-to
11:30 <@jhf:#liferay> jardineworks: yeah .. I mean via permissions/roles
11:30 <@jhf:#liferay> you could easily creaet a "Comment Moderator" role
11:30 <@jhf:#liferay> and assign people.
11:31 <@jhf:#liferay> in fact I think that might be one of the OOTB roles
11:33 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, but how do you prevent comments from being seen until they are approved?
11:33 <@jhf:#liferay> ahhh
11:34 <@jhf:#liferay> comments use the same framework as the message boards, so set up a workflow for Message Boards messages
11:34 <@jhf:#liferay> never tried it.. trying it now :0
11:34 < twen:#liferay> Hello
11:35 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf,  oh I see Control Panel > [Site] > Configuration > Workflow > Comments -- single approver.
11:35 < twen:#liferay> Has anybody the knowledge why the title of a a document & media file, is not name filename ?
11:36 < twen:#liferay> Because I like to use title as the title of the document, not it's filename :p
11:36 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, there we go... then it shows "pending approval" if you are someone who is allowed to see it
11:38 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, lol -- but now where do I go to approve it?
