02:52 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> hi there
02:57 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> we are experiencing difficulties with the social office portlet, particulary the private messaging part. We can send msg to ourselfs, but not to others people. Those who have the role "social office" appears in the "To:" list, but they don't receive anything. We must be missing something. Anyone use this portlet ?

04:17 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> hi again. I'm trying to "git clone https://github.com/liferay/liferay-plugins/tree/6.1.x/portlets/private-messaging-portlet" but got an http error in /info/refs... any ide ?
04:17 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> idea
04:41 < twen:#liferay> nicolas_FR I had big trouble yesterday cloning anything from github...
04:41 < twen:#liferay> I don't know if that's related
04:49 < twen:#liferay> nicolas_FR OH... Github has been DDOS...
06:05 < twen:#liferay> Is there a way to customize the Document & Media preview page, using the ADT ? Im trying to figure this out, but don't find a lot of reference on Google...
09:41 < jardineworks:#liferay> has anyone in here ever modified the search portlet (#3) to use filters as well?
09:41 < jardineworks:#liferay> it seems the FacetedAsset doesn't bother to do anything with the searchContext assetCategoryIds :(
