07:41 < hufg:#liferay> helloo does liferay have oob dropdown menu js/whatever component?
07:41 < hufg:#liferay> 6.2
07:42 < hufg:#liferay> oh it doesn't
10:22 < jardineworks:#liferay> put your hand up if the Importer / Exporter makes you want to hang yourself.
10:22 < jardineworks:#liferay> .o/
10:50 < ech0s7:#liferay> i have implemented a custom edit page for my portlet, extending DefaultConfigurationAction class. From edit.jsp i send a POST to controller MVCPortlet, but serveResource() is not called...why ?
11:24 < jardineworks:#liferay> ech0s7, have you specifed the correct portlet and layout ids?
11:24 < ech0s7:#liferay> yes jardineworks
11:24 < jardineworks:#liferay> can you show me the url you are using?
11:26 < jardineworks:#liferay> ech0s7, or the code you use to create the url?
11:39 < ech0s7:#liferay> jardineworks: this is a part of edit.jsp
11:39 < ech0s7:#liferay> https://dpaste.de/erur
11:41 < jardineworks:#liferay> can you view source for the page and show me the result of <%=addResUrl%>
11:43 < ech0s7:#liferay> jardineworks: https://dpaste.de/nsWV
11:44 < jardineworks:#liferay> ech0s7, can you show me your portlet class?
11:44 < jardineworks:#liferay> ech0s7, .. hmm... your URL doesn't have a plid in it. Strange. I thought that was required.
11:46 < ech0s7:#liferay> jardineworks: https://dpaste.de/exLY
11:48 < jardineworks:#liferay> do you know what the plid for your page is?
11:51 < ech0s7:#liferay> is the key of layout ?
11:51 < ech0s7:#liferay> contains the ownerid and layouid ?
11:56 < jardineworks:#liferay> ech0s7, I'm not sure what you are asking. One way to get the plid is in the render method... or if you have another porltet on that page that has an action method (and no friendly url configure) then after executing the action your url should have a plid in it.
11:57 < jardineworks:#liferay> what I was going to suggest is adding the plid=xxx to the url you trapped and just putting that in your browser to see if your logging statement shows up
11:57 < jardineworks:#liferay> if it does then you know that is what you are missing
11:58 < ech0s7:#liferay> jardineworks: the ajax POST doesn't arrives on MVCPortlet
11:58 < jardineworks:#liferay> though strange that the taglib wouldn't give that to you -- so perhaps I am mistaken
11:59 < jardineworks:#liferay> ech0s7, right -- but that may be because Liferay doesn't know where to route the request to. I think you need a Layout id in the url so that Liferay can use that plid to lookup the portlet 86 instance and then send the request to that instantiated class.
11:59 < jardineworks:#liferay> I don't normally use the resourceUrl taglib though so I am not sure. Noramlly I use Alloy Liferay.Portlet.ResourceURL
12:06 < ech0s7:#liferay> jardineworks: when i send POST
12:06 < ech0s7:#liferay> i get this error
12:06 < ech0s7:#liferay>  86 does not have any paths specified
12:07 < jardineworks:#liferay> cn you show me your portlet.xml?
12:08 < jardineworks:#liferay> incidentally, I've never seen someone use an inner class to define a custom config action :)
12:08 < jardineworks:#liferay> noramlly you have a class that extends the DefaultConfigurationAction as you have, and then configure it in your portlet.xml
12:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> but I also don't usually use AJAX for those things .. just an action method.
12:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> in fact, if you structure your actionURL corrently (with the right parameters) and name your fields prefixed with preferences-- .. lifreay will persist the stuff for you (with the DefaultConfigurationAction)
12:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> all side notes -- since that is not what you are looking to do of course :)
12:12 < ech0s7:#liferay> jardineworks: this is liferay-portlet
12:12 < ech0s7:#liferay> https://dpaste.de/EGZr
12:12 < ech0s7:#liferay> and this is portlet.xml
