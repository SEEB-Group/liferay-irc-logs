03:48 < twen:#liferay> hello
07:18 < twen:#liferay> I just found out the REST api interface... makes me happy again... I was kinda of depress by the last project and time of work suggested :-/
07:19 < hufg:#liferay> anyone had trouble with 6.2-ga2 article structure tips?
07:19 < twen:#liferay> the REST APi is quite extensive in Lifery 6.2, is it ?
07:19 < hufg:#liferay> they just don't show up

09:25 < hufg:#liferay> in 6.2 structures do you have to use localizable attribute?
09:25 < hufg:#liferay> no?
09:30 < hufg:#liferay> no.
10:06 < hufg:#liferay> i have more questionz
10:07 < jardineworks:#liferay> hufg, shoot!
10:07 < hufg:#liferay> what would be the best way to create a layout template with columns full width header, below a 50% width content area and below that a full width footer?
10:07 < hufg:#liferay> the 50% content area should be centered
10:07 < hufg:#liferay> maybe mark it with some css and margin: 0 auto; ?
10:08 < hufg:#liferay> or perhaps make redundant areas to fill for the blanks
10:08 < hufg:#liferay> i have absolutely no clue this css stuff hehe
10:08 < jardineworks:#liferay> hufg, so a layout with 3 rows .. where the middle row is 50% and centered content?
10:09 < hufg:#liferay> yes
10:09 < hufg:#liferay> the middle row is 50% of width and centered
10:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> hufg, I'm no css master but I am pretty sure the default is 100%... so you would just need, as you say a .middle { width:50% }
10:12 < hufg:#liferay> yeah i'm just over analyzing this
10:13 < hufg:#liferay> usually the full width is used
10:13 < hufg:#liferay> with smaller columns etc
10:13 < hufg:#liferay> just have to see how it goes i guess
10:13 < hufg:#liferay> also the trouble with having blank space on the layout is mobile perhaps
10:14 < hufg:#liferay> liferay handles smaller screens gracefully from the default css
10:14 < hufg:#liferay> like you have 25% 50% 25%, they will drop eventually like first comes 25% then 50% then 25%
10:15 < jardineworks:#liferay> hufg, ah -- well, this is where the rubber meets the road. It may be easier to build flat HTML with just custom css you write, but integration with liferay becomes more challenging. If however, you are able to use the Liferay css to do things like setting your widths, and layouts etc, that, from my experience, can save you a lot of pixel pushing.
10:15 < hufg:#liferay> yeah could be useful to add 25% content there just for shits and giggles to have the mobile work oob
10:16 < hufg:#liferay> dunno lets see what happens
10:19 < hufg:#liferay> this css stuff is pretty hilarious
10:19 < hufg:#liferay> like you have no vision or clue how to do things
10:19 < hufg:#liferay> :D
10:19 < hufg:#liferay> more divs! margin 0 auto! more wrapper divs!
10:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> hufg, hahah black magic!
10:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> it's like playing dice :)
10:30 < hufg:#liferay> in theory there is a css class for offsetting the column
10:31 < hufg:#liferay> Liferay 6.2 layout templates use Bootstrapâ€™s 12 column grid system: http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid
10:39 < jardineworks:#liferay> hufg, yessir
10:39 < jardineworks:#liferay> I have another page that I found where I nearly fell out of my chair. One sec...
