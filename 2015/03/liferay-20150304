06:27 < Axxell:#liferay> Dont know if anyones there but, questiontime: Is there a way for articles to automaticly populate new structure fields? ie i put in a structure in use two new boolean fields, if i would want every article to fill the default value of unfilled structure fields, is there a way to do that?
07:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey topolik or bijoo .. are either of you around for a questions?
07:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> just one actually.
07:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> :)
08:02 < jardineworks:#liferay> I have a clustered environment (EE). One of the portlets is using the MultiVMPoolUtil to get a cache object and put something in it. This cache object is nto explicitly defined in the hibernate-multi-vm-cluster.xml file, so my understanding is it uses the default cache settings and is created automagically. That all works. However, items that are placed into this cache are not being replicated in the cluster.
08:03 < jardineworks:#liferay> I enabled the ClusterBridgeMessageListener INFO level to see the chatter. If I add a page, then I see a cluste bridge message. But when I use the custom cache -- nadda.
08:03 < jardineworks:#liferay> any pointers from anyone would be appreciated.
08:05 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: hi there; I'm here now; what's going on?
08:05 < bijoo_:#liferay> Oh okay I see the question :) one sec
08:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey bijoo_ :) ... another thing I am wondering. The default cache has the properties -- properties="replicatePuts=false,replicateUpdatesViaCopy=false"
08:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> which seems weird to me. Based on ehcache documentation, I would think that these have to be TRUE to communicate changes across the cluster
08:14 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: I have to look at this later today; heading out at moment, but have questions: 1) please pastebin hibernate-multi-vm-cluster.xml, 2) please pastebin snippet of code along with context (package + classname + method where the cache is being used)
08:15 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo_:  ok -- sure, I'll paste it in here shortly
08:16 < jardineworks:#liferay> also just noticed something. The logging statement shows -- 00:20:28,913 INFO  [liferay/search_writer/SYSTEM_ENGINE-3][ClusterBridgeMessageListener:52] Bridging cluster link multicast message {destinationName=liferay/search_writer/SYSTEM_ENGINE
08:17 < jardineworks:#liferay> which makes me think that only items that are going into Lucene are actually replicating. I'm going to try removing those false properties.
08:23 < bijoo_:#liferay>   * replicatePuts=true|false - whether new elements placed in a cache are
08:23 < bijoo_:#liferay>       replicated to others. Defaults to true.
08:23 < bijoo_:#liferay>     * replicatePutsViaCopy=true|false - whether the new elements are
08:23 < bijoo_:#liferay>       copied to other caches (true), or whether a remove message is sent. Defaults to true.
08:23 < bijoo_:#liferay>     * replicateUpdates=true|false - whether new elements which override an
08:23 < bijoo_:#liferay>       element already existing with the same key are replicated. Defaults to true.
08:24 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo_: right --- saw all that, and now that I see only Lucene is replicating! ... and all the cache definitions have those set to false (why I would LOVE to know), I suspect that is the issue
08:24 < jardineworks:#liferay> trying it now...
08:24 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: http://grepcode.com/file/repo1.maven.org/maven2/net.sf.ehcache/ehcache-core/1.7.0/ehcache-failsafe.xml?av=f
08:24 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: it's since other props defaulting to true
08:25 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: the configuration is real confusing; I was faching similar issue too; though it's been several months since that time
08:26 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo_: right -- but still, all those settings are true be default, but doesn't that make sense? if you are trying to keep the nodes in sync?
08:26 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: I changed the frequency to help it ( caches *sometimes* didn't replicate well; after testing, I found 20%; by changing prop it went to 10th of that: asynchronousReplicationIntervalMillis)
08:27 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: I think it's performance tradeoff type deal; jgroup's a very chatty protocol
08:27 < jardineworks:#liferay> i suppose -- but th trade off is that you won't be in sync! lol
08:27 < jardineworks:#liferay> whcih is a problem when you have session replication enabled with round-robin proxy load :)
08:27 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: it depends on how you use cache I guess
08:28 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: I'm interested in solving this too
08:29 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: since last project we didn't have the time; to fully find the root cause of all that; so after a cycle and workaround; we just dropped it as known issue we have
08:29 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: and we switched to sticky sessions as well
08:29 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo_: so to fix the issue you modified the asychronousReplicationIntervalMillis?
08:30 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: yes, it controls how fast replication
08:30 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: try changing to 100 or something (which is 10x fast as default hz)
08:31 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo_: but in order to get the replications to go you made sure the replicate* properties were all set to true?
08:31 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: are you using multicasting for nodes?
08:31 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: if I recall, the default values worked (although I tried each single combo too)
08:32 < bijoo_:#liferay> although I tried each valid* combo too
08:34 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo_: I'm setup for unicast over TCP .. but it does work the nodes are communicating for the all the lucene stuff.
08:34 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo_: was the stuff you were caching also going into the serach index?
08:35 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: okay so unicast is more chatty; note 10x increase means 10x * number of nodes
08:35 < bijoo_:#liferay> 10x * (number of nodes - 1)
08:36 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: no I don't recall that it was, form stuff
08:36 < bijoo_:#liferay> e.g. service builder entity cols
08:37 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo_: hmm... we only have 2 nodes, so the chattyness is not much of a concern. I modified the default cache and removed the properties. So they SHOULD be using the default values now... but still not seeing the ClusterBridgeMessageListener message in the log when I put something in the cache using the MultiVMPoolUtil.
08:39 < bijoo_:#liferay> Axxell: do you mean retroactively fill them? e.g. after create the article? note can specify default structure vals
08:40 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: are the object serializable too?
08:40 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: i guess otherwise it wouldn't take it
08:41 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo_: I'm just putting a String in the cache... put("key","test");
08:45 < Axxell:#liferay> bijoo_: yup exactly what i mean!
08:46 < Axxell:#liferay> bijoo: yup exactly what i mean!
08:47 < bijoo_:#liferay> Axxell: i think have to do that through some scripting; I don't think default's added for old ones; let us know if you need help with scrippting
08:47 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: when you getCache are you doing blocking?
08:48 < Axxell:#liferay> ok, thank you, might look into it later, so ill be in touch :)
08:49 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: I'll look into it more and chat later; very interesting issue indeed :)!
08:54 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo_: just a getCache call, no blocking. but internally, that call calls the getCache( "yourname", false)
09:41 < twen:#liferay> hi
09:41 < twen:#liferay> Is there a way to give documents in Documet & Media another Document type ? Knowing I've 1700 documents to "move" :)
09:43 < bijoo_:#liferay> twen: best way is through scripting; familiar?
09:43 < bijoo_:#liferay> twen: no GUI way to do that as I know.
09:43 < twen:#liferay> well... if there is somekind of javascript I could code in liferay.. why not. I do that with Alfresco ^^
09:43 < jardineworks:#liferay> twen: you mean the mime-type?
09:43 < bijoo_:#liferay> twen: yes Javascript, Groovy, BeanShell, and more
09:44 < twen:#liferay> where can I save my "script" in liferay...
09:44 < twen:#liferay> jardineworks No.. document type.. like the Basic Document, the business document type that are biultin
09:45 < jardineworks:#liferay> twen: ah
09:45 < twen:#liferay> :)
09:46 < bijoo_:#liferay> twen: there are a couple ways to do this task; are you familiar with API?
09:46 < bijoo_:#liferay> twen: otherwise post in the forum and we'll reply (this way it's there for reference later)
09:46 < twen:#liferay> familiar with API, yes, now... I don't know what REST API exists for liferay
09:47 < bijoo_:#liferay> twen: so it's not REST, but a scripting one there: 1) login as Admin user, 2) Control Panel, 3) Server Adminstration, 4) Script
09:47 < bijoo_:#liferay> twen:  https://www.liferay.com/documentation/liferay-portal/6.1/user-guide/-/ai/running-scripts-from-the-control-panel
09:48 < jardineworks:#liferay> twen: bijoo_ ... there is a DLFileEntryType table in the database with a FileEntryTypeKey column... option to just do an update? and then trigger a reindex from the server administration section in the control panel?
09:48 < twen:#liferay> Oh ok.. I can execute directly there :) cool... However Is tere a "repositoryy where I could save scripts for later reference ?
09:49 < bijoo_:#liferay> twen: not by default but with plugin you can : http://www.liferay.com/marketplace/-/mp/application/25618082
09:49 < twen:#liferay> Ok, thanks bijoo_ for the link
09:50 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: nice, that would change for all of them correct?
09:50 < twen:#liferay> now I've to learn how to access the given Document & Medias and its files ^^
09:50 < bijoo_:#liferay> twen: do you want to change for all of them?
09:50 < bijoo_:#liferay> twen: per jardineworks you can do SQL
09:50 < bijoo_:#liferay> twen: and reindex, it may be easier
09:50 < bijoo_:#liferay> twen: so long as you're familiar with that; though I prefer the API myself; since there may be additional logic
09:50 < twen:#liferay> jardineworks PLaying directly in the database on the production server... I will not do that ^^
09:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo_: cluster question again :)... where do you place your liferay-multi-vm-clustered.xml configuration file?
09:51 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: i believe specified the location
09:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> twen: I would certainly copoy the data from prod to a separate database and try it there first ...
09:51 < twen:#liferay> now.. I only want to change the Document Type for only PDF file in this case
09:51 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: didn't have to do that in properties?
09:52 < twen:#liferay> for the API, the method called in Javascript, are exactly the same than from within Java, right ?
09:52 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo_: right now I have -- 	ehcache.multi.vm.config.location=liferay-multi-vm-clustered.xml ... and then I have placed the file in ROOT/WEB-INF/classes/META-INF
09:52 < jardineworks:#liferay> but I am getting a message at startup saying it's falling back to the failsaife version
09:53 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: ROOT/WEB-INF/classes/cache-ext/
09:53 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: ehcache.multi.vm.config.location=/cache-ext/liferay-multi-vm-clustered.xml
09:53 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: in that case you want to specify this: /META-INF/liferay-multi-vm-clustered.xml
09:54 < jardineworks:#liferay> oh jesus
09:54 < jardineworks:#liferay> of course.
09:54 < jardineworks:#liferay> duh
09:54 < bijoo_:#liferay> twen: yes exactly, the same is used here
09:54 < jardineworks:#liferay> lol
09:54 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: I had to look it up, little details ;)
09:55 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: ehcache.multi.vm.config.location.peerProviderProperties=file=cache-ext/tcp.xml
09:55 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: you have the tcp.xml I guess
09:55 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo_: yeah, but I am using ${catalina.home} for that one
09:55 < twen:#liferay> good to know :) thanks
09:55 < bijoo_:#liferay> twen: it may be easier through Groovy script; since javascript have to prepend "Packages."
09:56 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo_: I was using /ehcache/liferay-multi-vm-clustered.xml... but using jvisual VM I couldn't see my custom cache in the MBeans -- so I think it wasn't loading my config, but the default one.
09:56 < bijoo_:#liferay> twen: but do whichever you like to script more
09:56 < jardineworks:#liferay> the one from the portal-impl
09:56 < twen:#liferay> From the page, I tried the 1st example com.liferay.portal.service.UserLocalServiceUtil.getUsersCount();... it returns 11
09:56 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: okay, makes sense, good catch to double-check
09:56 < twen:#liferay> there are only 4 users
09:56 < twen:#liferay> :-/
