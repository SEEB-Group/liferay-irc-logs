06:27 < Axxell:#liferay> Dont know if anyones there but, questiontime: Is there a way for articles to automaticly populate new structure fields? ie i put in a structure in use two new boolean fields, if i would want every article to fill the default value of unfilled structure fields, is there a way to do that?
07:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey topolik or bijoo .. are either of you around for a questions?
07:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> just one actually.
07:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> :)
08:02 < jardineworks:#liferay> I have a clustered environment (EE). One of the portlets is using the MultiVMPoolUtil to get a cache object and put something in it. This cache object is nto explicitly defined in the hibernate-multi-vm-cluster.xml file, so my understanding is it uses the default cache settings and is created automagically. That all works. However, items that are placed into this cache are not being replicated in the cluster.
08:03 < jardineworks:#liferay> I enabled the ClusterBridgeMessageListener INFO level to see the chatter. If I add a page, then I see a cluste bridge message. But when I use the custom cache -- nadda.
08:03 < jardineworks:#liferay> any pointers from anyone would be appreciated.
08:05 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: hi there; I'm here now; what's going on?
08:05 < bijoo_:#liferay> Oh okay I see the question :) one sec
08:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey bijoo_ :) ... another thing I am wondering. The default cache has the properties -- properties="replicatePuts=false,replicateUpdatesViaCopy=false"
08:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> which seems weird to me. Based on ehcache documentation, I would think that these have to be TRUE to communicate changes across the cluster
08:14 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: I have to look at this later today; heading out at moment, but have questions: 1) please pastebin hibernate-multi-vm-cluster.xml, 2) please pastebin snippet of code along with context (package + classname + method where the cache is being used)
08:15 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo_:  ok -- sure, I'll paste it in here shortly
08:16 < jardineworks:#liferay> also just noticed something. The logging statement shows -- 00:20:28,913 INFO  [liferay/search_writer/SYSTEM_ENGINE-3][ClusterBridgeMessageListener:52] Bridging cluster link multicast message {destinationName=liferay/search_writer/SYSTEM_ENGINE
08:17 < jardineworks:#liferay> which makes me think that only items that are going into Lucene are actually replicating. I'm going to try removing those false properties.
08:23 < bijoo_:#liferay>   * replicatePuts=true|false - whether new elements placed in a cache are
08:23 < bijoo_:#liferay>       replicated to others. Defaults to true.
08:23 < bijoo_:#liferay>     * replicatePutsViaCopy=true|false - whether the new elements are
08:23 < bijoo_:#liferay>       copied to other caches (true), or whether a remove message is sent. Defaults to true.
08:23 < bijoo_:#liferay>     * replicateUpdates=true|false - whether new elements which override an
08:23 < bijoo_:#liferay>       element already existing with the same key are replicated. Defaults to true.
