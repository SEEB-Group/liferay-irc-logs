06:27 < Axxell:#liferay> Dont know if anyones there but, questiontime: Is there a way for articles to automaticly populate new structure fields? ie i put in a structure in use two new boolean fields, if i would want every article to fill the default value of unfilled structure fields, is there a way to do that?
07:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey topolik or bijoo .. are either of you around for a questions?
07:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> just one actually.

08:02 < jardineworks:#liferay> I have a clustered environment (EE). One of the portlets is using the MultiVMPoolUtil to get a cache object and put something in it. This cache object is nto explicitly defined in the hibernate-multi-vm-cluster.xml file, so my understanding is it uses the default cache settings and is created automagically. That all works. However, items that are placed into this cache are not being replicated in the cluster.
08:03 < jardineworks:#liferay> I enabled the ClusterBridgeMessageListener INFO level to see the chatter. If I add a page, then I see a cluste bridge message. But when I use the custom cache -- nadda.
08:03 < jardineworks:#liferay> any pointers from anyone would be appreciated.
08:05 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: hi there; I'm here now; what's going on?
