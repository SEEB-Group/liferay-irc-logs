06:20 < v01:#liferay> Hi All
06:21 < v01:#liferay> Does anyone use Liferay IDE and maven ?
08:39 < hufg:#liferay> helloo!
08:39 < hufg:#liferay> anyone know where to find different resource loaders for article templates
08:39 < hufg:#liferay> you can use #parse with some path to load different vms
09:39 < hufg:#liferay> found it
11:56 < v01:#liferay> hi
11:57 < v01:#liferay> saluton
15:36 < bijoo_:#liferay> v01: "what do you use for persistence layer in LR (service builder, hibernate, jpa, jdbc )  and why ?" -- I use ServiceBuilder
15:37 < bijoo_:#liferay> v01: because it adds caching and it's easy
15:37 < bijoo_:#liferay> v01: it reduces boilerplate code a lot
15:37 < bijoo_:#liferay> v01: and even makes remote services too
15:37 < bijoo_:#liferay> v01: service builder uses the other three itself
15:38 < bijoo_:#liferay> itself* as in it uses hibernate as well
15:38 < bijoo_:#liferay> hibernate's is a jpa impl
15:39 < bijoo_:#liferay> and jdbc is underneath that
15:40 < bijoo_:#liferay> v01: "Does anyone use Liferay IDE and maven ?" yes have used that combination in past
15:40 < jardineworks_:#liferay> bijoo_, AND! don't forget the class loader proxy magic that makes sure that your resource usage (session, connection pools, threads etc) don't go all hay wire ... all portlets using your service share the same pool instead of each making their own
15:45 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks_: good to see you! I've been so MIA ;)
15:45 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks_: yes, ditto on everything you said
15:46 < jardineworks_:#liferay> bijoo_, yeah man.. where you been hiding!? :)
15:46 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks_: some fires at my consulting day job
15:46 < jardineworks_:#liferay> ugh -- always the way
15:46 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks_: and some personal projects need some love
15:47 < jardineworks_:#liferay> personal projects?! must be nice to have that extra time ;)
15:47 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks_: anyways, not as busy as you are
15:47 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks_: and getting more sleep than you probably ;)
