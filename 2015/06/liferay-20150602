05:27 < rocknroll_:#liferay> hi all! i've got LR 6.1 GA 3 EE
05:28 < rocknroll_:#liferay> just installed IE 11 and can no longer paste anything into the editor
05:28 < rocknroll_:#liferay> when using IE that is, other browsers are fine
05:28 < rocknroll_:#liferay> I am assuming this is a CKeditor issue, right?
05:50 < timmybe:#liferay> hello
05:51 < timmybe:#liferay> can someone check if you can select a category for a user in Liferay 6.2?
06:47 < rocknroll_:#liferay> well, you can tag users
