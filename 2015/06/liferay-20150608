08:35 < scribe:#liferay> Hey guys.  Is there a way to turn off portlet dragging for admins?  My admin users often accidentally move portlets around even when they are not in 'edit' mode on the page and it is becoming annoying to have to frequently put everything back in place.
08:35 < scribe:#liferay> Can I add some javascript to the page or something to only allow portlet dragging when edit controls are turned on?
