08:35 < scribe:#liferay> Hey guys.  Is there a way to turn off portlet dragging for admins?  My admin users often accidentally move portlets around even when they are not in 'edit' mode on the page and it is becoming annoying to have to frequently put everything back in place.
08:35 < scribe:#liferay> Can I add some javascript to the page or something to only allow portlet dragging when edit controls are turned on?
08:37 < scribe:#liferay> (same goes for page rename click.  It seems like these things should be turned off when edit controls are turned off.) My admin users also regularly use our pages for the daily work.
08:38 < scribe:#liferay> And when they're not 'admining' they don't want those clicks and drags to accidentally do adminy things :)
10:28 < unknown42:#liferay> Hello, I'm setting up liferay via webinterface. I want to use ldap, but I get the message, that I could not connect to server. But I can with Apache Directory Studio. Can you help me?
10:29 < unknown42:#liferay> I'm very new to ldap
12:10 < scribe:#liferay> Hi guys.  I'm considering switching our project grouping strategy in our portal from using UserGroup to using the "Site Member" concept.  I'm having a hard time finding "Site" utilities.  How do I get a list of Sites on a portal?  I found the WebsiteLocalServiceUtil but this only seems to give me what I think are user public and private sites.
12:59 < scribe:#liferay> I think I've figured it out.  Sites seem to show up as "Groups" and not "UserGroups" and if I call GroupLocalServiceUtil.getGroups(companyId, 0, true);  I mostly get what I want.
