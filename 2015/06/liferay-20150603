07:22 < v01:#liferay> ja, genaue
08:59 < scribe:#liferay> Hello guys.  We have just recently updated our portal from Liferay 6.1 to 6.2ga4.  We're trying out the social office theme and it looks nice mostly.  I had a few questions, if anyone is awake and might have experience with 6.2ga4+SO.
09:01 < scribe:#liferay> It seems the menu on the left disappears if the browser is too narrow (or a phone is being used).  This seems to be an effect of the new responsive design of the system.  I noticed this before on the classic these, but the menu was moved to a dash-dash-dash little menu icon.  In the SO theme, I cannot find where the menu moves.  i.e., our users can't navigate from the front page if they are using a phone.
09:18 < jardineworks_:#liferay> scribe, I recently was told that the mobile menu -- the dash-dash-dash is actually called a "hamburger" menu :)
09:18 < jardineworks_:#liferay> scribe, I don't have the experience you are referring to but I would like to ask you a few questions about your upgrade if you have a few minutes
09:19 < jardineworks_:#liferay> I'm about to, possibly, take on the same upgrade.
10:24 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> hi guys! any tipp how can I do multisites with different hosts? i created 2 sites, but 1 - host.com/homepage, and second site have path host.com/web/newSite/homepage .... is it possible to change sitesURLs?
11:27 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> hi there
11:27 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> is there a way to group facets search results by Type ? > Having all Documents, then all journal entries, then.. etc.
11:38 < scribe:#liferay> jardineworks_, sure; ask away.  Sorry, I was in other windows for a while.
11:41 < scribe:#liferay> jardineworks_, we have a test server where I constantly tried the upgrade until I was finally happy with things.  I have a script to dump stuff from our live server into a tar.gz bundle, which I transfer to our test server and another script there takes as parameters a liferay.zip file and one of these backup bundles and sets the whole thing up from scratch.
11:42 < scribe:#liferay> Happy to share, but there are some things in there which you won't need pertaining to installing our custom webapp into liferay's tomcat instance.
11:43 < jardineworks_:#liferay> scribe, cool -- two features most heavily used for this instance is the DL and the WCM
11:43 < jardineworks_:#liferay> are you using those as well?
11:44 < scribe:#liferay> I guess not cuz I don't know what they are ;)
11:44 < jardineworks_:#liferay> Document Library and Web Content Management :)
11:45 < jardineworks_:#liferay> scribe, ... which features are you guys using?
11:45 < scribe:#liferay> No, I mean we have teams who build their own sites with the basic CM tools but we don't do any sort of staging or that sort of thing.  Some of them also upload files to share with each other, but that's the extent of how I think we might be using those feaures.
11:47 < scribe:#liferay> We use Liferay as mostly an OpenSocial container.  We have about 30 HTML Widgets we've built for universities researching critical editions and those widgets need an OpenSocial container to live inside.  Liferay is a great container and our gadgets get to live alongside all the other widgets in Liferay.
11:49 < scribe:#liferay> So, we're probably not taking advantage of any specific Liferay feature besides OpenSocial, and the basic Rights and Roles and User Management Liferay gives us.  It does a great job at those and also our teams have fun with the other stuff available
11:52 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> anyone ? :(
11:53 < jardineworks_:#liferay> scribe, do you guys use clustering and cache replication?
11:54 < scribe:#liferay> No.  I fear I'm mostly worthless for your questions.
11:54 < jardineworks_:#liferay> lol
11:55 < jardineworks_:#liferay> scribe, maybe easier for you to tell me what problems you encountered :)
11:55 < scribe:#liferay> At any given time we have about 15 student and researchers using our portal.  It's not high traffic.
11:56 < scribe:#liferay> Well, a few things I had to discover the hard way... looking through my script:
11:56 < scribe:#liferay> after you unzip a fresh copy of 6.2ga4, you'll want to: echo "setup.wizard.enabled=false" > liferay/portal-setup-wizard.properties
11:57 < scribe:#liferay> otherwise, Liferay tries to run the setup wizard even though you've given it an existing database which it just upgraded.
11:59 < scribe:#liferay> We had trouble with Calendar objects which were using extended character set.  Apparently these are created /converted as latin1 and we get constant charset errors from the database for some Calendar entries.
11:59 < scribe:#liferay> not sure who created the tables latin1-- if it is was 6.0, 6.1, or 6.2 or who didn't upgrade the encoding properly.
12:00 < scribe:#liferay> You'll need to enable a special mode for your password to work.
12:00 < jardineworks_:#liferay> I think we're using utf8 so we should be fine
12:01 < scribe:#liferay> passwords.encryption.algorithm.legacy=SHA
