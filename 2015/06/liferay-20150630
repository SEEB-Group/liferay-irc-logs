07:29 < haba713:#liferay> hi! how should reserve id value for a new custom entity primary key? MyEntityUtil.create(long myEntityId)
07:39 < haba713:#liferay> answering to myself: long myEntityId = CounterLocalServiceUtil.increment(MyEntity.class.getName())

11:00 < dave_k:#liferay> Hey all... I'm trying to write an Indexer, but always get an "[IndexerRegistryImpl:53] No indexer found for <myEntity>" error. I try to follow https://dev.liferay.com/develop/learning-paths/mvc/-/knowledge_base/6-2/enabling-search-and-indexing-for-guestbook-entries, but using Maven while splitting service and portlet into different projects. How can I debug this?
15:11 < bijoo_:#liferay> jhf: excited about RH+LR
15:12 < bijoo_:#liferay> jhf: and need to start checking out M6 too
15:12 < bijoo_:#liferay> ditto on all that jardineworks works too
15:15 <@jhf:#liferay> \o/
15:15 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah I know te community leads at redhat so we're gonna do some joint stuff
15:15 <@jhf:#liferay> hmm.. that didn't sound right
15:16 < bijoo_:#liferay> jhf: lol
15:29 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah please take a crack at M6
15:30 <@jhf:#liferay> I found some issues and wondering if others are seeing it
16:10 < bijoo_:#liferay> jhf: as note, working with an RH expert; he's working RH since year 2000; he says most of all he likes their culture; and how knoweldgeable folks are friendly
16:10 < bijoo_:#liferay> so sounds a lot like the Liferay culture
16:11 < bijoo_:#liferay> jhf: I'll see if I can spare M6 cycle
16:11 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah! I got a good vibe last week at the RH summit
16:11 < bijoo_:#liferay> jhf: too busy for my own good at these days
16:11 <@jhf:#liferay> reminded me of the good days @ Sun micro
16:11 < bijoo_:#liferay> jhf: nod
