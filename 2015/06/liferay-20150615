05:42 < ikb:#liferay> is there something like search container but without table display?
06:00 < scribe:#liferay> Hi guys.  I'm still having some difficulty retrieving all the members of a site.
06:00 < scribe:#liferay> Any suggestions would be appreciated.
06:01 < scribe:#liferay> What I am doing is this:  I can use Liferay.ThemeDisplay.getScopeGroupId() to get the group id for the site.
06:02 < scribe:#liferay> Then on my backend, I'm using: UserLocalServiceUtil.getGroupUsers(groupId)
