08:32 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> how can i disable XML-entity encode in URL for AUI.css and MAIN.css ????
11:29 < scribe:#liferay> Hi guys!  We have a user we are trying to convert from using their wordpress blog to use our project's Liferay sites blogging facilities.  We're having a couple problems converting him and I'm looking for help :)
11:29 < scribe:#liferay> One thing Ive done is put a blog aggregator on our front page.  This is a cool feature he doesn't have on his wordpress blog
11:30 < scribe:#liferay> But... There is no subscribe button.  Is there a way to add a subscribe button to the blog aggregator gadget?  It is our project's blog and we want our users to be able to subscribe to our project's blog.
11:33 < scribe:#liferay> Secondly, he wants the ability for people to subscribe to his blog without being forced to create an account.  Apparently wordpress does this by simply allowing a user to enter their email address to subscribe to the blog.
11:33 < scribe:#liferay> Is there a feature like this for Liferay?
