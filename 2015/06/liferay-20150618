09:37 < hufg:#liferay> hello!
09:37 < hufg:#liferay> i'm trying to make another portal instance but if i'm logged in as omniuser can't access the pages
09:37 < hufg:#liferay> huh?
09:38 < hufg:#liferay>  com.liferay.portal.NoSuchResourcePermissionException: No ResourcePermission exists with the key {companyId=20552, name=com.liferay.portal.model.Layout, scope=4, primKey=20581, roleId=20164}
10:03 < jardineworks:#liferay> hufg, are you one on the main instance? or on the newly created instance?
10:05 < hufg:#liferay> newly created
10:08 < dave_k:#liferay> A coworker created a Liferay Service using a String as Primary Key. Now I have to enable its entities to be used as an asset. Is my hunch correct that if want to call assetEntryLocalService.updateEntry(), the classPK argument must be the PrimaryKey used in service.xml? And because of the method signature, PrimaryKeys have to be of type long? And that I have to restructure the whole Service?
10:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> hufg, but you created the NEW instance from the main instance, correct?
10:09 < hufg:#liferay> yes
10:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> hufg, which version are you on?
10:09 < hufg:#liferay> latest 6.2 ee sp11
10:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> hufg, ok cool... I have that one too.
10:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> hufg, and then when you try to log into your new instance, you get that error?
10:09 < hufg:#liferay> hmm well
10:10 < hufg:#liferay> the thing is it's an external env somewhere
10:11 < hufg:#liferay> i create the portal by logging through the public http address
10:11 < hufg:#liferay> then the first thing i did was to create another instance, i use the public http address as instance virtualhost
10:11 < hufg:#liferay> this is everything with the first user omniadmin
