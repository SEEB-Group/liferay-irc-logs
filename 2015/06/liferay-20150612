03:28 < bodik:#liferay> hi, i have trouble with rss portlet, somehow it cannot display 2 of 20 feeds we have configured. ther's no log or anything which might suggest what is wrong, any idea how to debug that portlet ?
03:30 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> morning guys
03:31 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> permissions for this 2x feeds?
03:31 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> or wrong structur
03:31 < [ru|de|en]CyberK:#liferay> or publisching date
03:32 < bodik:#liferay> http://isc.sans.edu/rssfeed.xml cannot be found.
03:35 < bodik:#liferay> which is wierd, there's no exception in logs, and "cannot be found" is not really informative because that feed is working
04:03 < bodik:#liferay> [ru|de|en]CyberK: i cannt see what is wrong with that feed ;(
04:03 < bodik:#liferay> [ru|de|en]CyberK: is there any chance to debug a portlet ?
