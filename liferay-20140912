10:35 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> hi there
10:36 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> I would like to see https://issues.liferay.com/browse/LPS-23481 correction code, so I can report it on our 6.1.2 CE (as it seems it was only corrected for 6.2CE and 6.1.11 EE)

14:47 < stefkos:#liferay> hey
14:48 < stefkos:#liferay> just launched Liferay IDE ..but it doesnt respond
14:48 < stefkos:#liferay> I even added more memory, restarted
14:48 < stefkos:#liferay> java takes around 80%cpu and nothing is going on
14:48 < stefkos:#liferay> any idea?
14:48 < jardineworks_:#liferay> what OS?
14:48 < stefkos:#liferay> windows
14:48 < stefkos:#liferay> heya jardineworks
14:48 < jardineworks_:#liferay> ew
14:49 < jardineworks_:#liferay> ;)
14:49 < jardineworks_:#liferay> hmm
14:49 < stefkos:#liferay> its project from yesterday
14:49 < stefkos:#liferay> :) thats why I hate java and Eclipse:)
14:49 < jardineworks_:#liferay> I've never actually used Liferay IDE... I usually just use the update site and add the plugins to a stock eclipse installation
14:50 < stefkos:#liferay> -Xms40m
14:50 < stefkos:#liferay> -Xmx1024m
14:50 < jardineworks_:#liferay> do you have any eclipses you can try (without Liferay plugins?)
14:50 < jardineworks_:#liferay> how much memory do you have on your machine?
14:50 < stefkos:#liferay> 8G
14:51 < jardineworks_:#liferay> try setting Xms and Xmx to the same -- save the JVM trying to grab more on the fly
14:51 < jardineworks_:#liferay> and set your PermGen to 256
14:54 < stefkos:#liferay> just set to 1024...but have similar issue ( task manager says it grab around 460MB)
14:55 < stefkos:#liferay> -PermGen
14:55 < stefkos:#liferay> 256m  ?
14:55 < jardineworks_:#liferay> I think its -XX:PermGen
14:56 < jardineworks_:#liferay> -XX:MaxPermSize=384m
14:56 < jardineworks_:#liferay> or in your case -- 256
14:56 < stefkos:#liferay> ok just set...lets try
14:57 < jardineworks_:#liferay> i doubt it will change anything but you never know
14:57 < stefkos:#liferay> looks similar, but I will wait a moment
14:57 < stefkos:#liferay> maybe I should remove liferay server fe?
14:58 < jardineworks_:#liferay> what's your memory usage look like?
14:58 < jardineworks_:#liferay> maxed out?
14:58 < stefkos:#liferay> nope
14:58 < stefkos:#liferay> at least 5 GB free
14:58 < jardineworks_:#liferay> hmm
14:58 < jardineworks_:#liferay> have you tried rebooting?
14:58 < jardineworks_:#liferay> :)
14:59 < stefkos:#liferay> yep:)
14:59 < jardineworks_:#liferay> it is WINBLOWS after all
14:59 < jardineworks_:#liferay> hmmm
14:59 < jardineworks_:#liferay> do you have another eclipse (sans-liferay) you can try?
14:59 < stefkos:#liferay> another eclipse should work
14:59 < stefkos:#liferay> at least netbeans was working
15:00 < stefkos:#liferay> here "process is not responding'
15:00 < stefkos:#liferay> but cpu usage is different
