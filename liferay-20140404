06:48 < Axxell:#liferay> PLEASE HELP: ive got a server with liferay 6.2 and been adding childpages under a page, ive added about 15 or so pages, and now when i add more pages, they do not appear in the list. Seems like there might be som kind of limit how many pages can be shown
06:48 < Axxell:#liferay> Can anybody confirm this?
06:49 < Axxell:#liferay> yup putting some of the
06:49 < Axxell:#liferay> pages as child pages to pages
06:50 < modd_:#liferay> hi jhf, sorry to bother you...did you test that portlet? was it reproducible?
06:51 <@jhf:#liferay> nope, sorry, haven't had a chance to test it this week.. did you happen to file a ticket for that issue?
06:52 < Axxell:#liferay> makes the added pages which were not visible before visible again
06:52 < Axxell:#liferay> so somebody has made a big no-no.. hard coded maxnumber of childpages
06:52 < Axxell:#liferay> visible under site pages?
06:52 < Axxell:#liferay> can anybody suggest a fix?
06:54 < modd_:#liferay> jhf: nope, no ticket. I'm really not sure if it's my problem or liferays, because I can't find anything related on google etc., as if I'm the only one
06:55 <@jhf:#liferay> ok.. is this on 6.2 or 6.1?
06:55 < modd_:#liferay> 6.2
