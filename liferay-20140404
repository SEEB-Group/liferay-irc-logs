06:48 < Axxell:#liferay> PLEASE HELP: ive got a server with liferay 6.2 and been adding childpages under a page, ive added about 15 or so pages, and now when i add more pages, they do not appear in the list. Seems like there might be som kind of limit how many pages can be shown
06:48 < Axxell:#liferay> Can anybody confirm this?
06:49 < Axxell:#liferay> yup putting some of the
06:49 < Axxell:#liferay> pages as child pages to pages
06:50 < modd_:#liferay> hi jhf, sorry to bother you...did you test that portlet? was it reproducible?
06:51 <@jhf:#liferay> nope, sorry, haven't had a chance to test it this week.. did you happen to file a ticket for that issue?
06:52 < Axxell:#liferay> makes the added pages which were not visible before visible again
06:52 < Axxell:#liferay> so somebody has made a big no-no.. hard coded maxnumber of childpages
06:52 < Axxell:#liferay> visible under site pages?
06:52 < Axxell:#liferay> can anybody suggest a fix?
06:54 < modd_:#liferay> jhf: nope, no ticket. I'm really not sure if it's my problem or liferays, because I can't find anything related on google etc., as if I'm the only one
06:55 <@jhf:#liferay> ok.. is this on 6.2 or 6.1?
06:55 < modd_:#liferay> 6.2
06:55 < modd_:#liferay> tested on CE
06:55 < modd_:#liferay> the portlet is also build with 6.2 sdk
06:56 < modd_:#liferay> I guess it will fail on EE, too, if it's a liferay problem
06:58 <@jhf:#liferay> ok so the problem is you can't retrieve localization strings from Liferay's collection of localizations, from your configuration jsp (whereas the same works from "normal" jsp) ?
06:59 < modd_:#liferay> in the view jsp by using the liferay ui message tag I'll get the value for the key
06:59 < modd_:#liferay> but in the controller class it doesn't work
06:59 < Axxell:#liferay> looking at the html the "site pages" page outputs, there is a "load more results" link but its invisible
07:00 < modd_:#liferay> If I add these keyvalue pairs to the portal Language_xx.properties, it will also work in the controller
07:01 <@jhf:#liferay> so are you interested in retrieving your own custom localizations, from your own properties files,  from your controller class? or are you interested in re-using LIferay's localization strings?
07:02 < modd_:#liferay> I need to get a localized string out of the portlets language files
07:02 <@jhf:#liferay> ok
07:02 < modd_:#liferay> like it's done in the view jsp
07:02 <@jhf:#liferay> trying your sample ..
07:03 < modd_:#liferay> I need these values in the controller because I have another portlet which makes use of the new notifications-portlet and sending the text to it so a user get's a notification, can click on it and will see the localized string
07:04 <@jhf:#liferay> yes. I think I know what the problem is. one sec. I ran into this a couple of years ago.
07:04 < modd_:#liferay> my current workaround is a hook for the portal language_xx.properties files and adding all my portlet related keyvalue into it
07:07 < Axxell:#liferay> apparently this is a known bug...
07:07 <@jhf:#liferay> I believe the fix is here: http://www.marconapolitano.it/en/liferay/32-text-localization-in-a-custom-portlet.html
07:08 <@jhf:#liferay> I think you need to use the LanguageUtil.* methods that take a PortletConfig
07:09 <@jhf:#liferay> such as http://docs.liferay.com/portal/6.2/javadocs/com/liferay/portal/kernel/language/LanguageUtil.html#format(javax.portlet.PortletConfig, java.util.Locale, java.lang.String, java.lang.Object)
07:09 <@jhf:#liferay> whoops that link broke
