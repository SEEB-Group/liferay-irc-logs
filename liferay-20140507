03:58 < alex______> Gooday!
04:01 < alex______> Is there a way to move some Vocabularies and their Categories from Global to a specific site without re-creating them ?
05:47 < alex______> Is there a way to move some Vocabularies and their Categories from Global to a specific site without re-creating them ?
08:14 < topolik> alex______: I believe it could be possible on the DB level - change groupId of the records, but be careful to move whole tree
08:14 < topolik> Then you need to flush Liferay DB cache / restart portal
08:33 < alex______> topolik: Thanks for your answer but, isnt that risky? I dont know what to change, which table and if there are any dependancies that will get.... .... damaged!
08:47 < modd_> hi topolik. do you know why I'm getting queueing foo-portlet for deploy because it is missing marketplace-portlet for everthing on startup and how I can add another portlet to the same list as marketplace-portlet?
08:50 < topolik> alex______: Yes, it could be a bit risky. Portal doesn't have any such functionality so it's up to you. If you would like to copy it, you could try export/import
08:51 < topolik> modd_: hi, that means your foo-portlet depends on marketplace-portlet and you need to deploy marketplace portlet
08:51 < modd_> yes but why? I didn't add it to the list of required things
08:52 < topolik> modd_: it's written in foo-portlet's liferay-plugin-package.properties
08:52 < modd_> nope it's not, that's the poin
08:52 < modd_> t
08:52 < topolik> can you paste here the message pleasea?
08:53 < modd_> e.g.:
08:53 < modd_> 12:42:52,773 INFO  [localhost-startStop-1][HotDeployEvent:130] Plugin Language_de-hook requires marketplace-portlet 12:42:52,773 INFO  [localhost-startStop-1][HotDeployImpl:249] Queueing Language_de-hook for deploy because it is missing marketplace-portlet
08:53 < modd_> after it deploys the marketplace-portlet it works just fine
08:53 < modd_> but I didn't add the marketplace-portlet to the list
08:54 < modd_> so liferay does some magic here
08:59 < topolik> uhm
09:00 < topolik> seems it's something new in 6.2 - https://issues.liferay.com/browse/LPS-39277
09:01 < modd_> looks like I can't add another portlet to the list in any easy way
09:01 < topolik> which list?
09:01 < modd_> ..of portlets, which are always required
09:01 < modd_> I need sol4-web to load as one of the first
09:01 < modd_> solrr4-web*
09:02 < modd_> damn..^^
09:02 < modd_> solr4*
