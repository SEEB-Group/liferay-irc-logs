03:58 < alex______> Gooday!
04:01 < alex______> Is there a way to move some Vocabularies and their Categories from Global to a specific site without re-creating them ?
05:47 < alex______> Is there a way to move some Vocabularies and their Categories from Global to a specific site without re-creating them ?
08:14 < topolik> alex______: I believe it could be possible on the DB level - change groupId of the records, but be careful to move whole tree
08:14 < topolik> Then you need to flush Liferay DB cache / restart portal
08:33 < alex______> topolik: Thanks for your answer but, isnt that risky? I dont know what to change, which table and if there are any dependancies that will get.... .... damaged!
08:47 < modd_> hi topolik. do you know why I'm getting queueing foo-portlet for deploy because it is missing marketplace-portlet for everthing on startup and how I can add another portlet to the same list as marketplace-portlet?
08:50 < topolik> alex______: Yes, it could be a bit risky. Portal doesn't have any such functionality so it's up to you. If you would like to copy it, you could try export/import
08:51 < topolik> modd_: hi, that means your foo-portlet depends on marketplace-portlet and you need to deploy marketplace portlet
08:51 < modd_> yes but why? I didn't add it to the list of required things
08:52 < topolik> modd_: it's written in foo-portlet's liferay-plugin-package.properties
08:52 < modd_> nope it's not, that's the poin
08:52 < modd_> t
08:52 < topolik> can you paste here the message pleasea?
08:53 < modd_> e.g.:
08:53 < modd_> 12:42:52,773 INFO  [localhost-startStop-1][HotDeployEvent:130] Plugin Language_de-hook requires marketplace-portlet 12:42:52,773 INFO  [localhost-startStop-1][HotDeployImpl:249] Queueing Language_de-hook for deploy because it is missing marketplace-portlet
08:53 < modd_> after it deploys the marketplace-portlet it works just fine
08:53 < modd_> but I didn't add the marketplace-portlet to the list
08:54 < modd_> so liferay does some magic here
08:59 < topolik> uhm
09:00 < topolik> seems it's something new in 6.2 - https://issues.liferay.com/browse/LPS-39277
09:01 < modd_> looks like I can't add another portlet to the list in any easy way
09:01 < topolik> which list?
09:01 < modd_> ..of portlets, which are always required
09:01 < modd_> I need sol4-web to load as one of the first
09:01 < modd_> solrr4-web*
09:02 < modd_> damn..^^
09:02 < modd_> solr4*
09:03 < topolik> you should be able to create tomcat/webapps/ROOT/WEB-INF/classes/dependencies/plugins2/wars.txt
09:04 < topolik> well, in fact, if you don't need marketplace-portlet, you can overwrite plugins1/wars.txt and leave it empty
09:05 < modd_> I don't care about marketplace-portlet, I just want to add another portlet ;)
09:09 < modd_> it's maybe worth a try, even if it's an ext I need here
09:09 < modd_> thx topolik! :)
09:09 < topolik> another way could be to make a dependency tree
09:10 < topolik> and position all your plugins inside :)
09:12 < modd_> dependency tree?
10:07 < alex______> does anyone know why every time I post a new document, instead of emailing  my users, I keep getting a: [SubscriptionSerncer:472] com.liferay.portal.NoSuchRespositoryEntryException  ????
12:40 < bijoo_> alex______: paste the whole stack trace to pastebin.com; then post the URL in room here
13:18 < jardineworks> topolik, are you around (and still awake)?
13:22 < topolik> hi jardineworks, partially
13:23 < topolik> good to see you again
13:34 < jardineworks> topolik, ! \o/
13:34 < jardineworks> you too man
13:34 < jardineworks> I've been on a bit of a break trying to build something else... a house hahaha
13:35 < jardineworks> but
13:35 < jardineworks> I am also getting back in the game and have a puzzle for search if you have a second?
13:35 < jardineworks> Using the lucene OOTB engine i know in 6.0 < you could do some query behaviour using the portal-ext file.
13:36 < jardineworks> in 6.1 is seems like all the search configuration stuff is moved to a search-spring.xml file.
13:36 < jardineworks> All I want to do is change the default behaviour to use AND inplace of OR for keywords
13:36 < jardineworks> I read the the KeywordAnalyzer is the way to do it... do you know if that is still the case?
13:36 < jardineworks> or is there an easier way?
13:59 < npskirk> Does anyone know if there's a way to capture and log all attempted requests the portal receives?  Namely, when the portal reports something like
13:59 < npskirk> 17:18:29,652 ERROR [http-bio-8080-exec-9][JSONWebServiceServiceAction:114] java.lang.RuntimeException: No JSON web service action associated with path /egs-portlet.gamebot and method POST for /
13:59 < npskirk> java.lang.RuntimeException: No JSON web service action associated with path /egs-portlet.gamebot and method POST for /
13:59 < npskirk> I'd like to know more about the post
13:59 < npskirk> like what the body contained
14:45 < topolik> jardineworks: I'm sorry I know nothing about it :/
14:54 < topolik> npskirk: try https://ngrok.com/ Beside the tunnelling it has local web UI where you can inspect all requests
14:55 < npskirk> Hey that looks pretty cool â€” thanks for the pointer!
15:45 < bradley> where is documentation for PPG Pacl Policy Generator?
15:45 < bradley> I need to generate pacl settings for my theme inorder to sell it on marketplace
15:50 < bradley> nevermind I found it
15:50 < bradley> https://www.liferay.com/documentation/liferay-portal/6.1/development/-/ai/lp-6-1-dgen11-developing-plugins-with-security-in-mind-0
18:24 < bijoo_> npskirk: also httpd with logging
