03:58 < alex______> Gooday!
04:01 < alex______> Is there a way to move some Vocabularies and their Categories from Global to a specific site without re-creating them ?

08:14 < topolik> alex______: I believe it could be possible on the DB level - change groupId of the records, but be careful to move whole tree
08:14 < topolik> Then you need to flush Liferay DB cache / restart portal
08:33 < alex______> topolik: Thanks for your answer but, isnt that risky? I dont know what to change, which table and if there are any dependancies that will get.... .... damaged!
08:47 < modd_> hi topolik. do you know why I'm getting queueing foo-portlet for deploy because it is missing marketplace-portlet for everthing on startup and how I can add another portlet to the same list as marketplace-portlet?
08:50 < topolik> alex______: Yes, it could be a bit risky. Portal doesn't have any such functionality so it's up to you. If you would like to copy it, you could try export/import
08:51 < topolik> modd_: hi, that means your foo-portlet depends on marketplace-portlet and you need to deploy marketplace portlet
08:51 < modd_> yes but why? I didn't add it to the list of required things
08:52 < topolik> modd_: it's written in foo-portlet's liferay-plugin-package.properties
