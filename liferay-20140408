05:25 < wohnout:#liferay> Hi all, I have proprietary SSO service from liferay to external apps. I'm trying to redirect to external app after successful login. Everything works great except that I need to open portal once before the login is propagated to external app
05:25 < wohnout:#liferay> do you have any advice what to call to "start" session

07:13 < modd_:#liferay> hi. as far as I see here https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/blob/master/definitions/liferay-workflow-definition_6_2_0.xsd the onTimer execution type is not available at all, or did I miss something?
07:48 < itman:#liferay> Hi guys
07:49 < itman:#liferay> can someone help me connect ruby 2.0 with liferay 6.1
07:51 < itman:#liferay> I can't found google unfortunatly
08:02 < wohnout:#liferay> Is somehow possible to trigger login.events.post when using CustomLoginAction?
08:10 < modd_:#liferay> does PropsUtil not work?
08:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> wohnout, What do you mean trigger? if it is configured in the portal-ext then it should fire
08:18 < wohnout:#liferay> Well I'm redirecting to external application upon login but if I use redirect parameter then there is no call to Main Servlet so the login.events.post is not triggered.
08:21 < modd_:#liferay> read the value of this property in your custom action and create and call the class by hand
08:23 < wohnout:#liferay> modd_: that PropsUtil was on me ? :)
08:23 < wohnout:#liferay> that PropsUtil answer
08:25 < modd_:#liferay> I thought you are were asking how to get the value of the property...sry
08:25 < modd_:#liferay> -
08:25 < modd_:#liferay> *
