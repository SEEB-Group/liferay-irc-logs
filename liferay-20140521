08:56 < sl33k> hey guys
08:56 < sl33k> i'm picking of liferay after a long break...how to get started? which liferay+tomcat should i use, etc etc
08:58 < aj_> sl33k, if you are loooking for the latest stable, 6.2
08:59 < sl33k> aj_: also got some questions...
08:59 < sl33k> i) has to do with how to share common codebase across portlets without recopying, also common services/features
08:59 < aj_> fire away... you might not get an answer immediately, but people are pretty good about answering in this channel
08:59 < sl33k> aj_: e.g a typical hibernate listener
09:01 < sl33k> i usually also like to setup my project has maven etc
09:03 < aj_> support for maven in 6.2 is solid -- I haven't used it myself but I have a few clients that do and they said its much better than previous incarnations.
09:03 < aj_> brb
09:04 < jardineworks> topolik, have you ever done anything with the scheduling stuff?
09:04 < topolik> jardineworks: yes, but it was like 5yrs ago
09:05 < jardineworks> topolik, I'll tell you what I am doing this time and maybe an old lightbulb will go off :)
09:05 < topolik> ok :)
09:08 < jardineworks> just gonna grab a coffee... bbiam
09:08 < sl33k> even though i have used mostly tomcat+liferay in past, i want to see jboss+lifery this time around
09:08 < sl33k> ^_^
09:08 < sl33k> hope its a good bet
09:15 < jardineworks> sl33k, I'm not a jboss fan to be honest and I have never used anything in my liferay work that warrants it over Tomcat.
09:16 < jardineworks> topolik, gonna PM you for the sensitive stuff, then we can chat in here for all the loggers and such :)
