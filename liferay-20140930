03:45 < goku_:#liferay> hi, in the struts action override processAction method after calling the  originalStrutsPortletAction.processAction() method how to get the newly created user ID?
04:33 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> hi there
04:49 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> hi there
04:51 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> seems we encounter a problem with L6.1.2 and configuration portlet. We have jquery loaded from Theme (jQuery v1.11.1) and some configuration page with some jquery magic. Fact is, on L6.1.2 GA3 (we were on L5.2.3 before), the configuration page says our jQuery is undefined (not loaded from theme I bet). It occurs before theme loads the jQuery, because if I enter JS console, I can see my jQuery vars... but not at the time the con
05:21 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> So I'm wondering, is there another place to load my javascript library + custom js, if not in theme ?
05:41 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> Javascript loading problem with configuration pages. Should we still load our JS in the theme, or directly (by hook) in the top_js-ext page ?
09:41 < jardineworks_:#liferay> goku_, is you action being called?
09:42 < goku_:#liferay> yea its working and the processAction is gettting called
09:44 < jardineworks_:#liferay> so in your process action method, the first thing you do is call the originalstrutsaction right?
09:44 < goku_:#liferay> jardineworks_, in that method the after  originalStrutsPortletAction.processAction(originalStrutsPortletAction, portletConfig, actionRequest, actionResponse); i think the original action is executed after this ,i am trying to get the newly created userid
09:44 < jardineworks_:#liferay> goku_, show me your action method
09:53 < goku_:#liferay> jardineworks_,http://pastebin.com/i5sdfvE9
09:56 < jardineworks_:#liferay> goku_, ah
09:56 < jardineworks_:#liferay> goku_, I see your problem.
09:56 < jardineworks_:#liferay> hmmm
09:56 < jardineworks_:#liferay> goku_, is it a new user or an existing user that you are working with?
09:59 < jardineworks_:#liferay> goku_, Let's assume for a moment that it's a new user.
10:00 < jardineworks_:#liferay> actually, it doesn't matter.
10:00 < jardineworks_:#liferay> You have the email address right?
10:00 < goku_:#liferay> jardineworks_, yea
10:00 < jardineworks_:#liferay> the originalStrutsAction call will create the user. When you come back from that call, you can do a UserLocalServiceUtil.getUserByEmail...
