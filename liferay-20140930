03:45 < goku_:#liferay> hi, in the struts action override processAction method after calling the  originalStrutsPortletAction.processAction() method how to get the newly created user ID?
04:33 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> hi there
04:49 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> hi there
04:51 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> seems we encounter a problem with L6.1.2 and configuration portlet. We have jquery loaded from Theme (jQuery v1.11.1) and some configuration page with some jquery magic. Fact is, on L6.1.2 GA3 (we were on L5.2.3 before), the configuration page says our jQuery is undefined (not loaded from theme I bet). It occurs before theme loads the jQuery, because if I enter JS console, I can see my jQuery vars... but not at the time the con
05:21 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> So I'm wondering, is there another place to load my javascript library + custom js, if not in theme ?
05:41 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> Javascript loading problem with configuration pages. Should we still load our JS in the theme, or directly (by hook) in the top_js-ext page ?
09:41 < jardineworks_:#liferay> goku_, is you action being called?
09:42 < goku_:#liferay> yea its working and the processAction is gettting called
09:44 < jardineworks_:#liferay> so in your process action method, the first thing you do is call the originalstrutsaction right?
09:44 < goku_:#liferay> jardineworks_, in that method the after  originalStrutsPortletAction.processAction(originalStrutsPortletAction, portletConfig, actionRequest, actionResponse); i think the original action is executed after this ,i am trying to get the newly created userid
09:44 < jardineworks_:#liferay> goku_, show me your action method
09:53 < goku_:#liferay> jardineworks_,http://pastebin.com/i5sdfvE9
09:56 < jardineworks_:#liferay> goku_, ah
09:56 < jardineworks_:#liferay> goku_, I see your problem.
09:56 < jardineworks_:#liferay> hmmm
09:56 < jardineworks_:#liferay> goku_, is it a new user or an existing user that you are working with?
09:59 < jardineworks_:#liferay> goku_, Let's assume for a moment that it's a new user.
10:00 < jardineworks_:#liferay> actually, it doesn't matter.
10:00 < jardineworks_:#liferay> You have the email address right?
10:00 < goku_:#liferay> jardineworks_, yea
10:00 < jardineworks_:#liferay> the originalStrutsAction call will create the user. When you come back from that call, you can do a UserLocalServiceUtil.getUserByEmail...
10:00 < jardineworks_:#liferay> that will give you the user that was just added.
10:01 < goku_:#liferay> jardineworks_, ohk
10:01 < jardineworks_:#liferay> The only thing I am not sure about -- does the originalStrutsACtion actually return to your hook? or does it redirect to another place?
10:01 < goku_:#liferay> jardineworks_, thanks man
10:02 < jardineworks_:#liferay> np
10:03 < jardineworks_:#liferay> these are my favourite puzzles to solve :)
10:04 < goku_:#liferay> jardineworks_, nice  hobby :)
10:08 < jardineworks_:#liferay> goku_, for me it is an important concept to grasp when working with Liferay to be honest. So many of my clients spend some much of their money and time "recreating" functionality when 90% of what they need is already in the portal. One of the strengths of Liferay, I think, is the fact that you can do stuff like what you are doing. Most vendors have 452 "settings" that manipulate the dozen of so permutations they have determin
10:08 < jardineworks_:#liferay> ed to be "what everyone important needs" ... Liferay provides the lego blacks.
10:08 < jardineworks_:#liferay> just one of the many reasons I <3 Liferay
10:09 < jardineworks_:#liferay> and I am always trying to show my clients the real benefits of the platform from this perspective.
10:10 < jardineworks_:#liferay> The only real downside is that hooks are "global" .. but I just use a little trick to allow you to configure then for a "portal instance"
10:11 < goku_:#liferay> jardineworks_, oh ok
10:11 < jardineworks_:#liferay> hold on -- I'll share the code with you
10:13 < goku_:#liferay> jardineworks_, it i will configure that in my setup
10:15 < jardineworks_:#liferay> goku_, what's the package/classname for your custom action?
