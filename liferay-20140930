03:45 < goku_:#liferay> hi, in the struts action override processAction method after calling the  originalStrutsPortletAction.processAction() method how to get the newly created user ID?
04:33 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> hi there
04:49 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> hi there
04:51 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> seems we encounter a problem with L6.1.2 and configuration portlet. We have jquery loaded from Theme (jQuery v1.11.1) and some configuration page with some jquery magic. Fact is, on L6.1.2 GA3 (we were on L5.2.3 before), the configuration page says our jQuery is undefined (not loaded from theme I bet). It occurs before theme loads the jQuery, because if I enter JS console, I can see my jQuery vars... but not at the time the con
05:21 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> So I'm wondering, is there another place to load my javascript library + custom js, if not in theme ?
05:41 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> Javascript loading problem with configuration pages. Should we still load our JS in the theme, or directly (by hook) in the top_js-ext page ?
09:41 < jardineworks_:#liferay> goku_, is you action being called?
09:42 < goku_:#liferay> yea its working and the processAction is gettting called
09:44 < jardineworks_:#liferay> so in your process action method, the first thing you do is call the originalstrutsaction right?
09:44 < goku_:#liferay> jardineworks_, in that method the after  originalStrutsPortletAction.processAction(originalStrutsPortletAction, portletConfig, actionRequest, actionResponse); i think the original action is executed after this ,i am trying to get the newly created userid
09:44 < jardineworks_:#liferay> goku_, show me your action method
09:53 < goku_:#liferay> jardineworks_,http://pastebin.com/i5sdfvE9
09:56 < jardineworks_:#liferay> goku_, ah
09:56 < jardineworks_:#liferay> goku_, I see your problem.
09:56 < jardineworks_:#liferay> hmmm
09:56 < jardineworks_:#liferay> goku_, is it a new user or an existing user that you are working with?
09:59 < jardineworks_:#liferay> goku_, Let's assume for a moment that it's a new user.
10:00 < jardineworks_:#liferay> actually, it doesn't matter.
10:00 < jardineworks_:#liferay> You have the email address right?
10:00 < goku_:#liferay> jardineworks_, yea
10:00 < jardineworks_:#liferay> the originalStrutsAction call will create the user. When you come back from that call, you can do a UserLocalServiceUtil.getUserByEmail...
10:00 < jardineworks_:#liferay> that will give you the user that was just added.
10:01 < goku_:#liferay> jardineworks_, ohk
10:01 < jardineworks_:#liferay> The only thing I am not sure about -- does the originalStrutsACtion actually return to your hook? or does it redirect to another place?
10:01 < goku_:#liferay> jardineworks_, thanks man
10:02 < jardineworks_:#liferay> np
10:03 < jardineworks_:#liferay> these are my favourite puzzles to solve :)
10:04 < goku_:#liferay> jardineworks_, nice  hobby :)
10:08 < jardineworks_:#liferay> goku_, for me it is an important concept to grasp when working with Liferay to be honest. So many of my clients spend some much of their money and time "recreating" functionality when 90% of what they need is already in the portal. One of the strengths of Liferay, I think, is the fact that you can do stuff like what you are doing. Most vendors have 452 "settings" that manipulate the dozen of so permutations they have determin
10:08 < jardineworks_:#liferay> ed to be "what everyone important needs" ... Liferay provides the lego blacks.
10:08 < jardineworks_:#liferay> just one of the many reasons I <3 Liferay
10:09 < jardineworks_:#liferay> and I am always trying to show my clients the real benefits of the platform from this perspective.
10:10 < jardineworks_:#liferay> The only real downside is that hooks are "global" .. but I just use a little trick to allow you to configure then for a "portal instance"
10:11 < goku_:#liferay> jardineworks_, oh ok
10:11 < jardineworks_:#liferay> hold on -- I'll share the code with you
10:13 < goku_:#liferay> jardineworks_, it i will configure that in my setup
10:15 < jardineworks_:#liferay> goku_, what's the package/classname for your custom action?
10:16 < goku_:#liferay> jardineworks_, com.talco.reg.user.field UserFieldStrutsPortletAction
10:17 < jardineworks_:#liferay> ok so, if you use this class... http://pastebin.com/C1WwGXV1
10:18 < jardineworks_:#liferay> then in your UserFieldStrutsPortletAction class ... wrap the process action logic in a conditional that uses the util.
10:18 < jardineworks_:#liferay> and then in your portal-ext
10:18 < jardineworks_:#liferay> com.talco.reg.user.field UserFieldStrutsPortletAction.hook=<companyid>
10:19 < jardineworks_:#liferay> if you create a second instance later, and still have the hook deployed, it's absence from the property setting means that it will not be executed.
10:20 < jardineworks_:#liferay> it doesn't save the overhead of making calls "unecessarily" ... but it does allow you to leave the customized logic set for a particular "company"
10:20 < jardineworks_:#liferay> or portal instance.
10:29 < goku_:#liferay> jardineworks_, ok :)
10:34 < jardineworks_:#liferay> goku_, forgot to mention... you would want this class globally available so you should have it in its own jar in the TOMCAT_HOME/lib/ext
10:34 < jardineworks_:#liferay> I normally create a <client_name>-liferay-commons.jar for my projects for such classes.
10:38 < goku_:#liferay> jardineworks_, do you know why this beanlocator not found error is coming for the service jar which i put into the lib/ext folder
10:41 < jardineworks_:#liferay> goku_, service jar as in a custom jar that resulted from a service builder project?
10:44 < goku_:#liferay> jardineworks_, yes
10:45 < jardineworks_:#liferay> goku_, do you still have the jar as part of your service builder portlet that is deployed?
10:46 < jardineworks_:#liferay> sometimes I have seen this sort of message when there is a conflict. If you put it in the global libs then you should remove it from the plugin lib folders to make sure that there is just one "master" reference.
10:46 < jardineworks_:#liferay> ... and you restarted the server after moving it to /lib/ext right? :)
10:47 < goku_:#liferay> i haven't deployed the service portlet, yea i have restarted it
10:50 < jardineworks_:#liferay> goku_, hmm... can you show me the entire stacktrace?
10:51 < goku_:#liferay> jardineworks_, ok
14:15 < douglascrp:#liferay> hey guys
14:15 < douglascrp:#liferay> this is my first time here
14:15 < jardineworks_:#liferay> welcome
14:15 < douglascrp:#liferay> jardineworks_, thank you
14:15 < douglascrp:#liferay> I'm trying to learn liferay now, and i'm following the service builder tutorial
14:16 < jardineworks_:#liferay> good start -- service builder is what made me fall in love with LR :)
14:16 < jardineworks_:#liferay> initially.
14:16 < douglascrp:#liferay> I've adapted the eventlisting portlet sample to my case, but after I create a register using the form, I got no registers on the database
14:17 < douglascrp:#liferay> everything seems to be working ok, no erros, no alerts, no nothing... only the message saying that the operation is ok
14:17 < douglascrp:#liferay> jardineworks_, really? lol
14:17 < douglascrp:#liferay> why initially? don't you like it anymore?
14:17 < douglascrp:#liferay> I'm an alfresco guy... liferay is all new to me
14:18 < jardineworks_:#liferay> on the contrary ... I just have a million more things that I discovered that make me love it even more than service builder ever did :)
14:18 < douglascrp:#liferay> nice
14:18 < jardineworks_:#liferay> douglascrp, lemme see your portlet.xml file.
14:18 < jardineworks_:#liferay> (use pastie or something)
14:18 < douglascrp:#liferay> I'll have to work a lot with liferay from now, so I hope I can learn enough to work and to be able to help people
14:18 < douglascrp:#liferay> sure
14:19 < douglascrp:#liferay> jardineworks_, may I send my full project to you?
14:19 < douglascrp:#liferay> can you provide me your email in private?
14:20 < jardineworks_:#liferay> sure
14:20 < jardineworks_:#liferay> which version of LR? 6.2 CE I assume?
14:23 < douglascrp:#liferay> jardineworks_, it's should be in your inbox now
14:23 < douglascrp:#liferay> 6.2 CE
14:23 < douglascrp:#liferay> I've sent the project to you... it's a maven project
14:23 < jardineworks_:#liferay> ew
14:23 < douglascrp:#liferay> I'm trying to use which I think is the best combination
