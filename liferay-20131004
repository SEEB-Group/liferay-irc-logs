04:29 < hufg:#liferay> anyway to access velocity variables sset in theme in article templates
04:29 < hufg:#liferay> ?
04:56 < rocknroll_:#liferay> i'd like to know why i cant seem to override javascript files in my hook
06:12 < hufg:#liferay> what are you trying to override
06:14 < rocknroll_:#liferay> /html/portlet/journal/js/main.js
06:16 < hufg:#liferay> <!ELEMENT hook (portal-properties?, language-properties*, custom-jsp-dir?, custom-jsp-global?, indexer-post-processor*, service*, servlet-filter*, servlet-filter-mapping*, struts-action*)>
06:17 < hufg:#liferay> not seeing custom-js-dir :Z
06:17 < hufg:#liferay> maybe it can be done but just saying from the dtd it doesn't imply that you can override js
06:18 < hufg:#liferay> though user guide says it can
06:19 < hufg:#liferay> i'd use a working jsp hook as a template
06:22 < rocknroll_:#liferay> my jsp:s are overridden just fine
06:22 < rocknroll_:#liferay> and i know it's been done, at least people are claiming that they have done it
06:24 < hufg:#liferay> mm yeah
06:31 < hufg:#liferay> what hook configuration are you using?
06:31 < hufg:#liferay> in liferay-hook.xml
06:31 < hufg:#liferay> just out of curiousity
06:32 < hufg:#liferay> does the custom-jsp-dir work for whatever files defined in that path
06:32 < rocknroll_:#liferay> https://www.liferay.com/community/forums/-/message_boards/message/30130915
06:57 < hufg:#liferay> yeah but since none of the hook xml element names are descriptive enough which one did you choose?
06:58 < hufg:#liferay> custom-jsp-dir is the best guess
06:58 < hufg:#liferay> i guess? 8))
06:59 < rocknroll_:#liferay> well yes, jsp files are workign
06:59 < rocknroll_:#liferay> just not the js
07:04 < hufg:#liferay> works fine :/
07:04 < hufg:#liferay> you have the wrong path
07:08 < hufg:#liferay> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/b11acab0f517896cf87b
07:19 < rocknroll_:#liferay> aha
07:30 < hufg:#liferay> "thanks mate" :)
07:30 < hufg:#liferay> liferay may also fail not just the hook
07:30 < hufg:#liferay> or you hehe
07:31 < hufg:#liferay> it's not unheard of that liferay bails on you on some feature
07:35 < rocknroll_:#liferay> sry, major network issues. but the directory is not the issue
07:35 < rocknroll_:#liferay> this is journal specific js
07:36 < rocknroll_:#liferay> and my files are in custom_jsps
07:36 < rocknroll_:#liferay> all jsp files work, just not the javascript
07:39 < hufg:#liferay> 8/
07:41 < hufg:#liferay> gist liferay-hook.xml and tree project structure !
10:17 < hufg:#liferay> helloo helloo after which filter can i access request webkeys attributes
10:39 < hufg:#liferay> ah its in servicepreaction
10:41 < hufg:#liferay> my hook is doomed
10:51 < hufg:#liferay> dooooomed
