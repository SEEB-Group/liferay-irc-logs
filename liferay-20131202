05:53 < Axxell:#liferay> hey guys, been trying to do a "classic" theme with liferay 6.2. Now theres a problem, when the menu is collapsed, ie made to a button for small resolution devices, the menu show/hide functionality of that button does not work, ie nothing happens when you push that button, the menu is hidden thou
05:54 < Axxell:#liferay> can figure out what is causing that.. tried looking at the css but nopes
06:06 < Axxell:#liferay> can they really have managed to make a broken "_styled" theme for liferay 6.2?
06:14 < hufg:#liferay> helloo helloo

08:55 < hufg:#liferay> anyone tried browserstack?
10:07 < aj_:#liferay> hufg -- you there?
10:41 < hufg:#liferay> yees
10:41 < hufg:#liferay> still here
10:41 < aj_:#liferay> \o/
10:41 < aj_:#liferay> ny chance that you have ever done anything in the Managed Pages with passing query strings?
10:41 < aj_:#liferay> I have a top level category that has several children
10:41 < aj_:#liferay> the child pages should all go to the parent page, but pass a parameter to do an implied search
10:42 < aj_:#liferay> I have set the children to "Link to Page" .. picked the parent, and then under advacned set the query parameter to be category=[name]
10:42 < aj_:#liferay> but all I ever get is a null when I try to pull it out of the request, httprequest or the originalhttprequeest
10:44 < hufg:#liferay> mm no i havent
10:44 < hufg:#liferay> what does the request look like?
10:45 < aj_:#liferay> there is a query string but is has just two parameters in it
10:46 < hufg:#liferay> should be fairly straightforward as long as liferay adds the query param
10:46 < aj_:#liferay> I haven't had time to creawl through the layout code to see where it is supposed to be added...
10:46 < hufg:#liferay> imo key=value as normal get param should work as expected
10:46 < aj_:#liferay> yeah, I suspect that this is eaiter a bug (doubtful) or I am violating some rule.
10:46 < aj_:#liferay> ok -- I was just wondering if you had used it. Thanks anyway
10:46 < hufg:#liferay> np np
10:52 < hufg:#liferay> hehe tried it quickly
10:53 < hufg:#liferay> can't see any params anywhere
10:53 < hufg:#liferay> :(
10:53 < hufg:#liferay> firebugs net is very handy for quick header inspection
10:57 < aj_:#liferay> yeah -- i even tried stepping through with a debugger
10:58 < aj_:#liferay> I thought maybe it had to be a public render parameter... but that didn't work either
10:58 < aj_:#liferay> no one is complinign about it and I DOUBT I am the only person on 6.1.1 trying to use it lol
11:00 < aj_:#liferay> rotty3000, are you around?
11:17 < bjornjohansson__:#liferay> Hello guys! :)
11:17 < bjornjohansson__:#liferay> Is there an easy way to convert several portlets into one single portlet project in Eclipse?
11:22 < aj_:#liferay> bjornjohansson__, other than copy and paste? I don't think so
11:22 < bjornjohansson__:#liferay> ouch :)
11:26 < aj_:#liferay> its not THAT bad
11:27 < aj_:#liferay> unless you have a million portlets :)

15:59 < aj_:#liferay> topolik!
15:59 < aj_:#liferay> help!
15:59 < aj_:#liferay> I have a crazy issue right now and no idea how to even look at it
16:00 < aj_:#liferay> If I have any missing resources on my page .. for example an image reference that is missing (say a bad url) ... then the server is REPEATING the request
16:00 < aj_:#liferay> its terrible from a performance perspective but its much worse than that on pages where I have submitted an action ... the action is firing multiple times.
16:01 < aj_:#liferay> So doing things like adding an item to a cart is happening multiple times.
16:01 < aj_:#liferay> jhf, rotty3000 I would love any insight you guy have as well.
16:01 < aj_:#liferay> we were baffled by the behaviour but one of the guys on my team said this happened to him once before. We fixed the broken images and then the behaviour returned to normal
16:02 < aj_:#liferay> but the issue is we need this to be soemthing that doesn't occur because otherwise, if our client makes a mistake, it could wreak havoc on the site.
16:21 < aj_:#liferay> !!!!
16:22 < aj_:#liferay> I think I found the cause.
16:22 < aj_:#liferay> if I don't set the currentURL then it happens. If I set it .. for any of the portlets on the page... then it doesn't repeat itself
