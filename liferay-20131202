05:53 < Axxell:#liferay> hey guys, been trying to do a "classic" theme with liferay 6.2. Now theres a problem, when the menu is collapsed, ie made to a button for small resolution devices, the menu show/hide functionality of that button does not work, ie nothing happens when you push that button, the menu is hidden thou
05:54 < Axxell:#liferay> can figure out what is causing that.. tried looking at the css but nopes
06:06 < Axxell:#liferay> can they really have managed to make a broken "_styled" theme for liferay 6.2?
06:14 < hufg:#liferay> helloo helloo

08:55 < hufg:#liferay> anyone tried browserstack?
10:07 < aj_:#liferay> hufg -- you there?
10:41 < hufg:#liferay> yees
10:41 < hufg:#liferay> still here
10:41 < aj_:#liferay> \o/
10:41 < aj_:#liferay> ny chance that you have ever done anything in the Managed Pages with passing query strings?
10:41 < aj_:#liferay> I have a top level category that has several children
10:41 < aj_:#liferay> the child pages should all go to the parent page, but pass a parameter to do an implied search
10:42 < aj_:#liferay> I have set the children to "Link to Page" .. picked the parent, and then under advacned set the query parameter to be category=[name]
10:42 < aj_:#liferay> but all I ever get is a null when I try to pull it out of the request, httprequest or the originalhttprequeest
10:44 < hufg:#liferay> mm no i havent
10:44 < hufg:#liferay> what does the request look like?
10:45 < aj_:#liferay> there is a query string but is has just two parameters in it
10:46 < hufg:#liferay> should be fairly straightforward as long as liferay adds the query param
10:46 < aj_:#liferay> I haven't had time to creawl through the layout code to see where it is supposed to be added...
10:46 < hufg:#liferay> imo key=value as normal get param should work as expected
10:46 < aj_:#liferay> yeah, I suspect that this is eaiter a bug (doubtful) or I am violating some rule.
10:46 < aj_:#liferay> ok -- I was just wondering if you had used it. Thanks anyway
10:46 < hufg:#liferay> np np
10:52 < hufg:#liferay> hehe tried it quickly
10:53 < hufg:#liferay> can't see any params anywhere
10:53 < hufg:#liferay> :(
10:53 < hufg:#liferay> firebugs net is very handy for quick header inspection
10:57 < aj_:#liferay> yeah -- i even tried stepping through with a debugger
10:58 < aj_:#liferay> I thought maybe it had to be a public render parameter... but that didn't work either
10:58 < aj_:#liferay> no one is complinign about it and I DOUBT I am the only person on 6.1.1 trying to use it lol
11:00 < aj_:#liferay> rotty3000, are you around?
11:17 < bjornjohansson__:#liferay> Hello guys! :)
11:17 < bjornjohansson__:#liferay> Is there an easy way to convert several portlets into one single portlet project in Eclipse?
11:22 < aj_:#liferay> bjornjohansson__, other than copy and paste? I don't think so
11:22 < bjornjohansson__:#liferay> ouch :)
11:26 < aj_:#liferay> its not THAT bad
11:27 < aj_:#liferay> unless you have a million portlets :)
