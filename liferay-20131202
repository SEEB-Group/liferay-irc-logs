05:53 < Axxell:#liferay> hey guys, been trying to do a "classic" theme with liferay 6.2. Now theres a problem, when the menu is collapsed, ie made to a button for small resolution devices, the menu show/hide functionality of that button does not work, ie nothing happens when you push that button, the menu is hidden thou
05:54 < Axxell:#liferay> can figure out what is causing that.. tried looking at the css but nopes
06:06 < Axxell:#liferay> can they really have managed to make a broken "_styled" theme for liferay 6.2?
06:14 < hufg:#liferay> helloo helloo
