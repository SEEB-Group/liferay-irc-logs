01:53 < rocknrol1_> hey all. trying to set up NTLM auth
01:53 < rocknrol1_> getting stringindexoutofbounds after login
01:54 < rocknrol1_> rather, out of range: -1
05:22 < modd_> hey topolik. I've got the page-subpage url stuff done, now I'm doing the same thing for sites-subsites...
06:36 < bosua> this channel really quiet
07:18 < modd_> does someone know how liferay gets the friendlyURL for creating the links? it does not use grouplocalserviceimpl methods :\
09:38 < topolik> modd_: look at PortalImpl
09:39 < modd_> I had to manipulate the group model impl
09:39 < modd_> it works so far but I have some issues with my delimiter, which I've added between sites and pages in the url
09:40 < modd_> some sepcial cases I have to solve
09:40 < modd_> special*

15:27 < Guest36660> Hi All, is anyone here active or is this a dead channel?
15:39 < modd> it's not dead
15:39 < modd> but not always alive
15:43 < Guest36660> Quite true
15:43 < Guest36660> Are you alive?
16:10 < jardineworks> Guest36660, did you need help with something? ... though Friday at 4pm isn't usually the best time to start soliciting assistance :)
16:10 < jardineworks> especially on a long weekend in the US
16:10 < Guest36660> Yeah I know. =(
16:11 < Guest36660> I dont suppose you have experience in heavily customizing Liferay do you?
16:12 < modd> what is "heavily"..I've EXTed so many classes, I can't even count^^
16:14 < Guest36660> Well my question really is pretty simple. I was just hoping someone here is a powerhouse. *hi modd*
16:14 < modd> just ask, maybe I can help, maybe not, maybe someone else can
16:15 < bijoo_> Guest36660: "don't ask to ask, just ask" is the motto
16:15 < Guest36660> Im trying to make a custom login page. Ive read around and there are various ways to do this. What do you recommend?
16:15 < jardineworks> Guest36660, why do you need a custom login page? is it to change the way it looks?
16:16 < Guest36660> In the portal_normal.ftl theres the $theme.include{content.include} line which puts all the portlets below.
16:16 < Guest36660> But its even putting portlets that I dont want there, calendar, mail, etc.
16:16 < Guest36660> jardineworks, essentially yes. Think along the lines of dropbox's login page.
16:16 < bijoo_> Guest36660: that's probably since those are on the page
16:17 < jardineworks> Guest36660, JSP override for the page and change it to look however you want.
16:17 < Guest36660> a hook?
16:17 < modd> yes
16:17 < jardineworks> for example -- https://www.sprouts.com/home?p_p_id=58&p_p_lifecycle=0&p_p_state=maximized&p_p_mode=view&saveLastPath=0&_58_struts_action=%2Flogin%2Flogin
16:17 < jardineworks> that is the standard login page manages through a JSP hook and the theme.
16:18 < Guest36660> thats a liferay site?
16:18 < jardineworks> yes
16:18 < Guest36660> nice work.
16:18 < jardineworks> thanks
16:18 < Guest36660> any place you recommend to learn more about creating hooks?
16:18 < Guest36660> <--beginner with liferay
16:18 < jardineworks> the internet :)
16:18 < jardineworks> lol
16:19 < Guest36660> oh cmon! =P
16:19 < modd> internet is pretty good, at least I heard so^^
16:19 < bijoo_> Guest36660: you can Google "create hook liferay"'s fine :)
16:19 < jardineworks> seriously... just google Liferay JSP hook and there are a million examples. If you are using Liferay IDE or the plugins for eclipse it is even easier.
16:20 < Guest36660> okay, but does the jsp hook use any templates? otherwise Id be better off passing this task to the j2ee devs.
16:20 < Guest36660> im just the frontend guy
16:21 < modd> with liferay you have to be I-do-everything-so-it-finally-works guy
16:21 < jardineworks> Guest36660, it's mixed ... so if you just want to do styling then you can leave the java code alone and just modify the HTML around it.
16:22 < Guest36660> I'd love to just do the styling/modding the templates but the portal_normal.ftl page is displaying the "left over" portlets from the user after sign out.
16:22 < Guest36660> Im not sure how to get rid of that.
16:23 < bijoo_> Guest36660: another way is to edit the theme; e.g. have a modal login form there; but if you want to have full-screen, not best.
16:23 < Guest36660> And I want to add classes to the sign in form. Which I'm not sure where it is.
16:23 < jardineworks> you have to log in as the admin, go to the page and remove the unwanted portlets.
16:23 < jardineworks> sign in form = jsp hook,
16:23 < Guest36660> Do you know of any examples for a sign in form = jsp hook?
16:24 < jardineworks> Guest36660, it's just creating a regular old jsp hook and picking the login.jsp
16:26 < Guest36660> <--- does not know jsp.
16:26 < Guest36660> or j2ee rather
16:27 < jardineworks> since all you want to change is the styling, you don't need to.
16:27 < modd> jsp is like extended html. you can put your default stuff around the existing things
16:27 < jardineworks> though I should add that NORMALLY... with this type of work, I have a front end guy deliver to me the HTML and I will make the JSP changes.
16:28 < jardineworks> so basically, they give me a "static" site... and I will pull it apart and place it into the portlets, jsp hooks, theme, etc.
