07:18 < modd_> does someone know how liferay gets the friendlyURL for creating the links? it does not use grouplocalserviceimpl methods :\

15:43 < Guest36660> Quite true
15:43 < Guest36660> Are you alive?
16:10 < jardineworks> Guest36660, did you need help with something? ... though Friday at 4pm isn't usually the best time to start soliciting assistance :)
16:10 < jardineworks> especially on a long weekend in the US
16:10 < Guest36660> Yeah I know. =(
16:11 < Guest36660> I dont suppose you have experience in heavily customizing Liferay do you?
16:12 < modd> what is "heavily"..I've EXTed so many classes, I can't even count^^
16:14 < Guest36660> Well my question really is pretty simple. I was just hoping someone here is a powerhouse. *hi modd*
16:14 < modd> just ask, maybe I can help, maybe not, maybe someone else can
