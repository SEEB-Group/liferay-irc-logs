15:21 < bijoo_:#liferay> Lots of branches in Liferay Portal git:  "temp-13" "temp-test-14-[...]"...
15:21 < bijoo_:#liferay> Are these temporary or meant to be?
15:21 < bijoo_:#liferay> I guess from name they are temporary; but weird that this is state at the moment
15:22 <@jhf:#liferay> hmmm
15:22 <@jhf:#liferay> that is weird
15:22 <@jhf:#liferay> probably some automated script that is out of control...
15:23 <@jhf:#liferay> finding out.. stay tuned.
15:23 < bijoo_:#liferay> jhf: okay, looking at one for example: "temp-13" the reference is fe9cbb828127127e85f4b4ba1010fe6f306ace03 which is by Brian Chan Sept 3rd 2014 "LPS-49541 Rename"
15:34 <@jhf:#liferay> hey bijoo_ confirmed it's an automated test thingy - one of the QA team is working on cleaning it up. so ignore for now :)
15:34 <@jhf:#liferay> hopefully it doesn't cause lots of performance loss when cloning/syncing branches
16:06 < jardineworks_:#liferay> jhf, Portal Instances seem a bit buggy.
16:06 <@jhf:#liferay> nope, it's not bugs, it's features
16:06 <@jhf:#liferay> which feature are you referring to? :)
16:07 < jardineworks_:#liferay> jhf, ... I am trying to write a build guide and every time I add a new instance I get an error because plugin defined tables are missing from the shard.
16:07 < jardineworks_:#liferay> I suppose I should say the SHARDing is buggy :)
16:08 <@jhf:#liferay> hmm
16:08 <@jhf:#liferay> did you try "Verify database tables of all plugins" (on control panel -> server administration) ?
16:08 <@jhf:#liferay> (just reading https://www.liferay.com/community/forums/-/message_boards/message/35674541)
16:09 < jardineworks_:#liferay> did not... lemme do that
16:09 < jardineworks_:#liferay> didn't even know that existed!
16:10 < jardineworks_:#liferay> I'll add that as a "pre instance creation step"
16:11 < jardineworks_:#liferay> thanks jhf :)
16:11 <@jhf:#liferay> did it "do the trick"
16:11 <@jhf:#liferay> also, I don't think that should be needed, but maybe it is
16:14 < jardineworks_:#liferay> I think it did. Alternatively, what I have been doing is redeploying the plugins
16:14 < jardineworks_:#liferay> but based on the log output -- that "magic button" seems to validate the tables and stuff.
