05:06 < rrapozo:#liferay> Hello again someone understand how I can handle the 403 error in liferay
05:06 < rrapozo:#liferay> ?
06:14 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> hi there
06:16 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> problem with migration : we had a layout defined in a theme, and now this layout has its own project (so its own .war). Even if we rename the id and the name of the layout the same in the liferay-layout-templates.xml file, it seems Liferay can't understand it's the same layout, and thus won't apply this layout to our pages which had it before the migration. Any idea ?
07:58 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> anyone there ?
09:06 < jardineworks:#liferay> rrapozo, no luck with what we were trying yesterday? Did you ever figure out what that "intermediate" page was?
09:07 < jardineworks:#liferay> rrapozo, could you make a screen cast showing the error and share it with me so I can see what you see?
09:42 < modd_:#liferay> jardineworks: am I right, that you have to do the lr certification, too?
09:47 < jardineworks:#liferay> modd_, yessir
09:47 < jardineworks:#liferay> it's on my "to-do" list :)
09:47 < jardineworks:#liferay> but that list is long.
09:48 < modd_:#liferay> it's quite hard
09:48 < modd_:#liferay> did it today
09:48 < jardineworks:#liferay> modd_, which one did you do?
09:50 < jardineworks:#liferay> modd_, ... guessing one of the developer ones?
09:50 < modd_:#liferay> yes
09:50 < jardineworks:#liferay> the level 1?
09:50 < modd_:#liferay> portal developer
09:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> do you find out immediately whether or not you passeD?
09:51 < modd_:#liferay> ...no idea, I don't see any level here
09:51 < modd_:#liferay> yes, you see it on the screen when you finish the exam
09:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> modd_, did you pass? :)
