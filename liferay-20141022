05:06 < rrapozo:#liferay> Hello again someone understand how I can handle the 403 error in liferay
05:06 < rrapozo:#liferay> ?
06:14 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> hi there
06:16 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> problem with migration : we had a layout defined in a theme, and now this layout has its own project (so its own .war). Even if we rename the id and the name of the layout the same in the liferay-layout-templates.xml file, it seems Liferay can't understand it's the same layout, and thus won't apply this layout to our pages which had it before the migration. Any idea ?
07:58 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> anyone there ?
09:06 < jardineworks:#liferay> rrapozo, no luck with what we were trying yesterday? Did you ever figure out what that "intermediate" page was?
09:07 < jardineworks:#liferay> rrapozo, could you make a screen cast showing the error and share it with me so I can see what you see?
09:42 < modd_:#liferay> jardineworks: am I right, that you have to do the lr certification, too?
09:47 < jardineworks:#liferay> modd_, yessir
09:47 < jardineworks:#liferay> it's on my "to-do" list :)
09:47 < jardineworks:#liferay> but that list is long.
09:48 < modd_:#liferay> it's quite hard
09:48 < modd_:#liferay> did it today
09:48 < jardineworks:#liferay> modd_, which one did you do?
09:50 < jardineworks:#liferay> modd_, ... guessing one of the developer ones?
09:50 < modd_:#liferay> yes
09:50 < jardineworks:#liferay> the level 1?
09:50 < modd_:#liferay> portal developer
09:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> do you find out immediately whether or not you passeD?
09:51 < modd_:#liferay> ...no idea, I don't see any level here
09:51 < modd_:#liferay> yes, you see it on the screen when you finish the exam
09:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> modd_, did you pass? :)
09:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> Once the audience is selected, the appropriate mastery level can be selected. In order of progression, the mastery levels are:
09:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> Liferay Certified Associate
09:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> Liferay Certified Professional
09:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> Liferay Certified Expert
09:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> The candidate must begin at the first level available (e.g., Liferay Certified Associate) for that certification before moving to the next level (e.g., Liferay Certified Professional). For the developer certification, the first level available is Liferay Certified Professional.
09:51 < modd_:#liferay> yes
09:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> \o/
09:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> EHF
09:52 < jardineworks:#liferay> (EHF => Electronic High Five)
09:52 < jardineworks:#liferay> modd_, where are you located again?
09:53 < modd_:#liferay> a lot of questions are nonsense...like you have to learn the whole API to know all methods in all service classes
09:53 < modd_:#liferay> germany
09:57 < modd_:#liferay> anyway, good luck for your exam, I'm out ;)
10:48 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> problem with migration : we had a layout defined in a theme, and now this layout has its own project (so its own .war).

15:00 < urug_:#liferay> In structure template I need to create an url to certain page, I can obtain layout object for that page, group object, but I don't have an access to request object (or anything containing it like themeDisplay) so I can't create the portal part of the url
15:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> urug_, I thought the $request was in the template scope, no?
15:02 < jardineworks:#liferay> urug_, what did you see last night whne you used JHF's variable dumper?
15:05 < urug_:#liferay> there is an array "request", I can access some information like this ${request['server-name']}, it should also contain variable $request['theme-display'], but it's definately not ThemeDisplay object
15:07 < jardineworks:#liferay> hmmm
15:07 < urug_:#liferay> maybe it could be possible to do samething like ${request['server-name']}:${request['server-port']}${portal.getPathFriendlyURLPublic()}${group.getFriendlyURL()}bookOrderLayout.getFriendlyURL(locale)
15:08 < urug_:#liferay> port the port number might be a problem
15:08 < urug_:#liferay> and it's super ugly
15:12 < urug_:#liferay> maybe i got it: ${request['theme-display']['url-portal']}
15:14 < urug_:#liferay> the request variable is basically array-ized request object
15:14 < urug_:#liferay> more or less
15:14 < jardineworks:#liferay> yep -- it was the same in velocity
15:19 < urug_:#liferay> btw have you seen the way how to access these reserved variables in FM? ... ${.vars['reserved-article-id'].data}
15:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> urug_, are you askign or telling me?
15:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> because if you are telling... WOW
15:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> that is gross
15:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> :)
15:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> ${reserved-article['id']} would be so much nicer
15:22 < urug_:#liferay> telling
15:22 < jardineworks:#liferay> yikes
15:22 < jardineworks:#liferay> .vars
15:22 < jardineworks:#liferay> :|
15:22 < jardineworks:#liferay> unix geek stuff :)
15:24 < urug_:#liferay> it wouldn't be such a problem if it would be mentioned somewhere in documentation
15:25 < jardineworks:#liferay> haha
15:25 < jardineworks:#liferay> urug_, maybe you should update that wiki page :)
15:29 < urug_:#liferay> so instad of portalUtil.getLayoutFriendlyURL(layout, themeDisplay, locale), i need  this
15:30 < urug_:#liferay> request['theme-display']['url-portal']+portal.getPathFriendlyURLPublic()+group.getFriendlyURL()+bookOrderLayout.getFriendlyURL(locale)
15:30 < jardineworks:#liferay> lemme try to telnet
15:30 < jardineworks:#liferay> or
15:30 < jardineworks:#liferay> let me write my messages in the correct window
15:30 < jardineworks:#liferay> :S
15:34 < urug_:#liferay> ?
