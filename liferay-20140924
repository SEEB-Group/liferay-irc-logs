04:08 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> hello htere
04:16 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> I would like to find the properties of the breadcrumbs porlets that I can modify in my velocity template so I can deploy this portlet from my theme with the good configuration. Any doc ?
05:12 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> I'm trying to create a hook (L6.1.2 GA3) to change "breadcrumb.display.style.options". I do the hook and get a src/main/resources/portal.properties file, but this doesn't work. But if I put it in my ROOT/WEB-INF/.../portal-ext.properties, there we go. What am I doing wrong in my hook ?

09:13 < jardineworks_:#liferay> nicolas_FR, the portal.properties is the place to put it -- did you also include the liferay-hook.xml config in the WEB-INF location to tell it about the properties file
09:20 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> jardineworks_: well it seems that portal.properties can't override all properties. There is a list available and the customisation of the breadcrumb is not in
09:20 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> jardineworks_: I ended putting my properties in the portal-ext.properties
09:21 < jardineworks_:#liferay> nicolas_FR, correct -- if you are using eclipse + the Liferay plugins, it'll give you the list.
09:21 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> jardineworks_: indeed

10:35 < jardineworks_:#liferay> hey jhf you around?
10:36 <@jhf:#liferay> yup
10:38 < jardineworks_:#liferay> jhf, question for you. I'm working with the resource importer -- the EE version you helped me find. I'm making some modifications to the code and rather than use the "ResourceImporterHotDeployListener" .. I am making my own copy of it called XXXResourceImporterHotDeployListener.
10:39 < jardineworks_:#liferay> I then updated the messaging-spring.xml file from the package...
10:39 < jardineworks_:#liferay> sorry phone
10:39 < jardineworks_:#liferay> ...
10:39 < jardineworks_:#liferay> uhh,,,
10:40 < jardineworks_:#liferay> right so I updated the xml for the listeners section to use my custom listener
10:40 < jardineworks_:#liferay> same package and all that for the moment.
10:40 < jardineworks_:#liferay> I deploy and everything is fine. But when I deploy my theme, it doesn't run :( ... if I change the XML back to the LR version and deploy the theme it does run.
10:40 < jardineworks_:#liferay> any ideas?
10:41 <@jhf:#liferay> hmm
10:41 <@jhf:#liferay> did you create an EXT plugin?
10:42 < jardineworks_:#liferay> no
10:42 <@jhf:#liferay> whew
10:42 < jardineworks_:#liferay> its just a new web plugin
10:43 < jardineworks_:#liferay> and then I copied all the source files from the EE one into it, and then made the changes
10:43 < jardineworks_:#liferay> I thought the messaging-spring.xml, on deployment, would register my class with the portal so that it would receive messages during deployment events?
10:44 <@jhf:#liferay> hmm
10:45 <@jhf:#liferay> so you have all the other files, e.g. your web.xml is the same as RI's?
10:45 < jardineworks_:#liferay> lemme double check but I think so
10:45 < jardineworks_:#liferay> yep -- <?xml version="1.0"?>
10:45 < jardineworks_:#liferay> <web-app version="2.4" xmlns="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/j2ee" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/j2ee http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/j2ee/web-app_2_4.xsd">
10:45 < jardineworks_:#liferay> 	<context-param>
10:45 < jardineworks_:#liferay> 		<param-name>portalContextConfigLocation</param-name>
10:45 < jardineworks_:#liferay> 		<param-value>/WEB-INF/classes/META-INF/messaging-spring.xml</param-value>
10:45 < jardineworks_:#liferay> 	</context-param>
10:45 < jardineworks_:#liferay> </web-app>
10:47 <@jhf:#liferay> and your theme includes the necessary files under resources-importer/ directory?
