04:08 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> hello htere
04:16 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> I would like to find the properties of the breadcrumbs porlets that I can modify in my velocity template so I can deploy this portlet from my theme with the good configuration. Any doc ?
05:12 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> I'm trying to create a hook (L6.1.2 GA3) to change "breadcrumb.display.style.options". I do the hook and get a src/main/resources/portal.properties file, but this doesn't work. But if I put it in my ROOT/WEB-INF/.../portal-ext.properties, there we go. What am I doing wrong in my hook ?

09:13 < jardineworks_:#liferay> nicolas_FR, the portal.properties is the place to put it -- did you also include the liferay-hook.xml config in the WEB-INF location to tell it about the properties file
09:20 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> jardineworks_: well it seems that portal.properties can't override all properties. There is a list available and the customisation of the breadcrumb is not in
09:20 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> jardineworks_: I ended putting my properties in the portal-ext.properties
09:21 < jardineworks_:#liferay> nicolas_FR, correct -- if you are using eclipse + the Liferay plugins, it'll give you the list.
09:21 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> jardineworks_: indeed

10:35 < jardineworks_:#liferay> hey jhf you around?
10:36 <@jhf:#liferay> yup
10:38 < jardineworks_:#liferay> jhf, question for you. I'm working with the resource importer -- the EE version you helped me find. I'm making some modifications to the code and rather than use the "ResourceImporterHotDeployListener" .. I am making my own copy of it called XXXResourceImporterHotDeployListener.
10:39 < jardineworks_:#liferay> I then updated the messaging-spring.xml file from the package...
10:39 < jardineworks_:#liferay> sorry phone
10:39 < jardineworks_:#liferay> ...
10:39 < jardineworks_:#liferay> uhh,,,
10:40 < jardineworks_:#liferay> right so I updated the xml for the listeners section to use my custom listener
10:40 < jardineworks_:#liferay> same package and all that for the moment.
10:40 < jardineworks_:#liferay> I deploy and everything is fine. But when I deploy my theme, it doesn't run :( ... if I change the XML back to the LR version and deploy the theme it does run.
10:40 < jardineworks_:#liferay> any ideas?
10:41 <@jhf:#liferay> hmm
10:41 <@jhf:#liferay> did you create an EXT plugin?
10:42 < jardineworks_:#liferay> no
10:42 <@jhf:#liferay> whew
10:42 < jardineworks_:#liferay> its just a new web plugin
10:43 < jardineworks_:#liferay> and then I copied all the source files from the EE one into it, and then made the changes
10:43 < jardineworks_:#liferay> I thought the messaging-spring.xml, on deployment, would register my class with the portal so that it would receive messages during deployment events?
10:44 <@jhf:#liferay> hmm
10:45 <@jhf:#liferay> so you have all the other files, e.g. your web.xml is the same as RI's?
10:45 < jardineworks_:#liferay> lemme double check but I think so
10:45 < jardineworks_:#liferay> yep -- <?xml version="1.0"?>
10:45 < jardineworks_:#liferay> <web-app version="2.4" xmlns="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/j2ee" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/j2ee http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/j2ee/web-app_2_4.xsd">

10:45 < jardineworks_:#liferay> 		<param-name>portalContextConfigLocation</param-name>
10:45 < jardineworks_:#liferay> 		<param-value>/WEB-INF/classes/META-INF/messaging-spring.xml</param-value>
10:45 < jardineworks_:#liferay> 	</context-param>
10:45 < jardineworks_:#liferay> </web-app>
10:47 <@jhf:#liferay> and your theme includes the necessary files under resources-importer/ directory?
10:48 < jardineworks_:#liferay> well, even if it didn't... I have a comment in the onDeploy method that says its starting which doesn't show in the console (its INFO level, which is enabled so it should)
10:48 < jardineworks_:#liferay> but yeah -- I made a HUGE tutorial for my client with step by step details on how to use it
10:48 <@jhf:#liferay> so your theme is never even seen by the ThemeHotDeployer ?
10:49 < jardineworks_:#liferay> no, the theme does deploy,
10:49 <@jhf:#liferay> or just the resources aren't importerd
10:49 < jardineworks_:#liferay> the latter
10:52 < jardineworks_:#liferay> hmmm -- just did a diff on the directories and the only difference is that mine has the XXXResourceImporterHotDeployListener :(
10:52 < jardineworks_:#liferay> (and the config in the messaging xml file of course)
10:52 <@jhf:#liferay> and its just that one line that's different?
10:52 <@jhf:#liferay> 	<bean id="messageListener.hot_deploy" class="com.liferay.resourcesimporter.messaging.ResourcesImporterHotDeployMessageListener" />
10:53 <@jhf:#liferay> I wonder if it has something to do with it being EE..
10:53 <@jhf:#liferay> or are you using CE?
10:53 < jardineworks_:#liferay> yeah, just that one line -- EE this time
10:55 < jardineworks_:#liferay> if i put a breakpoint and try to debug anywhere in that class, it never registers -- meaning it never stops at a breakpoint so I assume that means it's not running.
10:55 <@jhf:#liferay> no errors when deploying your custom web plugin?
10:55 <@jhf:#liferay> (not the theme)
10:56 < jardineworks_:#liferay> nope -- lemme try again just to make sure... no stack traces anyway
11:00 < jardineworks_:#liferay> jhf, 14:59:06,629 INFO  [com.liferay.portal.kernel.deploy.auto.AutoDeployScanner][BaseDeployer:2383] Modifying Servlet 2.4 /home/aj/projects/ypg/liferay/liferay-portal-6.2.10.1-ee-ga1/tomcat-7.0.42/temp/20140924145906576/WEB-INF/web.xml
11:01 < jardineworks_:#liferay> no errors
11:01 < jardineworks_:#liferay> poop
11:01 <@jhf:#liferay> it's some kind of spring wiring issue.. can you crank up spring debug? (I've never done this so no idea)
11:02 < jardineworks_:#liferay> lol
11:02 < jardineworks_:#liferay> have to see how to do that... or even debug the message sender for deployments maybe
11:03 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah that too :)
11:03 <@jhf:#liferay> I'm sure it's something simple
11:03 <@jhf:#liferay> rotty3000 would know :(
11:04 < jardineworks_:#liferay> where the heck is that guy?! no love for months now.
11:04 <@jhf:#liferay> he's around, just busy I think. spent the summer in LA
11:05 < jardineworks_:#liferay> what a waste. I would have pushed for spending the winter in LA -- especially considering where in Canada HE lives :)
11:05 < jardineworks_:#liferay> Toronto is tropical compared to the northern tundra!
