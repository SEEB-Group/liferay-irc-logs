04:08 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> hello htere
04:16 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> I would like to find the properties of the breadcrumbs porlets that I can modify in my velocity template so I can deploy this portlet from my theme with the good configuration. Any doc ?
05:12 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> I'm trying to create a hook (L6.1.2 GA3) to change "breadcrumb.display.style.options". I do the hook and get a src/main/resources/portal.properties file, but this doesn't work. But if I put it in my ROOT/WEB-INF/.../portal-ext.properties, there we go. What am I doing wrong in my hook ?

09:13 < jardineworks_:#liferay> nicolas_FR, the portal.properties is the place to put it -- did you also include the liferay-hook.xml config in the WEB-INF location to tell it about the properties file
09:20 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> jardineworks_: well it seems that portal.properties can't override all properties. There is a list available and the customisation of the breadcrumb is not in
09:20 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> jardineworks_: I ended putting my properties in the portal-ext.properties
09:21 < jardineworks_:#liferay> nicolas_FR, correct -- if you are using eclipse + the Liferay plugins, it'll give you the list.
09:21 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> jardineworks_: indeed
10:17 -!- mode/#liferay [+o jhf] by ChanServ
10:35 < jardineworks_:#liferay> hey jhf you around?
10:36 <@jhf:#liferay> yup
10:38 < jardineworks_:#liferay> jhf, question for you. I'm working with the resource importer -- the EE version you helped me find. I'm making some modifications to the code and rather than use the "ResourceImporterHotDeployListener" .. I am making my own copy of it called XXXResourceImporterHotDeployListener.
10:39 < jardineworks_:#liferay> I then updated the messaging-spring.xml file from the package...
10:39 < jardineworks_:#liferay> sorry phone
10:39 < jardineworks_:#liferay> ...
10:39 < jardineworks_:#liferay> uhh,,,
10:40 < jardineworks_:#liferay> right so I updated the xml for the listeners section to use my custom listener
10:40 < jardineworks_:#liferay> same package and all that for the moment.
10:40 < jardineworks_:#liferay> I deploy and everything is fine. But when I deploy my theme, it doesn't run :( ... if I change the XML back to the LR version and deploy the theme it does run.
10:40 < jardineworks_:#liferay> any ideas?
10:41 <@jhf:#liferay> hmm
10:41 <@jhf:#liferay> did you create an EXT plugin?
10:42 < jardineworks_:#liferay> no
10:42 <@jhf:#liferay> whew
10:42 < jardineworks_:#liferay> its just a new web plugin
10:43 < jardineworks_:#liferay> and then I copied all the source files from the EE one into it, and then made the changes
10:43 < jardineworks_:#liferay> I thought the messaging-spring.xml, on deployment, would register my class with the portal so that it would receive messages during deployment events?
10:44 <@jhf:#liferay> hmm
10:45 <@jhf:#liferay> so you have all the other files, e.g. your web.xml is the same as RI's?
10:45 < jardineworks_:#liferay> lemme double check but I think so
10:45 < jardineworks_:#liferay> yep -- <?xml version="1.0"?>
10:45 < jardineworks_:#liferay> <web-app version="2.4" xmlns="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/j2ee" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/j2ee http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/j2ee/web-app_2_4.xsd">
10:45 < jardineworks_:#liferay> 	<context-param>
10:45 < jardineworks_:#liferay> 		<param-name>portalContextConfigLocation</param-name>
10:45 < jardineworks_:#liferay> 		<param-value>/WEB-INF/classes/META-INF/messaging-spring.xml</param-value>
10:45 < jardineworks_:#liferay> 	</context-param>
10:45 < jardineworks_:#liferay> </web-app>
10:47 <@jhf:#liferay> and your theme includes the necessary files under resources-importer/ directory?
10:48 < jardineworks_:#liferay> well, even if it didn't... I have a comment in the onDeploy method that says its starting which doesn't show in the console (its INFO level, which is enabled so it should)
10:48 < jardineworks_:#liferay> but yeah -- I made a HUGE tutorial for my client with step by step details on how to use it
10:48 <@jhf:#liferay> so your theme is never even seen by the ThemeHotDeployer ?
10:49 < jardineworks_:#liferay> no, the theme does deploy,
10:49 <@jhf:#liferay> or just the resources aren't importerd
10:49 < jardineworks_:#liferay> the latter
10:52 < jardineworks_:#liferay> hmmm -- just did a diff on the directories and the only difference is that mine has the XXXResourceImporterHotDeployListener :(
10:52 < jardineworks_:#liferay> (and the config in the messaging xml file of course)
10:52 <@jhf:#liferay> and its just that one line that's different?
10:52 <@jhf:#liferay> 	<bean id="messageListener.hot_deploy" class="com.liferay.resourcesimporter.messaging.ResourcesImporterHotDeployMessageListener" />
10:53 <@jhf:#liferay> I wonder if it has something to do with it being EE..
10:53 <@jhf:#liferay> or are you using CE?
10:53 < jardineworks_:#liferay> yeah, just that one line -- EE this time
10:55 < jardineworks_:#liferay> if i put a breakpoint and try to debug anywhere in that class, it never registers -- meaning it never stops at a breakpoint so I assume that means it's not running.
10:55 <@jhf:#liferay> no errors when deploying your custom web plugin?
10:55 <@jhf:#liferay> (not the theme)
10:56 < jardineworks_:#liferay> nope -- lemme try again just to make sure... no stack traces anyway
11:00 < jardineworks_:#liferay> jhf, 14:59:06,629 INFO  [com.liferay.portal.kernel.deploy.auto.AutoDeployScanner][BaseDeployer:2383] Modifying Servlet 2.4 /home/aj/projects/ypg/liferay/liferay-portal-6.2.10.1-ee-ga1/tomcat-7.0.42/temp/20140924145906576/WEB-INF/web.xml
11:01 < jardineworks_:#liferay> no errors
11:01 < jardineworks_:#liferay> poop
11:01 <@jhf:#liferay> it's some kind of spring wiring issue.. can you crank up spring debug? (I've never done this so no idea)
11:02 < jardineworks_:#liferay> lol
11:02 < jardineworks_:#liferay> have to see how to do that... or even debug the message sender for deployments maybe
11:03 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah that too :)
11:03 <@jhf:#liferay> I'm sure it's something simple
11:03 <@jhf:#liferay> rotty3000 would know :(
11:04 < jardineworks_:#liferay> where the heck is that guy?! no love for months now.
11:04 <@jhf:#liferay> he's around, just busy I think. spent the summer in LA
11:05 < jardineworks_:#liferay> what a waste. I would have pushed for spending the winter in LA -- especially considering where in Canada HE lives :)
11:05 < jardineworks_:#liferay> Toronto is tropical compared to the northern tundra!
11:19 < Urug_:#liferay> I have got a Template (News) for a Structure (News). Now I need another Template (Specialized News) will include the existing Template (News). The problem is how do I find out the file name of the existing Template (News) to include it using <#include "${templatesPath}/news_template_unknown_file_name.ftl" />
11:22 <@jhf:#liferay> Urug_: on the template editing screen
11:22 <@jhf:#liferay> there is a "URL" field
11:23 <@jhf:#liferay> you can also use the "Template Key" instead
11:23 <@jhf:#liferay> lemme dig up the URL scheme for that
11:23 < Urug_:#liferay> Well I tried that without success
11:24 <@jhf:#liferay> have you tried
11:24 <@jhf:#liferay> <#include "${templatesPath}/11514" />
11:24 <@jhf:#liferay> (replace 11514 with template key)
11:24 <@jhf:#liferay> (I got that from https://www.liferay.com/community/forums/-/message_boards/message/28108067 )
11:25 < Urug_:#liferay> Oh I have been adding the".ftl" at the end. Its' working now, thank you very much.
11:25 <@jhf:#liferay> n/p
11:27 < Urug_:#liferay> Btw is there a way to have one Template linked to multiple Structures?
11:28 < Urug_:#liferay> I have to duplicate the Template which just includes the Some Generic Template to achieve that.
12:06 < jardineworks_:#liferay> jhf, \o/ .. worked just like it is supposed to. Just took me spending an hour crawling all over the deployment porcess stepping through classes (changing nothing) to get it to go :)
12:06 < jardineworks_:#liferay> but at least I understand more about how the deployment process works and what it does now! :)
12:10 <@jhf:#liferay> heh.. https://imgflip.com/i/cf4u7
12:17 < jardineworks_:#liferay> lol
12:52 < modd:#liferay> jhf: do you have a minute?
12:53 <@jhf:#liferay> unfortunately no, I have to run out to pick up my son from school - but will be back in about 45 minutes
12:53 < modd:#liferay> ok
12:53 < modd:#liferay> np
12:53 < modd:#liferay> your son is more important than anything I can come up with ;)
13:11 < Urug_:#liferay> How to list Folders in Media Gallery Portlet Template? Available variable entries contains only files.
13:40 -!- mode/#liferay [+o _jhf_] by ChanServ
13:41 < Urug_:#liferay> omg serviceLocator is undefined in template even thou it's whispered by editor
13:48 < Urug_:#liferay> Hm ... looks like there is a concept of restricted variables from 6.2
14:01 < Urug_:#liferay> Where should I place portal-ext.properties?
14:04 < Urug_:#liferay> tomcat-7.0.42\webapps\ROOT\WEB-INF\classes\portal-ext.properties ?
14:36 < modd:#liferay> hey jhf, still there? I've missed the 45minutes ;)
14:42 < jardineworks_:#liferay> Urug_, you can put it there or you can put it in your LIFERAY_HOME.
14:47 < Urug_:#liferay> ok, thanks
14:49 < Urug_:#liferay> Any way to get DLFolderConstants from template? I would say getting constants is problematic in templates in general...
14:50 < Urug_:#liferay> For example I cant access WebKeys as well
15:13 <@jhf:#liferay> hey modd yeah sorry - am back
15:19 < Urug_:#liferay> I am editing media display portlet template (application display template) and I need to create URL to the same page+portlet and change only "folderId" parameter. I am pretty sure there are many ways how to do that and I am looking for the fastest.
15:20 < modd:#liferay> jhf: do you know why service builder doesn't allow to have inputstream or outputstream return types anymore? it's even hardcoded
15:20 < modd:#liferay> in 6.1 even liferay services used it, like dlfileentry service get-file-as-stream
15:21 < modd:#liferay> but now everything is gone and it's not possible anymore
15:23 <@jhf:#liferay> uhh. are you referring to supporting blob types?
15:23 < modd:#liferay> nope
15:23 < modd:#liferay> I want to return an inputstream
15:23 < modd:#liferay> I have a json service, which should return a file
15:24 < modd:#liferay> my workaround is to return the download url, but it'd like to have the real thing ;)
15:25 <@jhf:#liferay> hmm.. ok. I think I was thinking about entities in a database that you use servicebuilder to access. you're actually wanting the JSON service infrastructure to handle streams somehow.
15:25 < modd:#liferay> yep, like it was possible in 6.1
15:25 < modd:#liferay> and another point: I'm not sure if it's a bug or rather a feature request, but sometimes I see massive problems with resource permissions. if you create resources in liferay for your own entities but have a typo in the resource-actions xml, you won't get any visible errors/exceptions, but some hidden methodinvokeexceptions and it takes ages to debug it. some kind of deployment xml parser-checks would be nice
15:26 <@jhf:#liferay> modd: is this the change that removed the support :https://issues.liferay.com/browse/LPS-40422
15:26 < modd:#liferay> these two thinks are currently bothering me :\
15:26 < modd:#liferay> yep, looks correct
15:26 <@jhf:#liferay> modd: +1 on that - it's in that gray area between bug and new feature.
15:27 <@jhf:#liferay> and you can find the justification here: https://issues.liferay.com/browse/LPP-9919 "This was a mistake to be included in our API, that's why we removed it. There is no good way to handle input streams in JSON, because they are not Serializeable. We could give them raw binary data, but that would be pretty strange to handle in JavaScript.
15:27 <@jhf:#liferay> Instead, they should use WebDav"
15:27 < modd:#liferay> "as they dont make sense as remote services"..well, not in my view^^
15:27 < modd:#liferay> Permission Violation ;(
15:28 < modd:#liferay> well, actually, I'm not using js for it
15:28 <@jhf:#liferay> ah sorry
15:28 <@jhf:#liferay> that was an LPP ticket
15:28 < modd:#liferay> it's some strange task I got^^
15:28 < modd:#liferay> the whole thing will be used as rest service which is used by a C# program
15:29 <@jhf:#liferay> so here's a possible workaround: https://www.liferay.com/community/forums/-/message_boards/view_message/20990842#_19_message_22438638
15:29 <@jhf:#liferay> (it would require an EXT plugin I think)
15:30 < modd:#liferay> well, I know how to do it with EXT. I was hoping, that it may be changed/fixed again^^
15:31 < modd:#liferay> btw: my devcon entry was rejected^^
15:31 < modd:#liferay> too generic and "people shouldn't use 'hidden' features"^^
15:31 <@jhf:#liferay> awwww.. sorry to hear that!
15:31 < modd:#liferay> well, maybe I'll use the unconference for it
15:32 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah I would highly recommend doing that.
15:32 < modd:#liferay> :)
15:32 < modd:#liferay> at least it's pretty sure that we will finally meet ;)
15:33 <@jhf:#liferay> indeed! :)
15:33 < modd:#liferay> ehm..about the resource actions thing: should I create a ticket or any idea what to do?
15:33 <@jhf:#liferay> I will look for the giant bird-man costume
15:33 < modd:#liferay> hehe^^
15:34 < modd:#liferay> I should organize one^^
15:34 < modd:#liferay> maybe something like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mAODy_lcnw
15:34 <@jhf:#liferay> yep, I would file a bug (I mean, it should fail visibly when you screw up xml)
15:35 <@jhf:#liferay> LOL
15:35 <@jhf:#liferay> that would be amazing
15:35 < modd:#liferay> ok, I'll create one tomorrow and give you the ticket number ;)
15:38 < modd:#liferay> do you guys plan to make the LDN page public at devcon?
15:51 < Urug_:#liferay> maybe stupid question ... how do i get string from long? getterUtil.getString(longNumber) is returning empty string
15:57 < Urug_:#liferay> omg i got stuck on such triffle
15:58 < modd:#liferay> like long foo=5;String bar = foo;..something like this?
15:59 < modd:#liferay> if yes then String.valueof(long)
15:59 < modd:#liferay> Of*
16:00 < Urug_:#liferay> i am in template i dont have an access to java.lang.String
