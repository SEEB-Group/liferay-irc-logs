03:23 < winem_:#liferay> good morning
03:25 < winem_:#liferay> a question regarding the portal-ext.properties. I'd like to define all pathes to directories storing content, java content repositories and so on in a different folder which is not inside the JBOSS_HOME
03:25 < winem_:#liferay> just to be able to increase the partition size if it grows too much, easier backups and so on. which properties do I need for it? resource.repositories.root is not enough, or?!
05:13 < winem_:#liferay> sorry, was offline for a while. was there any reply to my question?
09:09 < Uzzi:#liferay> hi
09:11 < Uzzi:#liferay> I have set ldap authentication from web panel but i havto modify the config (Unable to import user cn=.......com.liferay.portal.UserScreenNameException).I have Liferay 6.2-ce-ga2. Where are config files?
09:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> Uzzi, what field do you use for your login?
09:21 < Uzzi:#liferay> uid
09:22 < jardineworks:#liferay> winem_, will you be around in an hour?
09:22 < winem_:#liferay> yep :)
09:22 < jardineworks:#liferay> Uzzi, if you don't need the screenname, then you can always set it to be ayto-generated so that the mapping doesn not work. The exception is probably that you are specifying a valid map, but that the field in LDAP contains characters that you are not allowed to use
09:22 < Uzzi:#liferay> but now witth wrong config I cannot login in my liferay
09:23 < jardineworks:#liferay> to auto-gen the screen name, under the portal settings, under User there should be a checkbox.
09:23 < jardineworks:#liferay> Uzzi, Do you know the companyId?
09:24 < Uzzi:#liferay> jardineworks: I haven't acces to portal settings on web
09:24 < jardineworks:#liferay> Uzzi, sorry -- can you get into the control panel?
09:24 < Uzzi:#liferay> there is not companyId in my OpenLDAP
09:25 < Uzzi:#liferay> I can not get control panel
09:25 < jardineworks:#liferay> Uzzi, ok -- can you query your database?
09:25 < Uzzi:#liferay> yes
09:25 < jardineworks:#liferay> query the VirtualHost table and get the companyId for your host
09:26 < jardineworks:#liferay> then query the PortalPreferences table where the ownerId = companyId
09:26 < Uzzi:#liferay> I havo found companyId
09:26 < jardineworks:#liferay> find the <preference/> node where LDAP is enabled and the one where it is required, and set them to false.
09:26 < jardineworks:#liferay> that will disable LDAP as your authentication method
09:26 < jardineworks:#liferay> OR
09:26 < jardineworks:#liferay> actually
09:26 < jardineworks:#liferay> sorry
09:27 < jardineworks:#liferay> easier way might be to set the property in the portal-ext.
09:27 < jardineworks:#liferay>     #
09:27 < jardineworks:#liferay>     # Set this to true to always autogenerate user screen names even if the user
09:27 < jardineworks:#liferay>     # gives a specific user screen name. If this is set to true, the LDAP
09:27 < jardineworks:#liferay>     # importer will fetch users by their email address even if the property
09:27 < jardineworks:#liferay>     # "company.security.auth.type" is set to screenName.
09:27 < jardineworks:#liferay>     #
09:27 < jardineworks:#liferay>     users.screen.name.always.autogenerate=false
09:27 < jardineworks:#liferay> set that to tru and restart
09:27 < jardineworks:#liferay> then the import will probably work.
09:27 < Uzzi:#liferay> I have not portal-ext
09:28 < jardineworks:#liferay> eh? no portal-ext? are you using hypersonic?
09:28 < jardineworks:#liferay> doesn
09:29 < Uzzi:#liferay> I have not a file named portal/ext
09:29 < jardineworks:#liferay> doesn't really matter -- create a file called portal-ext.properties in your LIFERAY_HOME folder (one up from TOMCAT_HOME usually) and in it put that property but set the value to true
09:29 < jardineworks:#liferay> conf call.. bbiab
09:30 < Uzzi:#liferay> in the same dir where there is portal-setup-wizard.properties _
09:30 < Uzzi:#liferay> _
09:43 < jardineworks:#liferay> yes
10:00 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Hey guys.
10:01 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I just ran into another jolly Liferay issue (probably).
10:01 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> We're using the DL to store quite a large amount of images.
10:01 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> And as our setup is running in the Amazon cloud, we configured it to use the S3.
10:01 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> We see loads of "Too many open files" errors in our logfile.
10:02 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> And I've had a bad feeling about this S3 implementation for quite a while.
10:02 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Anyone ever used that and noticed some bad quality in this "adapter"?
10:13 < Uzzi:#liferay> it's better have portal-ext.properties?
10:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> Uzzi, normally this is where you provide the overrides to portal.properties (default) settings.
10:22 < jardineworks:#liferay> Uzzi, however, things that are configurable in the control panel, Liferay recommends that you do them in the control panel not the portal-ext -- mostly because items in the control panel are (portal) instance based. If you put it in the portal-ext, the same setting will be applied to all portal instances.
10:23 < jardineworks:#liferay> winem_, Is your question for the storage location of the DocumentLibrary assets?
10:24 < winem_:#liferay> yes. all files which will be stored locally on the server and not on the database
10:26 < jardineworks:#liferay> winem_, are you using the default document library store/
10:26 < jardineworks:#liferay> ?
10:26 < jardineworks:#liferay> winem_, meaning, have you overridden the dl.store.impl property?
10:26 < winem_:#liferay> it's completely new setup. I can realize wahtever your recommend
10:26 < winem_:#liferay> no
10:26 < jardineworks:#liferay> winem_, ok -- so by default it is dl.store.impl=com.liferay.portlet.documentlibrary.store.FileSystemStore
10:27 < jardineworks:#liferay> and this is the property for the storage location --
10:27 < jardineworks:#liferay> #
10:27 < jardineworks:#liferay>     # FileSystemStore
10:27 < jardineworks:#liferay>     #
10:27 < jardineworks:#liferay>     dl.store.file.system.root.dir=${liferay.home}/data/document_library
10:27 < jardineworks:#liferay> which of course you can change --
10:28 < jardineworks:#liferay> e.g. dl.store.file.system.root.dir=/mnt/document_library -- or whatever
10:32 < winem_:#liferay> great, thanks :)
10:32 < winem_:#liferay> resource.repositories.root is only used for the java content store?
10:35 < jardineworks:#liferay>     #
10:35 < jardineworks:#liferay>     # This property is available for backwards compatibility. Please set the
10:35 < jardineworks:#liferay>     # property "liferay.home" instead.
10:35 < jardineworks:#liferay>     #
10:35 < jardineworks:#liferay>     resource.repositories.root=${default.liferay.home}
10:35 < winem_:#liferay> ups, thanks
10:35 < winem_:#liferay> which source do you use for those informations?
10:35 < jardineworks:#liferay> winem_, pretty silly name though
10:47 < jardineworks:#liferay> winem_, https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/blob/6.2.x/portal-impl/src/portal.properties
10:50 < winem_:#liferay> great, I have a new bookmark :)
10:50 < rrapozo:#liferay> Good afternoon everyone!
10:50 < rrapozo:#liferay> Someone knows how I can send a object from jsp to java?
10:50 < jardineworks:#liferay> rrapozo, usually the other way aroung
10:50 < jardineworks:#liferay> around*
10:51 < rrapozo:#liferay> :)
10:52 < rrapozo:#liferay> yes, but I need send a object to another page with actionURL
10:53 < rrapozo:#liferay> A other way to do that is disassemble the object and send a lot parameters but I cand do that too
