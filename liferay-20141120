03:23 < winem_:#liferay> good morning
03:25 < winem_:#liferay> a question regarding the portal-ext.properties. I'd like to define all pathes to directories storing content, java content repositories and so on in a different folder which is not inside the JBOSS_HOME
03:25 < winem_:#liferay> just to be able to increase the partition size if it grows too much, easier backups and so on. which properties do I need for it? resource.repositories.root is not enough, or?!
05:13 < winem_:#liferay> sorry, was offline for a while. was there any reply to my question?
09:09 < Uzzi:#liferay> hi
09:11 < Uzzi:#liferay> I have set ldap authentication from web panel but i havto modify the config (Unable to import user cn=.......com.liferay.portal.UserScreenNameException).I have Liferay 6.2-ce-ga2. Where are config files?
09:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> Uzzi, what field do you use for your login?
09:21 < Uzzi:#liferay> uid
09:22 < jardineworks:#liferay> winem_, will you be around in an hour?
09:22 < winem_:#liferay> yep :)
09:22 < jardineworks:#liferay> Uzzi, if you don't need the screenname, then you can always set it to be ayto-generated so that the mapping doesn not work. The exception is probably that you are specifying a valid map, but that the field in LDAP contains characters that you are not allowed to use
09:22 < Uzzi:#liferay> but now witth wrong config I cannot login in my liferay
09:23 < jardineworks:#liferay> to auto-gen the screen name, under the portal settings, under User there should be a checkbox.
09:23 < jardineworks:#liferay> Uzzi, Do you know the companyId?
09:24 < Uzzi:#liferay> jardineworks: I haven't acces to portal settings on web
09:24 < jardineworks:#liferay> Uzzi, sorry -- can you get into the control panel?
09:24 < Uzzi:#liferay> there is not companyId in my OpenLDAP
09:25 < Uzzi:#liferay> I can not get control panel
09:25 < jardineworks:#liferay> Uzzi, ok -- can you query your database?
09:25 < Uzzi:#liferay> yes
09:25 < jardineworks:#liferay> query the VirtualHost table and get the companyId for your host
09:26 < jardineworks:#liferay> then query the PortalPreferences table where the ownerId = companyId
09:26 < Uzzi:#liferay> I havo found companyId
09:26 < jardineworks:#liferay> find the <preference/> node where LDAP is enabled and the one where it is required, and set them to false.
09:26 < jardineworks:#liferay> that will disable LDAP as your authentication method
09:26 < jardineworks:#liferay> OR
09:26 < jardineworks:#liferay> actually
09:26 < jardineworks:#liferay> sorry
