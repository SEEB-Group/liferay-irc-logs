10:02 < aj_> quiet day in the channel. where are all the Liferay folks hiding these days?
10:17 < bijoo_> aj_: hmmm have you tried stepping through the code there?
10:18 < aj_> bijoo_, not yet but I have done this once before and the code I wrote last time made use of the BooleanQuery* objects explicitly.
10:18 < aj_> I remember I tried to use it once before and had no luck... I think its a red herring :)
10:33 < bijoo_> aj_: can you give me example what you want?
10:33 < aj_> bijoo_, I got it working :)
10:33 < bijoo_> aj_: cool, what was it and what was the goal there?
10:33 < aj_> I found that the last guy had created a CustomFacetedSearcher ... whcih of course defines a boolean query.
10:34 < aj_> I changed the SHOULD to MUST for the keyword parsing and query building and it worked.
10:34 < bijoo_> aj_: ah okay, had some custom code in there.
10:34 < aj_> but ultimately..
10:34 < bijoo_> aj_: cool glad to hear it is working here.
10:34 < aj_> what I was trying to do is change the default behviour for search so that instead of the implied "teachers OR pensions" it would be "teachers AND pensions"
10:35 < aj_> but the user only enters teachers pensions as a search query of course.
10:43 < aj_> bijoo_, are you going to enter another plugin into this years competition?
11:20 < bijoo_> aj_: cool; yes! Upgrading the old ones as well. Last year I didn't prep properly there; at the last week, churned portlets for 2 days.
11:20 < bijoo_> aj_: This year I want to plan properly there ;) and maybe submit through my company.
11:21 < aj_> bijoo_, do you work for someone else? or for yourself?
11:23 < bijoo_> aj_: No, I work in my company: SEEB Group
11:24 < aj_> no familiar... snooping :)
11:24 < bijoo_> :)
11:25 < aj_> https://seebgroup.com/ .. is that it?
11:25 < bijoo_> aj_: did you participate in last year's too?
11:25 < aj_> I did not but if I can find some time I would like to this year
11:25 < bijoo_> aj_: yes, that is the company's website there.
11:25 < aj_> where is it located?
11:26 -!- mode/#liferay [+o jhf] by ChanServ
11:26 < bijoo_> aj_: I strongly recommend that you try it; competition will be tougher this year; but the rules have changed too, so never know!
11:26 < bijoo_> aj_: It is based in Washingiton, D.C. there; but most clients are all over the world.
11:26 < aj_> i just love building plugins... I don't really care if I win or not
11:27 < aj_> bijoo_, are you in DC?
11:28 < bijoo_> aj_: my strategy last year was too funny; I thought there is no limit on plugins; so I'll make a quick and dirty plugin; and then put in effort to make some more. The plugin with most effort won me spot; but the quick and dirty one was most used! It got over 300 downloads now; and is one I updated most often.
11:28 < bijoo_> aj_: yes, I live in Washington, D.c. now.
11:29 < aj_> hahaha you did the IRC plugin right?
11:29 < aj_> what are the other ones you did
11:29 < aj_> ?
11:30 < bijoo_> aj_: the IRC channel history too; http://goo.gl/SMte1N
