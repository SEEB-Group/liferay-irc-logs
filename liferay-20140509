10:02 < aj_> quiet day in the channel. where are all the Liferay folks hiding these days?
10:17 < bijoo_> aj_: hmmm have you tried stepping through the code there?
10:18 < aj_> bijoo_, not yet but I have done this once before and the code I wrote last time made use of the BooleanQuery* objects explicitly.
10:18 < aj_> I remember I tried to use it once before and had no luck... I think its a red herring :)
10:33 < bijoo_> aj_: can you give me example what you want?
10:33 < aj_> bijoo_, I got it working :)
10:33 < bijoo_> aj_: cool, what was it and what was the goal there?
10:33 < aj_> I found that the last guy had created a CustomFacetedSearcher ... whcih of course defines a boolean query.
10:34 < aj_> I changed the SHOULD to MUST for the keyword parsing and query building and it worked.
10:34 < bijoo_> aj_: ah okay, had some custom code in there.
10:34 < aj_> but ultimately..
10:34 < bijoo_> aj_: cool glad to hear it is working here.
10:34 < aj_> what I was trying to do is change the default behviour for search so that instead of the implied "teachers OR pensions" it would be "teachers AND pensions"
10:35 < aj_> but the user only enters teachers pensions as a search query of course.
10:43 < aj_> bijoo_, are you going to enter another plugin into this years competition?
11:20 < bijoo_> aj_: cool; yes! Upgrading the old ones as well. Last year I didn't prep properly there; at the last week, churned portlets for 2 days.
11:20 < bijoo_> aj_: This year I want to plan properly there ;) and maybe submit through my company.
11:21 < aj_> bijoo_, do you work for someone else? or for yourself?
