10:02 < aj_> quiet day in the channel. where are all the Liferay folks hiding these days?
10:17 < bijoo_> aj_: hmmm have you tried stepping through the code there?
10:18 < aj_> bijoo_, not yet but I have done this once before and the code I wrote last time made use of the BooleanQuery* objects explicitly.
10:18 < aj_> I remember I tried to use it once before and had no luck... I think its a red herring :)
10:33 < bijoo_> aj_: can you give me example what you want?
10:33 < aj_> bijoo_, I got it working :)
10:33 < bijoo_> aj_: cool, what was it and what was the goal there?
10:33 < aj_> I found that the last guy had created a CustomFacetedSearcher ... whcih of course defines a boolean query.
