03:05 < Ababab:#liferay> Hi. My autodeploy works fine, but can I set it to clean the unpacked folder before it deploys the new version? I'm having problems with Spring if I move a bean from a package to another, as it causes name conflicts
04:34 < Axxell:#liferay> Hey guys, just experienced something wonderfull </sarcasm>, by editing global categories in liferay 6.1, where the categories are not just a flat list but a tree structure, the categories got corrupt so that they do not show as they are supposed to, anybody know anything about a bug in that area and if there is a fix. Any information about the assetcategory table in the database would also be appreciated, thanks
04:39 < Axxell:#liferay> closer inspection reveals that it might not be corruption of the data, but the interface which is not working as its suppposed to in the control panel, anybody know anything about the javascript bugging when you edit categories in the control panel for the global scope?
