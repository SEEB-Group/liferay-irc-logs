03:05 < Ababab:#liferay> Hi. My autodeploy works fine, but can I set it to clean the unpacked folder before it deploys the new version? I'm having problems with Spring if I move a bean from a package to another, as it causes name conflicts
04:34 < Axxell:#liferay> Hey guys, just experienced something wonderfull </sarcasm>, by editing global categories in liferay 6.1, where the categories are not just a flat list but a tree structure, the categories got corrupt so that they do not show as they are supposed to, anybody know anything about a bug in that area and if there is a fix. Any information about the assetcategory table in the database would also be appreciated, thanks
04:39 < Axxell:#liferay> closer inspection reveals that it might not be corruption of the data, but the interface which is not working as its suppposed to in the control panel, anybody know anything about the javascript bugging when you edit categories in the control panel for the global scope?
04:41 < Axxell:#liferay> ie when choosing categories while working with categories or files, everything works as its supposed to, only the category editing thing is showing the category tree wrong for one vocabulary
06:23 < Axxell:#liferay> So about yesterdays problem: Does anybody know how to sort an assetentryquery by a filed in the assets structure, ie i have an article with at structure that has a date field, i want to do a assetentryquery and sort with that field?
13:35 < marrk:#liferay> modd hier? :)
13:42 < marrk:#liferay> or anyone else that can help me with IPC?
13:42 < modd:#liferay> marrk: what's the problem?
13:42 < marrk:#liferay> du konntest doch deutsch?:)
13:42 < modd:#liferay> jop, ist den anderen aber ungerecht gegen√ºber, ist immerhin ein internationaler channel
13:43 < marrk:#liferay> hi, i am using an url id to communicate between 2 pages at the moment (like this: view.jsp?id=x but when i set a renderparameter on the 2nd page, the url is changed and i cant use my id anymore,  anyway to solve this problem or do i need another solution to communicate between those 2 pages?
13:43 < marrk:#liferay> did cp earlier post
13:44 < modd:#liferay> ipc is for 2 portlets on the same page, not for 1 portlet at 2 pages
13:44 < marrk:#liferay> yeah, i use IPC on the 2nd page
13:45 < marrk:#liferay> but i need to give a parameter from 1st to 2nd so i use "http://localhost:7070/web/guest/process?id=45"
13:45 < modd:#liferay> you have to read your parameter and set it again into your renderURL
13:46 < marrk:#liferay> so renderURl is going to work for the same page all day long? or do i have to set it every time i call a function ?
13:48 < modd:#liferay> how do you call the second page?
13:48 < marrk:#liferay> with actionResponse.sendRedirect
13:50 < modd:#liferay> and then?actionResponse.sendRedirect(redirectURL.toString()); ?
13:50 < marrk:#liferay> actionResponse.sendRedirect("/web/guest/process?id=" +id);
13:51 < modd:#liferay> a portlet gets scoped parameters...the scope is the id of the portlet
13:51 < modd:#liferay> so it will not "see" the id parameter
13:52 < marrk:#liferay> well as long as the url is like that, i can call the id
13:52 < marrk:#liferay> but when i do a setrenderparameter on the 2nd page, URL is changed
13:53 < modd:#liferay> have a look at this https://www.liferay.com/de/community/forums/-/message_boards/message/13969225
13:54 < modd:#liferay> afk for some minutes
13:55 < marrk:#liferay> well the other problem is: the page should be used several times at the same moment, so using an ID in the URL was pretty much perfect, because like renderParameter is overwritten every time
13:59 < marrk:#liferay> well brb
14:19 < modd:#liferay> "the page should be used several times at the same moment" ??
