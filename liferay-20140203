12:25 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, rotty3000 do either of you know if it is possible to set meta tags in a page programatically (from the portlets on the page?)
12:30 < jardineworks:#liferay> I know you can use the PortalUtil to set the description and the page title dynamically, but I can't seem to find a way to add meta-tags.
12:30 < jardineworks:#liferay> would it just be portletResponse.setHeader("...", "...");??
12:31 < jardineworks:#liferay> wait -- that doesn't make sense.
12:53 < _pier:#liferay> @jardineworks you can use <liferay-util:html-top />
12:54 < _pier:#liferay> portletResponse.setHeader is for HTTP headers
12:54 < jardineworks:#liferay> _pier, right -- I realized your second comment as soon as I wrote it. It has nothing to do with the document :). I'll check out the first one though! I didn't know about that one.
