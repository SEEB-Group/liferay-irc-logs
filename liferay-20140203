12:25 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, rotty3000 do either of you know if it is possible to set meta tags in a page programatically (from the portlets on the page?)
12:30 < jardineworks:#liferay> I know you can use the PortalUtil to set the description and the page title dynamically, but I can't seem to find a way to add meta-tags.
12:30 < jardineworks:#liferay> would it just be portletResponse.setHeader("...", "...");??
12:31 < jardineworks:#liferay> wait -- that doesn't make sense.
12:53 < _pier:#liferay> @jardineworks you can use <liferay-util:html-top />
12:54 < _pier:#liferay> portletResponse.setHeader is for HTTP headers
12:54 < jardineworks:#liferay> _pier, right -- I realized your second comment as soon as I wrote it. It has nothing to do with the document :). I'll check out the first one though! I didn't know about that one.
12:56 < _pier:#liferay> It’s a buffer which injects the buffered content into the WebKeys.HTML_TOP request attribute
12:56 < _pier:#liferay> which is then spit out in the html head
12:56 < _pier:#liferay> there’s also liferay-util:html-bottom
12:56 < _pier:#liferay> which puts content just before the body closes,
12:56 < _pier:#liferay> if I remember correctly
12:57 < jardineworks:#liferay> _pier, so if I do <liferay-util:html-top><meta name="og:title" value="this is my title"/></liferay-util:html-top> then it'll add that tag to the <head></head> section?
12:57 < jardineworks:#liferay> and I can do that from any jsp in a plugin?
12:58 < _pier:#liferay> ooooh yes
12:58 < _pier:#liferay> and that’s exactly how I use that the most,
12:58 < _pier:#liferay> for opengraph metatags ;)
12:58 < jardineworks:#liferay> _pier, awesome. Thanks so much! :)
