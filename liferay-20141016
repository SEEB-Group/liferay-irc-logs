03:29 < goku_:#liferay> hi ,am getting one long urls while trying access the liferay setup ,and the browser shows the error as this page isn't redirecting properly,how to resolve this issue?
05:43 < winem_:#liferay> morning
05:52 < winem_:#liferay> we have an issue with two sites in liferay. the first one is broken but this is used as "main site". so it says " This site is inactive. Please contact the administrator. " when I access 192.168.10.93:8080
05:52 < winem_:#liferay> how do I choose another site to be shown when this URL is called?
06:40 < winem_:#liferay> ignore it, it's fixed :)
08:12 < winem_:#liferay> and another obviously stupid question, but both of my frontend developers are ill today... where can I import the war files for the theme and layout templates? I have to move an existing page to two new instances
08:17 < winem_:#liferay> can't imagine that I have to deploy them on the filesystem. I guess there is some function in the control panel, too
08:20 < winem_:#liferay> ok, got it.. did not know that I have to do it in the app panel.. thought this was for liferay apps only :)
09:18 < Bilou:#liferay> Hi all
