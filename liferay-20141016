03:29 < goku_:#liferay> hi ,am getting one long urls while trying access the liferay setup ,and the browser shows the error as this page isn't redirecting properly,how to resolve this issue?
05:43 < winem_:#liferay> morning
05:52 < winem_:#liferay> we have an issue with two sites in liferay. the first one is broken but this is used as "main site". so it says " This site is inactive. Please contact the administrator. " when I access 192.168.10.93:8080
05:52 < winem_:#liferay> how do I choose another site to be shown when this URL is called?
06:40 < winem_:#liferay> ignore it, it's fixed :)
08:12 < winem_:#liferay> and another obviously stupid question, but both of my frontend developers are ill today... where can I import the war files for the theme and layout templates? I have to move an existing page to two new instances
08:17 < winem_:#liferay> can't imagine that I have to deploy them on the filesystem. I guess there is some function in the control panel, too
08:20 < winem_:#liferay> ok, got it.. did not know that I have to do it in the app panel.. thought this was for liferay apps only :)
09:18 < Bilou:#liferay> Hi all
09:20 < Bilou:#liferay> What are the bests framework to develop webservices producer and develop consumer in liferay
09:26 < jardineworks_:#liferay> Bilou, when you say producer, do you mean people calling the portal to access data that it houses?
09:29 < Bilou:#liferay> No i have to develop webservices producer and call services within my portal
09:38 < Bilou:#liferay> jardineworks_,   No i have to develop webservices producer alone  and call services within my portal using some known performant liferay plugins CE
09:38 < Bilou:#liferay> If exists
09:39 < Bilou:#liferay> jardineworks_,  have an idea ?

09:39 < Bilou:#liferay> jardineworks_,  have u an idea ?
09:40 < jardineworks_:#liferay> Bilou, So you are developing a separate set of web services and then using your Liferay plugins you want to make calls to those services -- is that it?
10:04 < goku_:#liferay> Hi, in liferay when i tried to use hooks ,its working on the setup from which i copied the original jsps ,but when i tried to put it in another setup it was not working,is hooks are setup dependent?
10:07 < jardineworks_:#liferay> goku_, They shouldn't be -- same version of Liferay?
10:09 < goku_:#liferay> jardineworks_, yea same setup(clones)
10:09 < goku_:#liferay> jardineworks_, am using liferay_6.2.0
10:11 < jardineworks_:#liferay> goku_, what kind of hooks are they? JSP hooks?
10:12 < douglascrp:#liferay> I'm using form-navigator, and I see it shows on the form if there is changes to be saved
10:12 < douglascrp:#liferay> is there any way I can check for this "is changed" information using the request object into the portlet class?
