03:29 < goku_:#liferay> hi ,am getting one long urls while trying access the liferay setup ,and the browser shows the error as this page isn't redirecting properly,how to resolve this issue?
05:43 < winem_:#liferay> morning
05:52 < winem_:#liferay> we have an issue with two sites in liferay. the first one is broken but this is used as "main site". so it says " This site is inactive. Please contact the administrator. " when I access 192.168.10.93:8080
05:52 < winem_:#liferay> how do I choose another site to be shown when this URL is called?
06:40 < winem_:#liferay> ignore it, it's fixed :)
08:12 < winem_:#liferay> and another obviously stupid question, but both of my frontend developers are ill today... where can I import the war files for the theme and layout templates? I have to move an existing page to two new instances
08:17 < winem_:#liferay> can't imagine that I have to deploy them on the filesystem. I guess there is some function in the control panel, too
08:20 < winem_:#liferay> ok, got it.. did not know that I have to do it in the app panel.. thought this was for liferay apps only :)
09:18 < Bilou:#liferay> Hi all
09:20 < Bilou:#liferay> What are the bests framework to develop webservices producer and develop consumer in liferay
09:26 < jardineworks_:#liferay> Bilou, when you say producer, do you mean people calling the portal to access data that it houses?
09:29 < Bilou:#liferay> No i have to develop webservices producer and call services within my portal
09:38 < Bilou:#liferay> jardineworks_,   No i have to develop webservices producer alone  and call services within my portal using some known performant liferay plugins CE
09:38 < Bilou:#liferay> If exists
09:39 < Bilou:#liferay> jardineworks_,  have an idea ?
09:39 -!- mode/#liferay [+o jhf] by ChanServ
09:39 < Bilou:#liferay> jardineworks_,  have u an idea ?
09:40 < jardineworks_:#liferay> Bilou, So you are developing a separate set of web services and then using your Liferay plugins you want to make calls to those services -- is that it?
10:04 < goku_:#liferay> Hi, in liferay when i tried to use hooks ,its working on the setup from which i copied the original jsps ,but when i tried to put it in another setup it was not working,is hooks are setup dependent?
10:07 < jardineworks_:#liferay> goku_, They shouldn't be -- same version of Liferay?
10:09 < goku_:#liferay> jardineworks_, yea same setup(clones)
10:09 < goku_:#liferay> jardineworks_, am using liferay_6.2.0
10:11 < jardineworks_:#liferay> goku_, what kind of hooks are they? JSP hooks?
10:12 < douglascrp:#liferay> I'm using form-navigator, and I see it shows on the form if there is changes to be saved
10:12 < douglascrp:#liferay> is there any way I can check for this "is changed" information using the request object into the portlet class?
10:13 < douglascrp:#liferay> does anyone know if that info is sent to the server?
10:13 < goku_:#liferay> jardineworks_,yea i was changing the jsp for taglibs
10:25 < jardineworks_:#liferay> douglascrp, not sure about that but I want to say no. I think that "changed" state is just for the client side.
10:25 < jardineworks_:#liferay> goku_, if you go into the webapps/ROOT/html ...
10:25 < jardineworks_:#liferay> do you see your JSP there?
10:25 < douglascrp:#liferay> jardineworks_, that's what I thought
10:26 < douglascrp:#liferay> jardineworks_, but are there any best practices for this? my form is huge, and I don't know how to detect if I have to take any action (if data was changed or not)
10:27 < jardineworks_:#liferay> douglascrp, hmm...
10:29 < jardineworks_:#liferay> douglascrp, I'm not aware of any best practices per say. the only thing I can think of would be something like a hidden field that records which items are changed? or omit the SAVE button altogether and use AJAX in conjunction with onChange events?
10:29 < douglascrp:#liferay> jardineworks_, look... I got this on the form submition
10:29 < douglascrp:#liferay> _projetos_WAR_submissaoprojetosportlet_modifiedSections:,_projetos_WAR_submissaoprojetosportlet_Detalhes
10:29 < jardineworks_:#liferay> oh cool!
10:29 < jardineworks_:#liferay> maybe you can! :)
10:30 < douglascrp:#liferay> let me try changing another section
10:33 < jardineworks_:#liferay> douglascrp, and if you change more than one? does it comma separate them?
10:36 < goku_:#liferay> jardineworks_sry..i was out...so you were saying?
10:37 < goku_:#liferay> jardineworks_,yea its getting deployed,successfully and some.portal.jsp is generated for old one .
10:37 < jardineworks_:#liferay> goku_, cache maybe?
10:37 < jardineworks_:#liferay> this tomcat?
10:38 < goku_:#liferay> jardineworks_,no jboss-as-7
10:38 < douglascrp:#liferay> _projetos_WAR_submissaoprojetosportlet_modifiedSections:,_projetos_WAR_submissaoprojetosportlet_Detalhes,_projetos_WAR_submissaoprojetosportlet_Proponente
10:38 < douglascrp:#liferay> jardineworks_, yes... it is
10:39 < Bilou:#liferay> jardineworks_, Sorry I'm back.About your Question  (Bilou, So you are developing a separate set of web services and then using your Liferay plugins you want to make calls to those services -- is that it?) My answer is YES thas is what we wont to do.
10:39 < jardineworks_:#liferay> goku_, I don't know anything about jboss... but I would try stopping the server and clearing the "work and temp" folders ... whatever they are on JBoss
10:39 < jardineworks_:#liferay> douglascrp, \o/ that's cool!
10:39 < jardineworks_:#liferay> I never knew that
10:40 < goku_:#liferay> jardineworks_,hm..ohk
10:41 < jardineworks_:#liferay> Bilou, SOAP services I suppose since you are referencing consumers and producers
10:41 < jardineworks_:#liferay> goku_, its a long shot but I have seen it in the past ... either that or try changing the JSP file directly on the server (your hook one) and see if the change shows up
10:42 < jardineworks_:#liferay> goku_, and just to check.. your "clone" .. you are moving from JBoss to JBoss?
10:42 < goku_:#liferay> jardineworks_, am making the exact same copy of the jboss setup with db
10:43 < Bilou:#liferay> jardineworks_,  SOAP Services is a performant plugin (apps) developed by the community or Liferay API?
10:44 < jardineworks_:#liferay> Bilou, Not sure I understand. I was referring to a TYPE of web service. Web service is a pretty generic term but doesn't describe the method of use. Produce and Consumer is normally a term (at least from my experience) that is used when referring to SOAP based services. But you could also write REST services... Liferay has JSON services as well for example.
10:46 < jardineworks_:#liferay> Bilou, either way, I don't think there is any "standard" to use... you can use whatever. For my own, I typically use Axis for SOAP services, though it has been a long time since I have done one of those. Most of the services I have used recently have been REST services and there are piles of frameworks out there for those.
10:46 < jardineworks_:#liferay> If you are wiring them to portlets, there is a concept of Restlets that you might want to look into.
10:46 < jardineworks_:#liferay> assuming you are using rest.
10:46 < jardineworks_:#liferay> Bilou, ... put it this way, are you starting with a WSDL file?
10:47 < jardineworks_:#liferay> goku_, hmm that is odd. What happens if you undeploy the hook from your new instance and then redeploy it?
10:48 < goku_:#liferay> jardineworks_, i haven't tried that
10:48 < goku_:#liferay> jardineworks_, i heared about clustering but..i don't know much about it
10:50 < jardineworks_:#liferay> goku_, the new environment is clustered?
10:51 < goku_:#liferay> jardineworks_, no no..i mean to say liferay clustering
10:51 < goku_:#liferay> jardineworks_, do we have the option for clustering the liferay instances?
10:53 < winem_:#liferay> a quick question... can I remove the "- Liferay<portal-name>"  from the html title? so that "company - LiferayPortalxyz" becomes "company" only?
10:59 < jardineworks_:#liferay> goku_, yep -- but the clustering for Liferay only affects the cache (non-jsp .. entity cache) and the lucene indexing.
11:00 < goku_:#liferay> jardineworks_, ok
11:03 < jardineworks_:#liferay> winem_, yep -- in code :)
11:04 < jardineworks_:#liferay> winem_, PortalUtil.setPageTitle I think it is
11:04 < winem_:#liferay> is it hard to find? I renamed the portal to Welcome.. not nice, but the page is online and my boss is happy.. and this is by far not the dirtiest workaround I had to do today
11:05 < winem_:#liferay> ok, well tell it our frontend developers tomorrow
11:05 < jardineworks_:#liferay> winem_, it might be in a recource bundle... try searching the Language.properties file for Liferay Portal and see what comes out
