09:22 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Hi guys.
09:22 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Can one of you explain to me how I would use /api/jsonws/journalarticle/get-article-content when I have to supply a themeDisplay?
09:23 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I have no clue where I would obtain that.
10:01 < modd_:#liferay> well jhf, a blog post about content sharing (you did see my screenshots, didn't you?) would be great! ;)
10:02 <@jhf:#liferay> modd_:  where are the screenshots :)
10:03 <@jhf:#liferay> I will do one. I'm supposed to do a WCM webinar on wednesday but it's going to be pretty high level, because it's meant to be something that even sales people could repeat in the future :)
10:03 <@jhf:#liferay> but I'm going to start a series of deeply technical 1 hour developer focus google hangouts very soon. this would be a perfect subject.
10:04 < modd_:#liferay> the screenshots are these files, I've uploaded to liferay.com into the doclib
10:04 < modd_:#liferay> btw, the date for our webinar is the 18th, afaik
10:08 < modd_:#liferay> record your hangouts and upload it to youtube afterwards ;)
10:09 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah. I'm gonna use Google Hangouts On Air so that will automatically happen :)
10:09 <@jhf:#liferay> and will use this channel, or another IRC channel, for realtime chat
10:14 < modd_:#liferay> g2g, will be online later again...
10:31 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> *sigh* Holy f***.
10:31 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> We just went live with our new setup and all of a sudden I can't open "Site Pages" any more.
10:31 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Why...? :-/
10:31 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Liferay hates me.
10:53 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Weird.
10:53 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> This is tied to my account. Oo
10:53 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> All my colleagues have no problem and when I use a different account, it works as well. Oo
