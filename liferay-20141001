04:48 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> hi there
04:49 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> can someone confirm me that libs in barebone.js are not forced to be included in everything.js ?
04:50 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> I added some js libs in the barebone.js file, as I want those libs to be accessible for users not loggued. But I want those libs to be accessible for loggued users too. And it seems everything.js does not include the libs configured for barebone.js. right ?
