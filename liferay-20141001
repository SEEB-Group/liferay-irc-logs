04:48 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> hi there
04:49 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> can someone confirm me that libs in barebone.js are not forced to be included in everything.js ?
04:50 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> I added some js libs in the barebone.js file, as I want those libs to be accessible for users not loggued. But I want those libs to be accessible for loggued users too. And it seems everything.js does not include the libs configured for barebone.js. right ?
04:57 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> And what is loaded first ? Libs (<script type="js" src="">) in the theme (in portal_normal.vm by example), or libs in top_js.jspf from portal ?
05:08 < vernaillen:#liferay> after an upgrade from 6.0.6 to 6.2.1 the user indexer fails because there are many Contact, Phone and Address records that are not linked to a User. Would it be safe to delete these records from the database?
05:09 < vernaillen:#liferay> I also described the issue here: https://www.liferay.com/community/forums/-/message_boards/message/41883417
06:39 < goku_:#liferay> jardineworks_,hi the issue resolved :)
07:36 < aqquadro:#liferay> hi there, there is any way to send email notification when an admin reset a password from the control panel?
08:12 < douglascrp:#liferay> morning
08:50 < jardineworks_:#liferay> aqquadro, you could probably write a struts action hook that would extend the existing functionality and do that.
08:54 < aqquadro:#liferay> jardineworks_: thanks !! You know which is the path of the struct action?
08:55 < jardineworks_:#liferay> aqquadro, this is for the user edit screen in the control panel right?
08:56 < aqquadro:#liferay> jardineworks_:
08:56 < aqquadro:#liferay> ops
08:56 < aqquadro:#liferay> :D
08:57 < aqquadro:#liferay> yes, i think it is
08:57 < jardineworks_:#liferay> checking...
08:58 < jardineworks_:#liferay> hmmm
08:59 < jardineworks_:#liferay> there is an UpdatePasswordAction class that is linked to /portal/update_password -- but I wonder if that is maybe for the screen where the user changes their own password.
08:59 < jardineworks_:#liferay> the admin screen uses a form-navigator... so all those pages are really just one form with a bunch of layers.
08:59 < jardineworks_:#liferay> EditUserAction would be my guess.
09:00 < jardineworks_:#liferay> aqquadro, try this one --
09:00 < jardineworks_:#liferay> 		<action path="/admin_server/edit_user" type="com.liferay.portlet.usersadmin.action.EditUserAction">
09:00 < jardineworks_:#liferay> 			<forward name="portlet.users_admin.edit_user" path="portlet.directory.view_user" />
09:00 < jardineworks_:#liferay> 			<forward name="portlet.users_admin.error" path="portlet.directory.error" />
09:00 < jardineworks_:#liferay> 		</action>
09:00 < jardineworks_:#liferay> with a breakpoint and see if it stops :)
09:01 < aqquadro:#liferay> uhm, but if I use UserLocalServiceUtil.updatePassword is invoked the same?
09:02 < aqquadro:#liferay> (actually when I use this method the mail is't send, right because the functionality there isn't)
09:03 < jardineworks_:#liferay> oh!
09:03 < jardineworks_:#liferay> aqquadro, then you probably want a ServiceHook
09:04 < jardineworks_:#liferay> create a class that extends UserLocalServiceWrapper... then override the method. Do a super.updatePassword() first, and then when that method returns, send your mail.
09:04 < aqquadro:#liferay> uhhh! Hooking the UserLocalServiceUtil.updatePassword?
09:04 < aqquadro:#liferay> yeah
09:05 < jardineworks_:#liferay> aqquadro, https://www.liferay.com/documentation/liferay-portal/6.0/development/-/ai/overriding-a-portal-service
09:05 < jardineworks_:#liferay> still applicable to 6.2 of course
09:06 < aqquadro:#liferay> oook!
09:06 < aqquadro:#liferay> many thanks
09:19 < Bilou:#liferay> Hi guys,
09:20 < Bilou:#liferay> I want to now wich reponsive design theme mostly used in liferay comunity
09:20 < Bilou:#liferay> which
09:21 < Bilou:#liferay> please I need help
09:22 < Bilou:#liferay> nicolas_FR,  are u here ?
09:23 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> yes
09:29 < jardineworks_:#liferay> Bilou, I would guess that most people try to leverage the one that ships with 6.2 ... Bootstrap 2.6 or something I think
09:29 < jardineworks_:#liferay> but there is nothing preventing you from using whatever you want of course -- just start with a theme that is based on the _unstyled and you can apply whatever logic you like.
09:30 < jardineworks_:#liferay> foundation was the one we used on my last big project.
09:31 < Bilou:#liferay> Okey thank you jardineworks_
11:13 < douglascrp:#liferay> jardineworks_, hey dude
11:13 < douglascrp:#liferay> I'm going to try to implement the form navigator part now
11:14 < douglascrp:#liferay> may I have each of section working on a specific entity?
11:14 < douglascrp:#liferay> the first one, project, and the second one, contact?
11:14 < douglascrp:#liferay> both related?
11:21 < jardineworks_:#liferay> douglascrp, hmm... well, really you are submitting one form right? so you would need to basically I guess check for differences and then save accordingly.
11:21 < jardineworks_:#liferay> alternatively...
11:22 < jardineworks_:#liferay> you could use specific action urls right? so rather than have one global "Save" button, but a save button in each section.
11:22 < jardineworks_:#liferay> and then each one would have a <portlet:actionURL name="<whatever entity save>" var="..."/>
11:22 < jardineworks_:#liferay> then in your portlet class you could have a method for each.
11:23 < jardineworks_:#liferay> Normally the Save button on the main page saves all the sections.
11:23 < jardineworks_:#liferay> so you can move between sections and just do one big save at the end.
11:23 < douglascrp:#liferay> ah, if I use on single form, then I can take the parameters, create the entities with the typed data, save then and relate them
11:24 < douglascrp:#liferay> if I understood it correctly, using sections, I'll have only one form, but each section will have their own fields, but still inside the main form
11:24 < douglascrp:#liferay> right?
11:24 < jardineworks_:#liferay> bingo
11:25 < douglascrp:#liferay> tks
11:25 < jardineworks_:#liferay> you should still have individual methods to save your entities though. Normally I would create, in your case, an action method for full callbacks, and then inside there call a private void _saveProjeto( PortletReques portletRequest, PortletResponse portletResponse) method.
11:26 < jardineworks_:#liferay> that would allow you to call using ActionRequest, RenderRequest or ResourceRequest (when you get all ajaxy).
11:26 < douglascrp:#liferay> hmmm... I'm afraid I didn't get the idea
11:27 < douglascrp:#liferay> can you please elaborate more on the explanation?
11:27 < jardineworks_:#liferay> sure
11:27 < jardineworks_:#liferay> Action, Render and Resource requests are all child classes of a PortletRequest right?
11:27 < jardineworks_:#liferay> the data you need to "save a projeto" is in the *Request.
11:27 < douglascrp:#liferay> ok
11:28 < jardineworks_:#liferay> If you decide later on that you don't want to use portlet:actionURL anymore and you want to use ajax, then you are going to start sending RESOURCE requests.
11:28 < jardineworks_:#liferay> but at that stage, all the logic to save a projeto is in the ActionRequest handler.
11:28 < jardineworks_:#liferay> booo
11:28 < douglascrp:#liferay> I see
11:28 < jardineworks_:#liferay> so make the ActionRequest handler just an orchestrator.
11:28 < douglascrp:#liferay> got that
11:28 < douglascrp:#liferay> tks
11:29 < jardineworks_:#liferay> pass it off to a _saveProjeto with something more generic.
11:29 < jardineworks_:#liferay> and then, really, in there, you should create a projeto object and then pass it to a shared library ... like a ProjetoUtil.save( Projeto projeto ).
11:30 < jardineworks_:#liferay> that way if you ever decide to dump service builder you can change all your logic to save a projeto in the one place
11:30 < jardineworks_:#liferay> everything else remains the same
11:30 < jardineworks_:#liferay> or even if you want a separate application that has access to the lib to be able to save projetos... like a web service or somethign maybe.
11:30 < jardineworks_:#liferay> anyway, you know about all that already :)
11:30 < jardineworks_:#liferay> don't write any 150 line methods! that's what I am preaching about :)
11:32 < douglascrp:#liferay> I understand the idea, but I don't know how to apply it here... at least, not so far
11:32 < douglascrp:#liferay> but I'll try, one step at a time
11:32 < douglascrp:#liferay> first, let me try the simplest one... create those sections
14:34 < douglascrp:#liferay> jardineworks_, hey.. you around/
14:34 < douglascrp:#liferay> ?
14:35 < jardineworks_:#liferay> yep
14:37 < douglascrp:#liferay> can you take a look on what I did?
14:37 < douglascrp:#liferay> I can send the project to your email again
14:37 < douglascrp:#liferay> now my form is completely broken :D
14:38 < jardineworks_:#liferay> haha
14:38 < jardineworks_:#liferay> sure -- I need about 15 mins first though
14:38 < douglascrp:#liferay> ok, I'm packaging it now then
14:43 < douglascrp:#liferay> done...
15:16 < douglascrp:#liferay> jardineworks_, I'm rewriting it... forget that version I've just sent to you... I'm going to send this new one
15:16 < jardineworks_:#liferay> douglascrp, .. try adding showButtons="<%= false %>" after the jspPath
15:16 < douglascrp:#liferay> but first, let me try ig
15:16 < douglascrp:#liferay> it
15:23 < douglascrp:#liferay> well, I got no form rendered... let resend the project to you
