04:48 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> hi there
04:49 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> can someone confirm me that libs in barebone.js are not forced to be included in everything.js ?
04:50 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> I added some js libs in the barebone.js file, as I want those libs to be accessible for users not loggued. But I want those libs to be accessible for loggued users too. And it seems everything.js does not include the libs configured for barebone.js. right ?
04:57 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> And what is loaded first ? Libs (<script type="js" src="">) in the theme (in portal_normal.vm by example), or libs in top_js.jspf from portal ?
05:08 < vernaillen:#liferay> after an upgrade from 6.0.6 to 6.2.1 the user indexer fails because there are many Contact, Phone and Address records that are not linked to a User. Would it be safe to delete these records from the database?
05:09 < vernaillen:#liferay> I also described the issue here: https://www.liferay.com/community/forums/-/message_boards/message/41883417
06:39 < goku_:#liferay> jardineworks_,hi the issue resolved :)
07:36 < aqquadro:#liferay> hi there, there is any way to send email notification when an admin reset a password from the control panel?
08:12 < douglascrp:#liferay> morning
08:50 < jardineworks_:#liferay> aqquadro, you could probably write a struts action hook that would extend the existing functionality and do that.
08:54 < aqquadro:#liferay> jardineworks_: thanks !! You know which is the path of the struct action?
08:55 < jardineworks_:#liferay> aqquadro, this is for the user edit screen in the control panel right?
08:56 < aqquadro:#liferay> jardineworks_:
08:56 < aqquadro:#liferay> ops
08:56 < aqquadro:#liferay> :D
08:57 < aqquadro:#liferay> yes, i think it is
08:57 < jardineworks_:#liferay> checking...
08:58 < jardineworks_:#liferay> hmmm
08:59 < jardineworks_:#liferay> there is an UpdatePasswordAction class that is linked to /portal/update_password -- but I wonder if that is maybe for the screen where the user changes their own password.
08:59 < jardineworks_:#liferay> the admin screen uses a form-navigator... so all those pages are really just one form with a bunch of layers.
08:59 < jardineworks_:#liferay> EditUserAction would be my guess.
09:00 < jardineworks_:#liferay> aqquadro, try this one --
09:00 < jardineworks_:#liferay> 		<action path="/admin_server/edit_user" type="com.liferay.portlet.usersadmin.action.EditUserAction">
09:00 < jardineworks_:#liferay> 			<forward name="portlet.users_admin.edit_user" path="portlet.directory.view_user" />
09:00 < jardineworks_:#liferay> 			<forward name="portlet.users_admin.error" path="portlet.directory.error" />
09:00 < jardineworks_:#liferay> 		</action>
