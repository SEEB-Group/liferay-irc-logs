10:27 < g33kyboi:#liferay> anyone knows which jsp page I can override inorder to modify the page displayed when user clicks on "My Account" on the dropdown menu? I use Liferay portal 6.2.0. thank you
10:35 < jardineworks:#liferay> g33kyboi, might be /html/portlet/dockbar/view_user_panel.jspf, or one of the pages it includes
10:40 < g33kyboi:#liferay> jardineworks: that is my best guess. specifically /html/portlet/dockbar/view_user_account.jspf. Checking through the file I can only see the my-account link added and nothing more. Is there a way I can tell which page this link calls as the link is something like this: (http://localhost:8080/group/control_panel/manage?p_p_auth=wEB9syP4&p_p_id=2&p_p_lifecycle=0&p_p_state=maximized&p_p_col_id=column-1&p_p_col_count=1&doAsGroupId=10181&refererPlid=10184&controlPan
10:53 < jardineworks:#liferay> g33kyboi, hmm... well, in this case clicking my account would take you into the control panel right?
10:53 < jardineworks:#liferay> are you trying to prevent that?
10:55 < g33kyboi:#liferay> yes it takes me to control panel. I do not want to prevent it. All I want to do is to customized the page that it will display....I have my own user object different from liferay user, so I want to display the properties in my user object not liferay user's properties.
10:59 < jardineworks:#liferay> g33kyboi, oh I see... so you want the JSP override the CONTROL panel page.
10:59 < jardineworks:#liferay> I think I know where that is... gimme a minute
10:59 < jardineworks:#liferay> (just finishing another note)
11:00 < g33kyboi:#liferay> oh, thanks... I'll wait for you.
11:02 < jardineworks:#liferay> g33kyboi, just to make sure I understand -- you're logged in, you click on your name and then you choose "My Account" from the drop down which opens a modal. Is that what you are after?
11:04 < g33kyboi:#liferay> jardineworks, yes. I am after customizing that modal
11:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> hmm
11:05 < g33kyboi:#liferay> what do you think?
11:06 < jardineworks:#liferay> g33kyboi, it seems to start with /html/portal/layout/view/common.jspf ... because I can see a form with a name="hrefFm"
11:07 < jardineworks:#liferay> something must be injected into there dynamically.
11:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> p_p_id=2 ...
11:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> maybe -- /html/portlet/my_account/
11:11 < jardineworks:#liferay>  .../html/portlet/users_admin/edit_user.jsp is ultimately what it loads
11:12 < g33kyboi:#liferay> jardineworks, Thank you. My account portlet has the id=2. That I know already but when I go through the files in there didn't see much
11:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> so if you change the /html/portlet/my_account/view.jsp then I think the modal will show your version
11:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> it looks like it just does some includes and ultimately loads the control panel admin one
11:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> I don't think you want to hook that one though right?
11:13 < jardineworks:#liferay> you want to maintain Liferays users editor... but provide a special one for logged in users is what I am guessing
11:13 < jardineworks:#liferay> So I would try a hello world for /html/portlet/my_account/view.jsp first...
11:13 < g33kyboi:#liferay> I want to maintain Liferay's users editor.
11:14 < jardineworks:#liferay> right
11:15 < jardineworks:#liferay> so if you hook /html/portlet/my_account/view.jsp and put your logic in... then you will leave the /admin/edit_user.jsp alone.
11:16 < g33kyboi:#liferay> Thank you jardineworks.
11:16 < jardineworks:#liferay> thanks me only if it works lol :)
11:16 < g33kyboi:#liferay> lol :D
11:16 < g33kyboi:#liferay> your time is worth much more than thanks!
11:17 < g33kyboi:#liferay> worths*
11:17 < jardineworks:#liferay> happy to help
