10:27 < g33kyboi:#liferay> anyone knows which jsp page I can override inorder to modify the page displayed when user clicks on "My Account" on the dropdown menu? I use Liferay portal 6.2.0. thank you
10:35 < jardineworks:#liferay> g33kyboi, might be /html/portlet/dockbar/view_user_panel.jspf, or one of the pages it includes
10:40 < g33kyboi:#liferay> jardineworks: that is my best guess. specifically /html/portlet/dockbar/view_user_account.jspf. Checking through the file I can only see the my-account link added and nothing more. Is there a way I can tell which page this link calls as the link is something like this: (http://localhost:8080/group/control_panel/manage?p_p_auth=wEB9syP4&p_p_id=2&p_p_lifecycle=0&p_p_state=maximized&p_p_col_id=column-1&p_p_col_count=1&doAsGroupId=10181&refererPlid=10184&controlPan
10:53 < jardineworks:#liferay> g33kyboi, hmm... well, in this case clicking my account would take you into the control panel right?
10:53 < jardineworks:#liferay> are you trying to prevent that?
10:55 < g33kyboi:#liferay> yes it takes me to control panel. I do not want to prevent it. All I want to do is to customized the page that it will display....I have my own user object different from liferay user, so I want to display the properties in my user object not liferay user's properties.
10:59 < jardineworks:#liferay> g33kyboi, oh I see... so you want the JSP override the CONTROL panel page.
10:59 < jardineworks:#liferay> I think I know where that is... gimme a minute
