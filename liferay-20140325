05:30 < hufg:#liferay> helloo helloo
05:32 < hufg:#liferay> someone who is deep in the liferay game https://issues.liferay.com/browse/LPS-42402 there is not much info there
05:33 < hufg:#liferay> the symptom is identified through ui dialog butt butt could it be that in 6.1 also the range is ignored or there is some insane inefficiency handling the discarding of already published stuff
05:34 < hufg:#liferay> because as far as i remember using "last published date" as range will result into serious r/w in /tmp even though you make minor modifications ie. single article single document libraray addition
05:34 < hufg:#liferay> and it's slooow
05:36 < hufg:#liferay> seems to me that it's like --> dump everything on disk -> parse files -> get published data -> import
05:36 < hufg:#liferay> not like -> make db query -> create import -> import
13:08 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Hey guys. Anyone around? Did you ever encounter that a hook is not deployed correctly?
