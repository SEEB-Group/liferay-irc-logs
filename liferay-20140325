05:30 < hufg:#liferay> helloo helloo
05:32 < hufg:#liferay> someone who is deep in the liferay game https://issues.liferay.com/browse/LPS-42402 there is not much info there
05:33 < hufg:#liferay> the symptom is identified through ui dialog butt butt could it be that in 6.1 also the range is ignored or there is some insane inefficiency handling the discarding of already published stuff
05:34 < hufg:#liferay> because as far as i remember using "last published date" as range will result into serious r/w in /tmp even though you make minor modifications ie. single article single document libraray addition
05:34 < hufg:#liferay> and it's slooow
05:36 < hufg:#liferay> seems to me that it's like --> dump everything on disk -> parse files -> get published data -> import
05:36 < hufg:#liferay> not like -> make db query -> create import -> import
13:08 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Hey guys. Anyone around? Did you ever encounter that a hook is not deployed correctly?
13:09 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> We have a hook that modified the top_head.jsp and from time to time it just doesn't get applied correctly. It shows up as being installed, but the top_head.jsp is not changed correctly.
18:01 < Naenyn:#liferay> When adding an external CAS-based auth'n system.. and wanting to keep the existing users in Liferay functional.. assuming the same users exist in the CAS-based system, what is the recommended approach to update liferay such that SSO'ing from CAS will provide Liferay with the right values such that Liferay can figure out what user is logging in?
18:01 < Naenyn:#liferay> The customized CAS system I'll be integrating with provides a restful SOLR search that could be used to get user data.. and update Liferay's users with that data.. for instance.
18:02 < Naenyn:#liferay> I'm just wondering if there is a better way to do it on the fly at login time..
