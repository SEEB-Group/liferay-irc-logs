08:00 < noctua_:#liferay> Hello ... I am trying YUI for Liferay to show multiple modals. The goal is to write a freemarker code to show only videos in the medialibrary. I tryied to use liferay stuff but it didn't work, now i try to build it myselfe with YUI. The problem is that i cant open multiple modals. here is my code so far, maybe you can help?  http://jsfiddle.net/otnvkwuf/1/
08:01 < noctua_:#liferay> I don't have a problem to open multiple modals, i have the problem to open different videos for each modal ^^ sorry
11:24 < NutsPT:#liferay> hi guys
11:24 < NutsPT:#liferay> jardineworks: can you help please?
11:29 < NutsPT:#liferay> anyone of you guys can help with lucene?
11:31 < jardineworks:#liferay> NutsPT, sorry -- kinda swamped today
11:32 < jardineworks:#liferay> fire off your question though and I;ll try to help later if I free up some time
11:48 < NutsPT:#liferay> Ok so it’s the same scenario: 301MB DB and DL off 1,9GB - Massive syncronization tha leads to index…
11:48 < NutsPT:#liferay> It’s optimized now with
11:49 < NutsPT:#liferay> # Set Lucene's buffer size in megabytes. Higher numbers mean indexing goes
11:49 < NutsPT:#liferay> # faster but uses more memory.
11:49 < NutsPT:#liferay> lucene.buffer.size=512
11:49 < NutsPT:#liferay> #
11:49 < NutsPT:#liferay> # Set Lucene's merge factor. Higher numbers mean indexing goes faster but
11:49 < NutsPT:#liferay> # uses more memory. The default value from Lucene is 10. This should never
11:49 < NutsPT:#liferay> # be set to a number lower than 2.
11:49 < NutsPT:#liferay> lucene.merge.factor=60
11:49 < NutsPT:#liferay> #
11:49 < NutsPT:#liferay> # These properties allow commits in batch, you can either set how many document changes a batch will contain
11:49 < NutsPT:#liferay> # (commit will happen after X docs are modified) or set a time interval in milliseconds (commit will happen
11:49 < NutsPT:#liferay> # every X milliseconds).
11:49 < NutsPT:#liferay> lucene.commit.batch.size=2000
11:49 < NutsPT:#liferay> lucene.commit.time.interval=60000
11:50 < NutsPT:#liferay> the last two make the server to get is process stuck when stope
11:50 < NutsPT:#liferay> dtoped
18:01 < xirdneh:#liferay> Hi there. I just downloaded the Liferay Dev Studio and I'm trying to fire up the server on my machine but I'm getting some Null Pointer Exceptions. I am running it on an ARchLinux using jdk-8. Any ideas how to tackle this? Thanks
18:11 < bijoo_:#liferay> xirdneh: I don't think Java 8 is supported (at least not for 6.2 or below)
18:12 < bijoo_:#liferay> xirdneh: although docs just say 5 or lower's bad
18:12 < bijoo_:#liferay> xirdneh: so nothing stating 8 shouldn't work there
18:13 < bijoo_:#liferay> xirdneh: http://pastebin.com/
18:13 < bijoo_:#liferay> xirdneh: please paste the error on pastebin and show
18:57 < xirdneh:#liferay> bijoo: Ok, so apparently my DB config was messed up. I'm getting some new error.
19:07 < bijoo_:#liferay> xirdneh: please paste the pastebin otherwise it's hard
19:15 < bijoo_:#liferay> noctua: You can achieve this with the below code:
19:15 < bijoo_:#liferay> http://jsfiddle.net/2gv1tn1c/
19:15 < bijoo_:#liferay> noctua_:*
19:15 < bijoo_:#liferay> noctua_: it shows for two modals; but can do more as well.
19:26 < xirdneh:#liferay> bijoo_: Alright, I got it working. I am still getting some errors but the server is up and running so I'm debugging the rest. Thanks, tho.
19:27 < bijoo_:#liferay> xirdneh: okay; I still don't know since this too vague.
19:33 < xirdneh:#liferay> bijoo_: Yeah, I just didn't want to send the pastebins until I was sure I needed some more help. Thanks
19:34 < bijoo_:#liferay> xirdneh: anytime; feel free to ask your question. People check the chat logs and reply soon.
