11:24 < NutsPT:#liferay> hi guys
11:24 < NutsPT:#liferay> jardineworks: can you help please?
11:29 < NutsPT:#liferay> anyone of you guys can help with lucene?
11:31 < jardineworks:#liferay> NutsPT, sorry -- kinda swamped today
11:32 < jardineworks:#liferay> fire off your question though and I;ll try to help later if I free up some time
11:48 < NutsPT:#liferay> Ok so it’s the same scenario: 301MB DB and DL off 1,9GB - Massive syncronization tha leads to index…
11:48 < NutsPT:#liferay> It’s optimized now with
11:49 < NutsPT:#liferay> # Set Lucene's buffer size in megabytes. Higher numbers mean indexing goes
11:49 < NutsPT:#liferay> # faster but uses more memory.
11:49 < NutsPT:#liferay> lucene.buffer.size=512
11:49 < NutsPT:#liferay> #
11:49 < NutsPT:#liferay> # Set Lucene's merge factor. Higher numbers mean indexing goes faster but
11:49 < NutsPT:#liferay> # uses more memory. The default value from Lucene is 10. This should never
11:49 < NutsPT:#liferay> # be set to a number lower than 2.
11:49 < NutsPT:#liferay> lucene.merge.factor=60
