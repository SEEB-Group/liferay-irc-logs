03:43 < modd_:#liferay> hey topolik. can you tell me where the permissions for new files are set? I can't find it at the moment.
03:43 < topolik:#liferay> hi modd_
03:44 < topolik:#liferay> IMHO unless you specify some unique permissions they are inherited
03:44 < modd_:#liferay> I have a case where a user creates a new file but the site member view default permission is not set while doing it as admin everything is ok
03:45 < modd_:#liferay> inheritance in liferay is hard to call "inheritance" ;p
03:45 < topolik:#liferay> I know
03:45 < topolik:#liferay> do you think it's a bug?
03:46 < topolik:#liferay> I mean the permissions, not inheritance :)
