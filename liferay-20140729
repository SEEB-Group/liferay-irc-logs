10:27 < dave_k:#liferay> hey all ... we're experiencing cpu hog problems when connecting to a liferay instance using remote ide connector/server-manager-web (196% cpu on a 2core machine). any hints on how to mitigate that?
10:27 < dave_k:#liferay> (oh... hey olafk! hier ist @anathem ;)
10:29 < olafk:#liferay> Quick help: Do a few ThreadDumps and check where it stuck. Hi dave_k
10:29 < olafk:#liferay> (I'm currently following on #liferay-dev-life)
10:33 < dave_k:#liferay> olafk: the ThreadDumps I did didn't help in the past...
10:47 < olafk:#liferay> dave_k: try them now. I'm close, and whenever I'm close and take a look, problems magically go away
10:51 < dave_k:#liferay> olafk: :)
