10:27 < dave_k:#liferay> hey all ... we're experiencing cpu hog problems when connecting to a liferay instance using remote ide connector/server-manager-web (196% cpu on a 2core machine). any hints on how to mitigate that?
10:27 < dave_k:#liferay> (oh... hey olafk! hier ist @anathem ;)
10:29 < olafk:#liferay> Quick help: Do a few ThreadDumps and check where it stuck. Hi dave_k
10:29 < olafk:#liferay> (I'm currently following on #liferay-dev-life)
10:33 < dave_k:#liferay> olafk: the ThreadDumps I did didn't help in the past...
10:47 < olafk:#liferay> dave_k: try them now. I'm close, and whenever I'm close and take a look, problems magically go away
10:51 < dave_k:#liferay> olafk: :)
10:57 < jrmiah:#liferay> are all JDBC databases supported out of the box?
10:58 < jrmiah:#liferay> on a fresh install?
11:01 < olafk:#liferay> jrmiah: Many, but you will need the driver. Are you looking for a particular one?
11:01 < jrmiah:#liferay> sql server ...
11:01 < olafk:#liferay> yup. Let me look up the supported versions
11:01 < jrmiah:#liferay> think I know where the drive is, just checking to make sure that liferay populates the schema itself regardless of DB
11:01 < jrmiah:#liferay> driver*
11:02 < olafk:#liferay> yes, it does. Proper permissions given, of course
11:02 < jrmiah:#liferay> so more about how LifeRay manages the databases, I guess
11:02 < jrmiah:#liferay> yeah, sure. Guess just need to test it :)
11:02 < olafk:#liferay> you can download the sql file separately, but it's most comfortable if you just provide proper DDL permissions. You can remove the DDL permissions after installation, might need it during upgrades
11:05 < olafk:#liferay> jrmiah: 2005, 2008 (also R2) and 2012 should all be working
11:08 < jrmiah:#liferay> very nice, will try it out.
11:08 < jrmiah:#liferay> still have had 0 luck building from source on 8 different variations ... mac osx, windows, linux and different flavors of Ant and the JDK on all of them ..
11:09 < jrmiah:#liferay> that said had a thought ... we might be able to demonstrate what we need from source by building a 'hello world' portlet for liferay...

11:14 < jrmiah:#liferay> how hard is it to bring a portlet into liferay and view it? consider a development lifecycle ... change some code, build the portlet, redeploy it..
11:49 < olafk:#liferay> jrmiah: The basic portlet is a matter of seconds. The rest is as complex as any web application that you develop, i.e. the answer is "it depends"
11:50 < olafk:#liferay> redeploying typically also is a matter of seconds. Might depend on the appserver of your choice, but tomcat typically is really development friendly
