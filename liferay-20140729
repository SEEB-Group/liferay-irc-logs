10:27 < dave_k:#liferay> hey all ... we're experiencing cpu hog problems when connecting to a liferay instance using remote ide connector/server-manager-web (196% cpu on a 2core machine). any hints on how to mitigate that?
10:27 < dave_k:#liferay> (oh... hey olafk! hier ist @anathem ;)
10:29 < olafk:#liferay> Quick help: Do a few ThreadDumps and check where it stuck. Hi dave_k
10:29 < olafk:#liferay> (I'm currently following on #liferay-dev-life)
10:33 < dave_k:#liferay> olafk: the ThreadDumps I did didn't help in the past...
10:47 < olafk:#liferay> dave_k: try them now. I'm close, and whenever I'm close and take a look, problems magically go away
10:51 < dave_k:#liferay> olafk: :)
10:57 < jrmiah:#liferay> are all JDBC databases supported out of the box?
10:58 < jrmiah:#liferay> on a fresh install?
11:01 < olafk:#liferay> jrmiah: Many, but you will need the driver. Are you looking for a particular one?
11:01 < jrmiah:#liferay> sql server ...
11:01 < olafk:#liferay> yup. Let me look up the supported versions
11:01 < jrmiah:#liferay> think I know where the drive is, just checking to make sure that liferay populates the schema itself regardless of DB
11:01 < jrmiah:#liferay> driver*
11:02 < olafk:#liferay> yes, it does. Proper permissions given, of course
11:02 < jrmiah:#liferay> so more about how LifeRay manages the databases, I guess
11:02 < jrmiah:#liferay> yeah, sure. Guess just need to test it :)
11:02 < olafk:#liferay> you can download the sql file separately, but it's most comfortable if you just provide proper DDL permissions. You can remove the DDL permissions after installation, might need it during upgrades
11:05 < olafk:#liferay> jrmiah: 2005, 2008 (also R2) and 2012 should all be working
11:08 < jrmiah:#liferay> very nice, will try it out.
11:08 < jrmiah:#liferay> still have had 0 luck building from source on 8 different variations ... mac osx, windows, linux and different flavors of Ant and the JDK on all of them ..
11:09 < jrmiah:#liferay> that said had a thought ... we might be able to demonstrate what we need from source by building a 'hello world' portlet for liferay...
11:13 -!- mode/#liferay [+o lundgren] by ChanServ
11:14 < jrmiah:#liferay> how hard is it to bring a portlet into liferay and view it? consider a development lifecycle ... change some code, build the portlet, redeploy it..
11:49 < olafk:#liferay> jrmiah: The basic portlet is a matter of seconds. The rest is as complex as any web application that you develop, i.e. the answer is "it depends"
11:50 < olafk:#liferay> redeploying typically also is a matter of seconds. Might depend on the appserver of your choice, but tomcat typically is really development friendly
11:51 < olafk:#liferay> dave_k: Any updates?
11:55 < dave_k:#liferay> olafk: yes. The ThreadDump didn't help (where in there is the data that tells me which thread is the culprit??) and the CPU Hog went away (maybe because my coworker restarted his eclipse instance).
11:56 < olafk:#liferay> dave_k: You'll take multiple thread dumps, compare them and check if you find similarities, and threads that are not waiting for http requests.
11:57 < olafk:#liferay> but sounds like you found the root cause. If you can reproduce, please file an issue, include version numbers of all: server, plugins and IDE
12:00 < dave_k:#liferay> olafk: from our experiences, I assume that it's a problem that only comes up after a lot of dev work on an instance. Maybe even only after two eclipse/liferayIDE instances worked parallel on the same server (but it's lingering after that, even if only one dev connects).
12:02 < dave_k:#liferay> therefore I think I wouldn't be able to file any steps to reproduce
12:03 < olafk:#liferay> bummer
12:04 < dave_k:#liferay> yeah. and the issue tracker rules/dynamics dictate that such issues are to be closed fast...
12:06 < dave_k:#liferay> we've had this problem on multiple instances since Liferay IDE came out (a.k.a. about LR6.1 beta), but never found any steps to reproduce apart from "develop a lot via Remote IDE connector"
12:07 < npskirk:#liferay> Step 1.  Use Eclipse to run Tomcat
12:07 < npskirk:#liferay> Step 2.  There is no step 2
12:08 < npskirk:#liferay>  At least, that's been my experience
12:08 < dave_k:#liferay> npskirk: right. But that defeats the added flexibility of having a shared test instance.
12:09 < npskirk:#liferay> I'm just saying, I've found running and publishing apps to tomcat from eclipse to be entirely unreliable
