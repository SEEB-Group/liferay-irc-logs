09:59 < mojo> hi. i have a issue with asset publisher. i can't open any document listet inside of it. the page is only refreshing. anyone got a clue?
10:01 < mojo> lifrey version 6.2 ga2, tomcat 7, using guest role and link behaviour is show full content, asset publisher has not been hooked
10:19 < namredips> got a question if anyone is around. Having some issue with an account and I am just not sure how to fix. I have seached and search, maybe with the wrong search string. But at a loss.
10:21 < namredips> The issue is that for an account, administrator account, when editing the account profile screen name and password are always in the (modified) state
10:21 < namredips> so in order to make a change at all, both fields must be updated with new data. then i don’t an error
10:22 < namredips> is there someplace to change the state of those fields, seems like something is out of sync
12:25 < bijoo__> mojo: will check it out in few minutes
