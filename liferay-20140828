07:49 < Axxell:#liferay> bijoo: about the question from yesterday: the search portlet creates urls which have "&" character in it, when it should be "&amp;". Tried to use htmlutil to escape the url, but the search portlet stopped working. The searchportlet is embedded in my theme with $theme.search();
07:52 < Axxell:#liferay> bijoo: Question nr2 about cas: Cas tries to authenticate user even if file is available for all on the public site.. the url to the file is not taking in account where it is, its like: "https://xxx.xxxxx.xx/documents/52239/6350057/xxxx.docx/19016d16-d1e6-45b0-b526-9fde0027481e"
07:53 < Axxell:#liferay> bijoo: there is a portal setting to have ignore paths for cas autologin, but that would be kinda bad..
07:54 < Axxell:#liferay> bijoo: btw found another default liferay portlet which does not validate when using http://validator.w3.org/ ..the web form portlet,  it has stray label tags in it..
08:37 < Axxell:#liferay> bijoo: as far as i know the forms, like the searchform should automatically encode urls to use &amp; instead of &, but it does not on my site

09:29 < modd_:#liferay> hi jhf. got your mail, great offer!
09:29 <@jhf:#liferay> yay! any chance to join us in Darmstadt ?
09:30 < modd_:#liferay> well, check your call for paper-registrations for the devcon ;)
09:32 <@jhf:#liferay> lol.. awesome :) I’ll get you set up with registration via email
09:32 < modd_:#liferay> ;)
09:34 < Yam`:#liferay> If I want to do a page with a list of demands (displayed in a table on the left) and another table on the right with the details of one of that demand, that changes when I click a demand at the left, should I do one portlet with both things or two portlets that communicate?
09:35 < modd_:#liferay> depends...usually I would use one portlet and reload stuff with ajax requests
09:36 < modd_:#liferay> hey jhf, seeing your ajax blog entries you have to be the webservice guru of liferay, I need you ;)
09:37 < modd_:#liferay> is it possible to allow to use the webservices of my own portlet without login while all the other liferay services still need an authenticated user?
09:38 <@jhf:#liferay> modd_: funny you should ask. the answer is yes, as there is a dev.life session a week from tuesday (sept 9) that covers this very topic!!
09:39 < modd_:#liferay> :D
09:39 < modd_:#liferay> can you give me some infos in front ;)
09:39 <@jhf:#liferay> also this forum post might help: https://www.liferay.com/community/forums/-/message_boards/message/37091246
09:40 <@jhf:#liferay> (see my response on april 23)
09:40 < Yam`:#liferay> <modd_> depends...usually I would use one portlet and reload stuff with ajax requests > do you know a tutorial or an example on which I can take inspiration from?
09:40 < modd_:#liferay> currently I'm struggeling with an service specification, which I have to make work in liferay
09:40 <@jhf:#liferay> to make a guest-access JSON web service in a plugin, you must do two things:
09:40 <@jhf:#liferay> 1. declare in portal-ext.properties which paths should not be CSRF-protected (i.e. not require the p_auth token)
09:41 <@jhf:#liferay> 2. Annotate your web service implementation methods with @AccessControlled(guestAccessEnabled = true)
09:41 < modd_:#liferay> Yam`: create jsps for the content you want to reload
09:41 <@jhf:#liferay> also, in the methods that are annotated, if you call into a non-XXXXLocalServiceUtil class, it’ll fail, so be sure to check permissions and then call XXXXLocalServiceUtil
09:42 < modd_:#liferay> I don't have any local services at all :\
09:43 < modd_:#liferay> it's kind of strange
09:43 < Yam`:#liferay> modd_, but doing one portlet is the best way to do it?
09:43 < modd_:#liferay> the authentification is a key, which is send as post parameter
09:43 < modd_:#liferay> Yam`: it's less work
09:43 < modd_:#liferay> especially if you don't need any IPC, which sometimes is pretty ugly
09:43 < Yam`:#liferay> is it cleaner to do two portlets?
09:44 < modd_:#liferay> if these portlets may work without each other, than yes
09:44 < modd_:#liferay> jhf: I'll try it, hopefully it will do what I need
09:45 <@jhf:#liferay> also topolik will be the presenter at the next dev.life and also wrote a good blog post on this subject: https://www.liferay.com/web/tomas.polesovsky/blog/-/blogs/json-ws-security
09:45 < modd_:#liferay> btw: I have some issues with using the dllapp addfileentry method in .../api/jsonws (the one with the File parameter, not byte[])
09:46 < Yam`:#liferay> ok thanks modd_
09:47 < modd_:#liferay> anyway Yam`, in one portlet you would create a jsp for the content you want to reload and then do this: <portlet:resourceURL var="viewContentURL"><portlet:param name="action" value="view_content"/></portlet:resourceURL>
09:47 < modd_:#liferay> the portlet param is optional but may be usefull if you have more than one resource request
09:48 < modd_:#liferay> later you have to create onXXX events like onClick to your elements to reload the other part of the portlet
09:48 < modd_:#liferay> this you can do simply by alloy requests like this:
09:50 < modd_:#liferay> A.io.request('<%=viewContentURL %>',{method: 'POST',data: {param:val,param2:val2},on: {success: function() {var message = this.get('responseData');A.one('#idOfTheDivWhichContainsTheContent').html(message)}});
09:52 < modd_:#liferay> and in your backend class create a method public void serveResource(ResourceRequest resourceRequest, ResourceResponse resourceResponse)
09:52 < modd_:#liferay> then simply: if (action.equals("view_content")) {include("/html/" + action + ".jsp", resourceRequest, resourceResponse, PortletRequest.RESOURCE_PHASE);}
09:53 < modd_:#liferay> this will render the jsp with your parameters and give you the html output
09:53 < modd_:#liferay> which will be written in the div in your frontend
09:53 < modd_:#liferay> everything without any page reload
09:53 < Yam`:#liferay>  I keep somewhere that and I'll consider it when I write my portlet, thanks :)
09:54 < modd_:#liferay> np, I hope you can use it
