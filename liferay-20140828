07:49 < Axxell:#liferay> bijoo: about the question from yesterday: the search portlet creates urls which have "&" character in it, when it should be "&amp;". Tried to use htmlutil to escape the url, but the search portlet stopped working. The searchportlet is embedded in my theme with $theme.search();
07:52 < Axxell:#liferay> bijoo: Question nr2 about cas: Cas tries to authenticate user even if file is available for all on the public site.. the url to the file is not taking in account where it is, its like: "https://xxx.xxxxx.xx/documents/52239/6350057/xxxx.docx/19016d16-d1e6-45b0-b526-9fde0027481e"
07:53 < Axxell:#liferay> bijoo: there is a portal setting to have ignore paths for cas autologin, but that would be kinda bad..
07:54 < Axxell:#liferay> bijoo: btw found another default liferay portlet which does not validate when using http://validator.w3.org/ ..the web form portlet,  it has stray label tags in it..
08:37 < Axxell:#liferay> bijoo: as far as i know the forms, like the searchform should automatically encode urls to use &amp; instead of &, but it does not on my site

09:29 < modd_:#liferay> hi jhf. got your mail, great offer!
09:29 <@jhf:#liferay> yay! any chance to join us in Darmstadt ?
09:30 < modd_:#liferay> well, check your call for paper-registrations for the devcon ;)
09:32 <@jhf:#liferay> lol.. awesome :) Iâ€™ll get you set up with registration via email
09:32 < modd_:#liferay> ;)
09:34 < Yam`:#liferay> If I want to do a page with a list of demands (displayed in a table on the left) and another table on the right with the details of one of that demand, that changes when I click a demand at the left, should I do one portlet with both things or two portlets that communicate?
09:35 < modd_:#liferay> depends...usually I would use one portlet and reload stuff with ajax requests
09:36 < modd_:#liferay> hey jhf, seeing your ajax blog entries you have to be the webservice guru of liferay, I need you ;)
09:37 < modd_:#liferay> is it possible to allow to use the webservices of my own portlet without login while all the other liferay services still need an authenticated user?
09:38 <@jhf:#liferay> modd_: funny you should ask. the answer is yes, as there is a dev.life session a week from tuesday (sept 9) that covers this very topic!!
09:39 < modd_:#liferay> :D
09:39 < modd_:#liferay> can you give me some infos in front ;)
09:39 <@jhf:#liferay> also this forum post might help: https://www.liferay.com/community/forums/-/message_boards/message/37091246
09:40 <@jhf:#liferay> (see my response on april 23)
09:40 < Yam`:#liferay> <modd_> depends...usually I would use one portlet and reload stuff with ajax requests > do you know a tutorial or an example on which I can take inspiration from?
09:40 < modd_:#liferay> currently I'm struggeling with an service specification, which I have to make work in liferay
09:40 <@jhf:#liferay> to make a guest-access JSON web service in a plugin, you must do two things:
09:40 <@jhf:#liferay> 1. declare in portal-ext.properties which paths should not be CSRF-protected (i.e. not require the p_auth token)
09:41 <@jhf:#liferay> 2. Annotate your web service implementation methods with @AccessControlled(guestAccessEnabled = true)
