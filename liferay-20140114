04:15 < lapache:#liferay> Hello, i lost the liferay admin access because of ldap configuration. How can i set 'omni admins' in portal-ext.properties plz? i didn't find clearly how to set user:pw in this file ...
04:47 < topolik:#liferay> lapache: omniadmin.users=10154
04:47 < topolik:#liferay> exchange the userId for some existing user id
05:37 < lapache:#liferay> Thank you topolik, but the omni admin can't modify options. Liferay says "You doesn't have suffisent rights"
06:19 < topolik:#liferay> lapache: do you have just one company/portal instance or more?
06:21 < lapache:#liferay> i have one. I was searching for a couple user:password setting in the portal-ext file ...
07:37 < topolik:#liferay> lapache: what version do you use?
08:59 < sm`:#liferay> ello every1
08:59 < sm`:#liferay> i have a question... im trying to get the visitors lang in a servlet
09:00 < sm`:#liferay> i tried this so far:
09:00 < sm`:#liferay> String lang = LanguageUtil.getLanguageId(request); - doesnt return the right lang
09:01 < sm`:#liferay> and from a cookie GUEST_LANGUAGE_ID but again im not getting the right/most recent value
09:03 < sm`:#liferay> is there any way to get the themeDisplay in my servlet
09:03 < sm`:#liferay> ?
09:04 < sm`:#liferay> or maybe you have a better suggestion
09:31 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey Tar-Minyatur are you around?
09:41 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey topolik, jhf rotty3000 .. do either or you know what the DynamicCSSFilter does?
09:42 <@jhf:#liferay> doesn't that compile SASS into CSS before delivery to client?
09:42 <@jhf:#liferay> something to do with SASS.
09:42 <@jhf:#liferay> you can't disable it, I know that much
09:43 <@jhf:#liferay> I mean there is a portal.properties option to disable it, but it also blows up control panel (at least in 6.1)
09:43 <@jhf:#liferay> https://www.liferay.com/community/forums/-/message_boards/message/16130226
09:50 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, and lets say that you precompiled the css (using sass externally) before putting it into the theme
09:50 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf -- stands to reason that it might explain --

09:51 <@jhf:#liferay> yep I think Liferay depends much more heavily on that filter than one would think.
09:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> that looks like someone is trying to precompile the Liferay css
09:52 <@jhf:#liferay> I'm not sure if things are better in 6.2, issues.liferay.com is currently down :(
09:52 < jardineworks:#liferay> lol -- where do you report that? :)
09:53 <@jhf:#liferay> hahaha I thought the same thing as I was emailing the web team :)
09:53 <@jhf:#liferay> "I would have filed a ticket, but....."
10:36 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Hi guya. Time and time again I stumble upon the problem that I need to retrieve the CDN host from within a CMS VM template.
10:36 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I really should write that down where I can easily find it again.
11:37 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Maybe one of you needed something like this already: Can I somehow use Liferay to force the user on the SSL version of a certain page?
11:43 < jardineworks:#liferay> prefis the url with https? :)
12:31 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> jardineworks: Haha.
12:31 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> We have relative URLs everywhere, so the user stays on whatever http(s) he is.
12:31 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> This is ok, but for the pages containing forms we'd like to enforce SSL.
12:32 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Just wondering if Liferay can do that or if I need to set a redirect in the proxy sitting in front of Liferay.
12:55 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey rotty3000 -- are you around for a performance related question? actually monitoring more than perf...
12:57 <@rotty3000:#liferay> a bit yeah
