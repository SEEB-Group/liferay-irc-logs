04:15 < lapache:#liferay> Hello, i lost the liferay admin access because of ldap configuration. How can i set 'omni admins' in portal-ext.properties plz? i didn't find clearly how to set user:pw in this file ...
04:47 < topolik:#liferay> lapache: omniadmin.users=10154
04:47 < topolik:#liferay> exchange the userId for some existing user id
05:37 < lapache:#liferay> Thank you topolik, but the omni admin can't modify options. Liferay says "You doesn't have suffisent rights"
06:19 < topolik:#liferay> lapache: do you have just one company/portal instance or more?
06:21 < lapache:#liferay> i have one. I was searching for a couple user:password setting in the portal-ext file ...
