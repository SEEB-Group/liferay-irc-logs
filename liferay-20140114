04:15 < lapache:#liferay> Hello, i lost the liferay admin access because of ldap configuration. How can i set 'omni admins' in portal-ext.properties plz? i didn't find clearly how to set user:pw in this file ...
04:47 < topolik:#liferay> lapache: omniadmin.users=10154
04:47 < topolik:#liferay> exchange the userId for some existing user id
05:37 < lapache:#liferay> Thank you topolik, but the omni admin can't modify options. Liferay says "You doesn't have suffisent rights"
06:19 < topolik:#liferay> lapache: do you have just one company/portal instance or more?
06:21 < lapache:#liferay> i have one. I was searching for a couple user:password setting in the portal-ext file ...
07:37 < topolik:#liferay> lapache: what version do you use?
08:59 < sm`:#liferay> ello every1
08:59 < sm`:#liferay> i have a question... im trying to get the visitors lang in a servlet
09:00 < sm`:#liferay> i tried this so far:
09:00 < sm`:#liferay> String lang = LanguageUtil.getLanguageId(request); - doesnt return the right lang
09:01 < sm`:#liferay> and from a cookie GUEST_LANGUAGE_ID but again im not getting the right/most recent value
09:03 < sm`:#liferay> is there any way to get the themeDisplay in my servlet
09:03 < sm`:#liferay> ?
09:04 < sm`:#liferay> or maybe you have a better suggestion
09:31 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey Tar-Minyatur are you around?
09:41 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey topolik, jhf rotty3000 .. do either or you know what the DynamicCSSFilter does?
09:42 <@jhf:#liferay> doesn't that compile SASS into CSS before delivery to client?
09:42 <@jhf:#liferay> something to do with SASS.
09:42 <@jhf:#liferay> you can't disable it, I know that much
09:43 <@jhf:#liferay> I mean there is a portal.properties option to disable it, but it also blows up control panel (at least in 6.1)
09:43 <@jhf:#liferay> https://www.liferay.com/community/forums/-/message_boards/message/16130226
09:50 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, and lets say that you precompiled the css (using sass externally) before putting it into the theme
09:50 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf -- stands to reason that it might explain --
09:50 < jardineworks:#liferay> Errno::ENOENT: No such file or directory - /home/liferay/current/liferay/tomcat/temp/liferay/sass/872d681b648c002e43216d2221408cf0927bddd4/main.cssc

09:51 <@jhf:#liferay> yep I think Liferay depends much more heavily on that filter than one would think.
09:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> that looks like someone is trying to precompile the Liferay css
09:52 <@jhf:#liferay> I'm not sure if things are better in 6.2, issues.liferay.com is currently down :(
09:52 < jardineworks:#liferay> lol -- where do you report that? :)
09:53 <@jhf:#liferay> hahaha I thought the same thing as I was emailing the web team :)
09:53 <@jhf:#liferay> "I would have filed a ticket, but....."
10:36 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Hi guya. Time and time again I stumble upon the problem that I need to retrieve the CDN host from within a CMS VM template.
10:36 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I really should write that down where I can easily find it again.
11:37 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Maybe one of you needed something like this already: Can I somehow use Liferay to force the user on the SSL version of a certain page?
11:43 < jardineworks:#liferay> prefis the url with https? :)
12:31 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> jardineworks: Haha.
12:31 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> We have relative URLs everywhere, so the user stays on whatever http(s) he is.
12:31 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> This is ok, but for the pages containing forms we'd like to enforce SSL.
12:32 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Just wondering if Liferay can do that or if I need to set a redirect in the proxy sitting in front of Liferay.
12:55 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey rotty3000 -- are you around for a performance related question? actually monitoring more than perf...
12:57 <@rotty3000:#liferay> a bit yeah
13:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> rotty3000, I am trying to setup the server so that I can attach VisualVM to it to monitor resources. I have the jstatd running on 1099 and have opened the port in the firewall. I create the Remote host in visual vm, but nothing is showing up.
13:03 <@rotty3000:#liferay> hmm...
13:04 <@rotty3000:#liferay> I'm not familiar with jstatd usage
13:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> rotty3000, is there another way to do it?
13:05 <@rotty3000:#liferay> when I want to remote debug though I just add this:     -Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=8000
13:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> rotty3000, its less about debugging and more I need to see what's happening in the JVM. All of the sudden today we started getting out of memory issues
13:05 <@rotty3000:#liferay> as long as the firewall allows that port, then it should be a cinch in VisualVM to connect
13:06 <@rotty3000:#liferay> yeah, you can monitor the JVM resources through the debug connection
13:06 < jardineworks:#liferay> oh
13:06 < jardineworks:#liferay> so I add that to the tomcat setenv.sh?
13:06 <@rotty3000:#liferay> the instrumentation is probably as little higher for propose of debugging though
13:06 <@rotty3000:#liferay> yeah
13:06 < jardineworks:#liferay> and then how do you attach to that?
13:06 <@rotty3000:#liferay> change the port as necessary
13:07 <@rotty3000:#liferay> same type of connection in VisualVM
13:07 <@rotty3000:#liferay> .. not an expert.. I do 99.99% of my work locally
13:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> hmmm
13:10 <@rotty3000:#liferay> reading the docs...
13:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> ok -- restarting the server with that line.
13:10 <@rotty3000:#liferay> you do need jstatd to find the remote processes..
13:10 <@rotty3000:#liferay> but never used it
13:11 <@rotty3000:#liferay> I mean I've never had to do that personally
13:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> shoot
13:13 < jardineworks:#liferay> rotty3000, locally, I can see a lot of replication threads.
13:13 < jardineworks:#liferay> could that be an issue?
13:14 < jardineworks:#liferay> .. and they all appear to be sleeping
13:14 <@rotty3000:#liferay> it worked for me
13:14 <@rotty3000:#liferay> no trouble
13:14 <@rotty3000:#liferay> I just connected to my laptop from my desktop
13:16 <@rotty3000:#liferay> all I did was run sudo jstatd -J-Djava.security.policy=all.policy     (as described here http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/tools/share/jstatd.html)
13:16 <@rotty3000:#liferay> in visualvm on my desktop I added connection to my laptop, and it saw the java processes right away and let me connect to them
13:16 <@rotty3000:#liferay> cool!! learn something new every day! :)
13:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> rotty3000, hmm .. i need to do ./jstatd ... you ran it outright?
13:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> without the ./ I mean
13:21 <@rotty3000:#liferay> yeah, on Linux java is a system install app with the tools in the path already
13:22 < jardineworks:#liferay> rotty3000, I am on ubuntu ... java works from everywhere, but jstatd doesn't
13:22 <@rotty3000:#liferay> [rotty@rotty-laptop ~]$ which jstatd
13:22 <@rotty3000:#liferay> /usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-amd64/bin/jstatd
13:22 < jardineworks:#liferay> even when I am in the bin/ folder and I hit jstatd ... it comes back with command not found.
13:23 < jardineworks:#liferay> mmy which command comes back blank?!
13:23 <@rotty3000:#liferay> so you might not have the JDK completely installed correctly
13:23 < jardineworks:#liferay> which java returns usr/bin/java
13:23 < jardineworks:#liferay> so maybe I need a symlink
13:23 <@rotty3000:#liferay> uhmm..
13:23 <@rotty3000:#liferay> I wouldn't do that
13:23 <@rotty3000:#liferay> I would simply make sure that the JDK is installed correctly
13:24 < jardineworks:#liferay> this is someone elses witchcraft that I am not allowed to change.
13:24 < jardineworks:#liferay> if I run ./jstatd though ... I can see the process running
13:25 <@rotty3000:#liferay> http://i.imgur.com/MmorPUK.png
13:26 <@rotty3000:#liferay> jstatd is supposed to be part of the JDK bundle
13:26 <@rotty3000:#liferay> perhaps you are using the Oracle JDK with bad symlinks?
13:26 <@rotty3000:#liferay> however
13:26 <@rotty3000:#liferay> running it from within the JDK's own bin folder should work fine
13:26 <@rotty3000:#liferay> as long as it can find it's libs
13:27 < jardineworks:#liferay> we are using oracle.. and it is there.. It must be starting because I can see the process running right?
13:29 <@rotty3000:#liferay> then I'm out of ideas, are you sure you are granting all permissions? perhaps it has no rights to the processes you need to monitor?
13:30 <@rotty3000:#liferay> apparently it may be iptables (firewall)
13:31 < jardineworks:#liferay> sudo ufw open XXXX
13:31 < jardineworks:#liferay> thats about as much as I know :)
13:31 < jardineworks:#liferay> I have the same policy file
13:32 < jardineworks:#liferay> LR is not using the system java install... JAVA HOME is set at startup to a JDK 1.6 (oracle)... so I am starting the jstatd for that jvm
14:16 < jardineworks:#liferay> @#%$!#%$# firewall. what a waste of 2 hours.
14:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> rotty3000,  when you have a second (this is not a domain expertise for me). I finally have it attached. First thing I noticed, the tomcat jvm args have 4096 as the XmX and PermGen of 1024. The server itself has just 4096 MB RAM -- and it is hosting Liferay, the Database and a few other things. Could our issue be that the JVM is trying to gobble up more more memory -- not having reached its threshold for memory manangement and it results i
14:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> n taking it all over and not having resources to release it?
14:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> basically... the JVM just uses those flags as a ceiling right? it doesn't check to see if the memory is ACTUALLY available -- etc.
14:22 <@rotty3000:#liferay> absolutely yes you've dedicated too much memory to the JVM
14:22 < jardineworks:#liferay> I think its supposed to be set to 2048 and 512
14:23 <@rotty3000:#liferay> on server you should always dedicated a fixed sized heap that is less than the total amount of memory which is required to run the OS, other services, plus the Java App
14:23 < jardineworks:#liferay> right -- I think someone "tweaked" this not understanding what it meant maybe
14:24 <@rotty3000:#liferay> otherwise memory will become contented, and you'll see the OS swapping a lot
14:24 <@rotty3000:#liferay>  you do NOT want a server to ever use swap
14:24 < jardineworks:#liferay> makes sense
14:25 < jardineworks:#liferay> right now in the conrtrol panel I see the resources not maxed out at all.. but htop on the server shows it basically at threshold, or near it
14:26 <@rotty3000:#liferay> what resources? CPU may be low. but still have issues with memory
14:26 <@rotty3000:#liferay> what about memory?
14:26 <@rotty3000:#liferay> anyhow.. your JVM should never take up all the physical memory
14:26 < jardineworks:#liferay> the memory is not fully used either (in the control panel)
14:27 <@rotty3000:#liferay> also permgen should not be so high
14:27 < jardineworks:#liferay> but I suspect LR is trying to grab more as the application is used.
14:27 < jardineworks:#liferay> 512 too high?
14:27 <@rotty3000:#liferay> yeah
14:28 <@rotty3000:#liferay> 256 should be enough
14:28 <@rotty3000:#liferay> go up slowly from there in increments of about 32Mb if you encounter problems
14:28 <@rotty3000:#liferay> finally, set the max and min heap sizes to the same value
14:28 <@rotty3000:#liferay> so that the heap doesn't ever resize
14:29 <@rotty3000:#liferay> that will make GC much more consistent
14:29 <@rotty3000:#liferay> since it'
14:29 <@rotty3000:#liferay> it doesn't have to give/take with the system memory manager
