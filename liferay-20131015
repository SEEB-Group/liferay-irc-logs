03:51 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> is it possible to give a different welcome to each user?
03:53 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> for example: user1 should be redirected to site1, even if he/she have given www.example.com/www/site2 or www.example.com/
04:23 < hufg:#liferay> hmmmm?
05:15 < hufg:#liferay> any ideas how to render a get parameter in article? 8)
08:53 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey hufg you got a sec for a qqq?
08:53 < jardineworks:#liferay> qq*
09:13 < hufg:#liferay> hmm qq as in question? :D
09:13 < jardineworks:#liferay> qq = quick question :)
09:13 < jardineworks:#liferay> though my disclaimer is  that it might not be quick :)
09:14 < jardineworks:#liferay> I have a page called my-profile. A user should only see this page, of course, when they are logged in. So right now in my velocity template I have the is_signed_in check. That is working.
09:14 < jardineworks:#liferay> first question.
09:14 < jardineworks:#liferay> This page should be listed under the private pages right?
09:15 < jardineworks:#liferay> (so that someone can't just enter the url to get to it -- without signing in)
09:15 < hufg:#liferay> hmmm
09:17 < hufg:#liferay> yeah probably, it could also be restricted by permissions
09:17 < hufg:#liferay> what is the context of this my-profile?
09:17 < hufg:#liferay> you can have site(group) private pages, user private pages, pages restricted by permissions and so forth
09:18 < jardineworks:#liferay> my client has a separate system that stored user account information. This page will have a "my-profile" portlet on it that will allow them to update this information (via REST calls).
09:18 < jardineworks:#liferay> I  figured a user private page made the most logical sense since it is for an individual user
09:19 < jardineworks:#liferay> what I can't figure out... is how the heck to build the url in the VM template.
09:19 < hufg:#liferay> ahh yes the url building challenge in vm
09:19 < hufg:#liferay> you want to build url to the private page?
09:19 < jardineworks:#liferay> a group private page would also work since the user from the themedisplay is what will be displayed
09:20 < hufg:#liferay> like show a link or something in theme if the user is signed in
09:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> I have several pages that are all public. When the user signs in, those still stay as public (web/guest) ... but a few of them become "unlocked" like the My Profile page.
09:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> so right now I have an #if - #else - #end where I use the "is signed in" to check whether or not to show "sign in" or "my profile"
09:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> sign in link is easy :)
09:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> profile link not so easy.
09:21 < hufg:#liferay> mm
09:23 < hufg:#liferay> how come?
09:24 < jardineworks:#liferay> I can't figure out how to get it :)
09:24 < hufg:#liferay> you need to hard code at least some of it like the friendly url of the page
09:24 < jardineworks:#liferay> I tried to used $portalUtil.getLayoutFriendlyURL($layout, $themeDisplay)
09:24 < jardineworks:#liferay> right ... I am doing
09:24 < jardineworks:#liferay> $portalUtil.getLayoutFriendlyURL($layout, $themeDisplay)/my-site
09:25 < hufg:#liferay> mm
09:26 < hufg:#liferay> there is probably an api call somewhere to get this done somewhat neatly
09:27 < hufg:#liferay> or you can build the url, for example if you can use a context link '/' get portal getPathFriendlyURLPublic(), then get the correct group and get group friendly url
09:27 < jardineworks:#liferay> I think the challenge for me is that the users current context might not be what I need. The above returns the CURRENT context... /web/guest for example, but I need the private context.
09:28 < hufg:#liferay> i think it gets the friendly url to this group
09:28 < jardineworks:#liferay> getLayoutTarget(Layout) ? but... then I have to write code to figure out which Layout in the list is the one I have to pass to it
09:28 < jardineworks:#liferay> I suppose. But I was hoping that there was some magical API call I could make lol
09:29 < hufg:#liferay> there probably is :D
09:29 < jardineworks:#liferay> a page name is unique when scoped with a group no?
09:29 < hufg:#liferay> yes
09:29 < hufg:#liferay> everything is a group
09:29 < hufg:#liferay> almost hehe
09:29 < hufg:#liferay> at least everything has a group
09:30 < jardineworks:#liferay> so I would expect a getLayout( group, string )...
09:30 < hufg:#liferay> getLayoutActualURL(long, boolean, String, String)
09:30 < hufg:#liferay> in portal
09:30 < hufg:#liferay> you should see PortalUtil, Portal
09:31 < hufg:#liferay> there are maaany api calls
09:32 < hufg:#liferay> the themedisplay is set in MainServlet or ServicePreAction
09:32 < hufg:#liferay> and imo it always just contains the "current" context so you can't use api calls using it
09:34 < hufg:#liferay> what you want is to build the path by "manually" or a magic api call where you can define the correct groupId
09:34 < hufg:#liferay> -by
09:35 < hufg:#liferay> for example Portal.getPathFriendlyURLPublic(), retrieve correct group, Group.getFriendlyUrl()
09:36 < jardineworks:#liferay> hmmm
09:37 < jardineworks:#liferay> what about portalUtil.getPathFriendlyURLPrivateGroup() :)
09:39 < hufg:#liferay> hehe
09:39 < hufg:#liferay> yeah
09:41 < hufg:#liferay> there many ways to get the url 8)
09:43 < jardineworks:#liferay> so tempted to hardcode right now.
09:43 < jardineworks:#liferay> wait, if I somehow defined a friendly URL for /my-profile ... wouldn't that mean that I dont need to do this magic?
09:47 < hufg:#liferay> uhuh yeah probably if nothing is expected to change
09:48 < hufg:#liferay> setting/unsetting a virtualhost will implode a hardcoded url, so will changing the group friendlyurl
09:50 < jardineworks:#liferay> ok... so the path to the page is supposedly ... /group/guest/my-profile.
09:50 < jardineworks:#liferay> the getPathFriendlyURLPrivateGroup gives me the group portion... what is the guest portion?
09:52 < hufg:#liferay> group friendlyurl imo
09:52 < hufg:#liferay> check it from ui
09:54 < hufg:#liferay> for example if i make a site (in 6.1) the path is /web/new-site, web is path to public group and 'new-site' is group friendlyurl
09:55 < jardineworks:#liferay> yeah, my site is set to /guest.
09:55 < jardineworks:#liferay> and you can't get rid of it?
09:55 < jardineworks:#liferay> :S
09:55 < hufg:#liferay> hmm?
09:55 < jardineworks:#liferay> ah
09:56 < jardineworks:#liferay> virtual hosts.
09:56 < hufg:#liferay> yes yes
09:56 < hufg:#liferay> or some hilarious load balancing
09:57 < jardineworks:#liferay> so... if I set my link to be $portalUtil.getPathFriendlyURLPrivateGroup()/guest/my-profile that is still bad since you can change the /guest part.
09:57 < jardineworks:#liferay> shit.
09:57 < jardineworks:#liferay> so the guest... is the SITE friendly URL..
09:57 < hufg:#liferay> mm yes or group
09:58 < hufg:#liferay> group is more correct
09:58 < hufg:#liferay> group is a bit of funny name but i guess it suffices
09:59 < hufg:#liferay> it comes from the db tables and is used consistently in the api
09:59 < jardineworks:#liferay> right. But there is not group object in the velocity variables.
10:01 < hufg:#liferay> current group is in themedisplay, the rest can be accessed from grouplocalservice which can be accessed from servicelocator
10:01 < hufg:#liferay> there is actually $page_group
10:02 < jardineworks:#liferay> $page_group in VelocityVariablesImpl?
10:02 < hufg:#liferay> no init.vm
10:02 < jardineworks:#liferay> oh
10:04 < hufg:#liferay> i bet you  can acccess the user private group from somewhere too
10:04 < hufg:#liferay> without specifying groupids
10:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> Group.getPathFriendlyURL(boolean themeDisplay). ... and the boolean is true for private pages :)
10:08 < hufg:#liferay> mm, ok back to work! 8)
10:13 < jardineworks:#liferay> bah... that returns /group as well.
10:29 < hufg:#liferay> man the error page handling is a mess
10:30 < hufg:#liferay> more so with neat virtualhost/no virtualhost combinations
10:42 < jardineworks:#liferay> I haven't gotten there yet.. what is the mess you have found?
10:44 < jardineworks:#liferay> how the hell is there no "getSiteFriendlyURL" in the Portal util?!
10:52 < hufg:#liferay> jardineworks: the page context works differently with virtualhost and no virtualhost
10:52 < hufg:#liferay> this combined with ga2 virtualhost bugs is zz pzz
10:53 < hufg:#liferay> it will throw you into the default group without virtualhost and a configured error page is an external jsp without liferay context
10:53 < hufg:#liferay> so handling 404 and 500 is ehh ehh gr8
10:53 < jardineworks:#liferay> hufg, sure -- but if you can set the "friendly url for both public and private" pages... then you should be able to retreive it as well right? I mean, THAT portion of the friendly URL should be page/context agnostic.
10:54 < hufg:#liferay> i was speaking of the mess 8)
10:54 < jardineworks:#liferay> oh!
10:54 < jardineworks:#liferay> haha
10:54 < jardineworks:#liferay> Iew
10:54 < jardineworks:#liferay> ew
10:54 < jardineworks:#liferay> that doesn't seem very well thought out.
10:55 < hufg:#liferay> no it's very bad
10:55 < hufg:#liferay> the problem is losing "liferay" context without virtualhost
10:58 < hufg:#liferay> liferay has a lot of rough edges but you can almost always muddle through 8)
11:15 < jardineworks:#liferay> I think I have to parse it out of the string man. I don't see any way to get the /xxx site setting
11:16 < jardineworks:#liferay> unless jhf knows some internal secret that he can share with us :)
11:16 <@jhf:#liferay> pooh secrets! I love secrets! reading...
11:16 <@jhf:#liferay> *ooh not pooh
11:17 < jardineworks:#liferay> summary
11:17 < jardineworks:#liferay> I'm trying to build a private url dynamcially in a VM template
11:17 < jardineworks:#liferay> I have the /group portion
11:17 < jardineworks:#liferay> but I need to get the /guest (orwhatever I change it to)
11:19 <@jhf:#liferay> is that in web content vm template or a theme vm template?
11:19 < jardineworks:#liferay> $company.getPortalURL?
11:19 < jardineworks:#liferay> theme
11:20 < hufg:#liferay> just collect all interesting api calls and put them on the page and pick correct one!
11:20 < hufg:#liferay> :d
11:20 <@jhf:#liferay> i am sure there is a way. I am searching (do not know immediately)
11:20 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah
11:31 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah I think you want PortalUtil.getGroupFriendlyURL()
11:31 <@jhf:#liferay> I think that will give you the full URL up to the /guest part
11:31 <@jhf:#liferay> http://docs.liferay.com/portal/6.1/javadocs/com/liferay/portal/util/PortalUtil.html#getGroupFriendlyURL(com.liferay.portal.model.Group, boolean, com.liferay.portal.theme.ThemeDisplay)
11:31 <@jhf:#liferay> dang well that URL got munged
11:31 <@jhf:#liferay> http://goo.gl/eNcQp5
11:32 <@jhf:#liferay> you can get the value of the group argument with something like themeDisplay.getScopeGroup()
11:33 <@jhf:#liferay> set privateLayoutSet to false (or else you'll get "/group/guest" instead of "/web/guest")
11:50 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, VMs silent error stuff is so obnoxious. This fails -- $portalUtil.getGroupFriendlyUrl($themeDisplay.getScopeGroup(), true, $themeDisplay )
11:50 < jardineworks:#liferay> BUT
11:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> if I output the individual pieces, $themeDispla.getScopeGroup() and $themeDisplay... I get the objects
11:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> ...
11:51 <@jhf:#liferay> you sure that the objects are of the right type?
11:52 <@jhf:#liferay> like if you just output $themeDisplay it really is an instance of the theme display class, and not a hash map
11:52 <@jhf:#liferay> (which it is when used in WCM templates)
11:52 < jardineworks:#liferay> I get back -- com.liferay.portal.theme.ThemeDisplay@4a2bc421
11:53 < jardineworks:#liferay> and I passed it in another call and it worked.
11:53 <@jhf:#liferay> also
11:53 < jardineworks:#liferay> maybe my method is fat fingered.
11:53 <@jhf:#liferay> it's getGroupFriendlyURL
11:53 <@jhf:#liferay> not Url
11:53 < jardineworks:#liferay> that was probably it
11:53 <@jhf:#liferay> +1 for freemarker
11:53 <@jhf:#liferay> :)
11:53 < jardineworks:#liferay> lol
11:53 < jardineworks:#liferay> :S
11:53 <@jhf:#liferay> anyone going to San Francisco next week?
11:53 < jardineworks:#liferay> I think my mechanical keyboard actually makes me a WORSE typer
11:54 <@jhf:#liferay> for the LR symposium? or will be in the area?
11:54 <@jhf:#liferay> free tickets
11:55 <@jhf:#liferay> mechanical keyboard? is that some cool steampunk riff on a traditional keyboard? or are you just saying you're better with soft keyboards like on smartphones
12:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, mechanical keyboards are those loud abnoxious ones that click when you type. They're actually much faster to work on and less error prone. Down side is how loud they are, but since I work by myself from home, there is no one to annoy except myself :)
12:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> and I can just turn my music up.
12:05 <@jhf:#liferay> ok.  like those old IBM ones.
12:06 <@jhf:#liferay> I have a modern logitech kbd but it is also clicky.
12:06 < jardineworks:#liferay> ... but what I find is that I just make typos faster than I did with one of those soft touch quiet keyboards lol
12:06 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah..
12:06 < jardineworks:#liferay> I used to use a logitech dinovo... I loved it. But Ubuntu is finicky with bluetooth keyboards... or that one at least and I got sick of having to change the settings all the time.
12:07 < jardineworks:#liferay> so the friendly url is gold. That works... thanks for that. But how come it doesn't apply my theme? :(
12:08 < jardineworks:#liferay> I created a private page and in the header I have <a href="$portalUtil.getGroupFriendlyURL($themeDisplay.getScopeGroup(), true, $themeDisplay )/my-profile">
12:08 < jardineworks:#liferay> its takes me there. .But she is UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUGLY.
12:08 <@jhf:#liferay> hmmm
12:08 <@jhf:#liferay> that should not be, assuming the theme is properly applied to the private pages of that site
12:08 <@jhf:#liferay> (or that specific page /my-profile)
12:08 <@jhf:#liferay> if you hit reload, does it work? :)
12:09 <@jhf:#liferay> I mean, what if you just type in the same URL that that getGroupFrieldlyURL call generates
12:09 <@jhf:#liferay> do you get the theme properly applied?
12:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> hmm.. reload. negative. If I go back to my home page and then key it in.. nadda
12:13 < jardineworks:#liferay> well, not nadda... just uggo
12:14 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, Ah, I think it was because I was playing with the virtual domain stuff
12:14 < jardineworks:#liferay> I took that stuff out and she is find.
12:39 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, how was the dev con?
12:40 <@jhf:#liferay> jardineworks: it was really cool having so many LR devs in the same place :)
12:40 <@jhf:#liferay> pics: http://www.flickr.com/photos/liferay/sets/72157634432018206/
12:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> hah -- awesome. When is the next one?
12:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> :)
13:10 <@jhf:#liferay> next one? I am hoping sometime early next year
13:10 <@jhf:#liferay> (in the US) but who knows.
13:13 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Hi guys. It was my first conference and I was a little bit overwhelmed, to be honest. I still haven't managed to go through all my notes.
13:13 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Looks like I was carrying around a cold waiting to explode on me...which it finally did on Friday. -.-
13:15 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Anyway...I don't really have a comparison, but to me it all seemes perfectly organized and filled with great and very informative talks.
13:16 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> The networking part, sadly, appears to not be my thing at all. I guess I'm a prime member of Olaf's club.
13:16 <@jhf:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur: !  did we meet at nascon ?
13:16 <@jhf:#liferay> err.. devcon :)
13:16 <@jhf:#liferay> (sorry have NAS (north america symposium) on my brain)
13:16 <@jhf:#liferay> I got to meet scribe
13:16 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> No we didn't.
13:16 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> You were always surrounded by too many people.
13:16 <@jhf:#liferay> awwww!!
13:17 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> And I'm not the right type to just push through without anything to say but "hi". ;)
13:17 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> My colleague also kept me busy most of the breaks...discussing stuff and munching new information he picked up.
13:17 <@jhf:#liferay> well I'm glad you attended anyway - it was our first one and I thought it went well and the sessions were good.
13:18 <@jhf:#liferay> I was quite tired after all was said and done. and then we ended up out past 3am drinking beers
13:18 <@jhf:#liferay> and I had a 7am flight
13:18 <@jhf:#liferay> not the best idea.
13:18 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Sounds like most of the other stories I know from conferences. ;)
13:18 <@jhf:#liferay> also there was a 1.5 hr delay in berlin. causing me to have to RUN to my connecting flight in copenhagen
13:18 <@jhf:#liferay> I barely made it.. my luggage did not.
13:19 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Oh joy. I hate having to run to catch a flight.
13:19 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Usually flying is such a relaxed way of traveling.
13:19 <@jhf:#liferay> also, there was this super-angry guy in toronto US customs pre-clearance area, got pissed that the scanner wouldn't read his boarding pass, and started punching the kiosk
13:19 <@jhf:#liferay> he was taken away somewhere, most likely never to be seen again
13:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> haha
13:20 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Oh and I have to agree...I enjoyed almost all of the sessions I attended. The only thing I would criticise: Sometimes the really interesting sessions were cut a little too short.
13:20 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I think at least 4 or 5 speakers were *very* surprised when they were shown the 10 minutes left card. ;)
13:22 <@jhf:#liferay> yup.. it's always tough when planning events, how long each session should be. the theory was that for technical topics without practical/hands-on/demo stuff, 20 mins is enough to spur thought and then you can meet later.
13:22 <@jhf:#liferay> those with practical / hands-on stuff, 40 mins.
13:22 <@jhf:#liferay> anything longer and you run the risk of boredom. but yeah. some topics could go an hour or more.
13:23 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Yeah. Somehow that was a little tough for me. I found it way easier to speak to the guys directly after the session. But there usually was only like 5 minutes time.
13:23 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> But that's most likely a rather unique problem of mine. ;)
13:24 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> My only problem now is: I know now what to expect with 6.2 and at work I have to go back to 6.1.0. ;)
13:28 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> The fact that I could pretty much walk to the hotel changed my perspective obviously. For all those people traveling from all over Europe, it's a much bigger event than for me, who can just walk home in the evening. ;) It still was a great experience and I'm happy I got to attend.
15:26 < jardineworks:#liferay> does anyone in here use eclipse?
15:30 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I do.
15:32 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> But as usual...I'm home and don't have it in front of me right now. ;)
16:07 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, have you ever seen an error, during debugging, where the line number and local variable is "not available"?
16:08 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Mhm.  I vaguely remember a situation where the debugger semmed to always show the wrong sourcecode.
16:09 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> But that was due to some weird issue with the source code attachment to a library.
16:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, might be the same issue
16:13 < jardineworks:#liferay> I have 3 projects that are compiled to jars ... they're my framework for integration basically. I push these with the plugins.
16:14 < jardineworks:#liferay> For some reason though, I can't step into them during debug. Well, I seemingly can, but I can never get the actual lines and variables.
16:14 < jardineworks:#liferay> it's really starting to piss me off.
16:14 < jardineworks:#liferay> I had this problem once a month ago and it was something ridiculous to fix it. Like close this window and re open it type non seense.
16:14 < jardineworks:#liferay> but I can find the post where I found the solution
16:16 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Mhm. Do you deploy everything from Eclipse or did you include the jar Files in the project you're trying to debug?
16:17 < jardineworks:#liferay> I have a separate ant script that generates the jars and dumps them into the sdk/lin folder. I have a modified version of the LR ant files that includes them with the plygins.
16:18 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Mhm. Anyway...should be the same files.
16:19 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I'm not sure about the details of Eclipse's debugger.
16:21 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> In my experience Eclipse is great if everything works...but as soon as that's not the case anymore, you're royally screwed. ;)
16:29 < jardineworks:#liferay> GOT IT!
16:29 < jardineworks:#liferay> fuck I hate eclipse sometimes.
16:29 < jardineworks:#liferay> but this time I suppose it was not its fault.
16:29 < jardineworks:#liferay> debug="true" on the ant javac target.
16:35 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Eew.
16:35 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Always this tiny things.
16:35 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> *these
18:20 < Naenyn:#liferay> Do any of you have any experience with analytics w/ liferay?
