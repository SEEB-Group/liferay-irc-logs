02:24 < twen> hello
05:00 < Alex_> hi guys. I am very new to Liferay and am still trying to figure things out. My log shows an error that JIRA has it as Closed and Fixed. ...and this is where I get lost! What do I do to get this fix?
05:09 < twen> Can I move a public page to a the private area of a site ? I see I can only copy applications fron pulbic to pubilc or private to prive, but not pulbic to private
05:10 < twen> Alex_ If you don't tell what error you have... nobody will know and answer ) (I'm beginniner in Liferay too by the way. Be patient also here)
05:11 < Alex_> twen The error is this: https://issues.liferay.com/browse/LPS-35078 But I want to learn how this process works for other errors too
05:24 < circ-user-yyBn6> hi !
05:28 < circ-user-yyBn6> i have a question about friendly url:
05:28 < circ-user-yyBn6> if using a <pattern>/{id}</pattern>
05:29 < circ-user-yyBn6> should I have this id value available in view.jsp
05:29 < circ-user-yyBn6> as String c = (String)request.getAttribute("id");
05:31 < circ-user-yyBn6> I also used the followings in friendly-url-route:
05:31 < circ-user-yyBn6> <implicit-parameter name="p_p_lifecycle">0</implicit-parameter>   <implicit-parameter name="p_p_state">normal</implicit-parameter>   <implicit-parameter name="p_p_mode">view</implicit-parameter>
07:25 < twen> tell me if I'm wrong. Downloaded and install Lifery CE 6.2 GA2, which point to http://sourceforge.net/projects/lportal/files/Liferay%20Portal/6.2.1%20GA2/ <-- version 6.2.1
07:25 < twen> BUt, the build number of this version is 6201 !
07:26 < twen> shouldn't it be build number 6210 ?
07:27 < twen> I noticed this when trying to download HR portal portlet (http://wiki.rivetlogic.com/display/LRA/HR+Portal)... none of the version 6.2.0 and 6.2.1 are allowed, because build number don't match (6200 and 6210 don't match liferay's 6201 )
07:30 < twen> or there is some numbering I miss ;)
07:38 < circ-user-yyBn6> i have a question about friendly url:
07:38 < circ-user-yyBn6> if using a <pattern>/{id}</pattern>
07:38 < circ-user-yyBn6> should I have this id value available in view.jsp
07:38 < circ-user-yyBn6> ?
07:38 < circ-user-yyBn6> if yes, how to retrieve it ?
07:42 < twen> OH, ok.. I found.. my mistake.... build number 6200, 6201 and 6210 exist ! 6200 I guess is version 6.2.0 GA1, 6201 is version 6.2.1 GA2, I'm wondeing whet version is 6210... version 6.2.10 GA10?

10:08 < bijoo_> Alex_: you have to look at fix version for that.
10:08 < bijoo_> Alex_: what version of Liferay are you using?
10:09 < bijoo_> Alex_: Liferay includes fixes later versions.
10:12 < bijoo_> twen: no that's not OOB feature here; you could export/import the site there though.
10:12 < twen> OOb ?
10:12 < bijoo_> twen: Out-of-the-box
10:13 < bijoo_> so by default feature
10:13 < twen> it's the HR portal I try to import... it's said 6.2 GA1+ compatible, but build don't work.
10:13 < twen> that's fine I'm installing 6.2 GA1 instead... I guess not a lot of plugins have migrated yet to GA2
10:14 < twen> :)
10:14 < twen> thanks bijoo_
10:17 < Alex_> bijoo_ But I have 6.2 GA2 _which I think is the latest. If this has been already resolved why do I still get it ?
10:22 < bijoo_> Alex_: checking, it should be fixed in that version.
10:23 < Alex_> bijoo_: I still get it :(
10:25 < bijoo_> Alex_: did you try the solution on this thread? https://www.liferay.com/community/forums/-/message_boards/message/31010623
10:25 < bijoo_> Alex_: there was no code commit with for that issue; it might be another type of problem.
