02:24 < twen> hello
05:00 < Alex_> hi guys. I am very new to Liferay and am still trying to figure things out. My log shows an error that JIRA has it as Closed and Fixed. ...and this is where I get lost! What do I do to get this fix?
05:09 < twen> Can I move a public page to a the private area of a site ? I see I can only copy applications fron pulbic to pubilc or private to prive, but not pulbic to private
05:10 < twen> Alex_ If you don't tell what error you have... nobody will know and answer ) (I'm beginniner in Liferay too by the way. Be patient also here)
05:11 < Alex_> twen The error is this: https://issues.liferay.com/browse/LPS-35078 But I want to learn how this process works for other errors too
05:24 < circ-user-yyBn6> hi !
05:28 < circ-user-yyBn6> i have a question about friendly url:
05:28 < circ-user-yyBn6> if using a <pattern>/{id}</pattern>
05:29 < circ-user-yyBn6> should I have this id value available in view.jsp
05:29 < circ-user-yyBn6> as String c = (String)request.getAttribute("id");
05:31 < circ-user-yyBn6> I also used the followings in friendly-url-route:
05:31 < circ-user-yyBn6> <implicit-parameter name="p_p_lifecycle">0</implicit-parameter>   <implicit-parameter name="p_p_state">normal</implicit-parameter>   <implicit-parameter name="p_p_mode">view</implicit-parameter>
