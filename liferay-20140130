01:47 < Axxell:#liferay> Hey guys, do any of you have an example how to make an asset publisher fremarker ftl that would only display images? Cant seem to find how to get the type of an assetentry when making an application display templates?
01:49 < Axxell:#liferay> what i would like to do, is loop through all content that is about to be shown, and only if an asset is an image, display that image
01:49 < Axxell:#liferay> topolik
01:49 < Axxell:#liferay> topolik: maybe you have something, you allways do :)
01:50 < Axxell:#liferay> @jhf: or maybe you have some good examples how that would be done
02:31 < Axxell:#liferay> im a little new to freemarker too, when trying to do this:  <#assign assetPublisherUtil = utilLocator.findUtil("com.liferay.portlet.assetpublisher.util.AssetPublisherUtil")>          <#assign entryClasses = assetPublisherUtil.getClassName(entry.getAssetRendererFactory())> , I get the error: Expression assetPublisherUtil.getClassName is undefined
02:39 < topolik:#liferay> Axxell: to be honest I haven't worked with ADT yet, but I try to look at it ;)
02:43 < Axxell:#liferay> topolik: I added the following to portal-ext.properties: velocity.engine.restricted.classes= velocity.engine.restricted.variables= freemarker.engine.restricted.classes= freemarker.engine.restricted.variables=
02:43 < Axxell:#liferay> toplik: allthough that didnt help..
02:45 < Axxell:#liferay> topolik: dont know why i cant use those classes
03:15 < topolik:#liferay> Axxell: https://gist.github.com/topolik/8704454
03:16 < Axxell:#liferay> topolik: what about using some liferay classes?
03:17 < topolik:#liferay> oh, I try
03:18 < Axxell:#liferay> topolik: thanks, whatever i do it allways says that expression is undefined
03:26 < Axxell:#liferay> ok, topolik, i got it to work with the following: http://pastebin.com/M1EfXkbf
03:27 < Axxell:#liferay> topolik: allthough i would have liked to be able to have some sort of thumb of previewpic instead of the full version of the pics
03:28 < topolik:#liferay> try to append &imageThumbnail=1 or &imagePreview=1 to the image URL
03:45 < Axxell:#liferay> topolik: the imageThumbnail=1 one worked, but was a little low res so i put: dl.file.entry.thumbnail.max.width in portal-ext.properties
03:48 < Axxell:#liferay> topolik: did also custom thumbnails so my thumbnail=2 was of suitable size
03:53 < Axxell:#liferay> topolik: now im gonna do a modalpic thing for that image
04:17 < Axxell:#liferay> Intresting enough bootstrap modals dont seem to work in liferay
04:31 < charith:#liferay> hello
04:31 < charith:#liferay> is there a way to disable "source" button in edit web content ?
04:37 < modd_:#liferay> charith: you can drop it from the view
04:38 < charith:#liferay> modd_: i want to disable it for some users, what you mean by view?
04:53 < charith:#liferay> modd_: you there?

09:01 < ferrema:#liferay> hi there
09:02 < ferrema:#liferay> i was wondering if there is someone that can enlight me
09:02 < ferrema:#liferay> i am trying to migrate an image gallery in LF 6.0.6 in order to have as little issues as possible during the migration to LF6.1x and 6.2
09:03 < ferrema:#liferay> i am recieving an SQL error that looks like this
09:03 < ferrema:#liferay> com.liferay.portal.convert.ConvertException: org.postgresql.util.PSQLException: ERROR: zero-length delimited identifier at or near """"
09:03 < ferrema:#liferay> checked the sources
09:03 < ferrema:#liferay> and in doConvert() in ConvertImageGallery.java i see the following :
09:03 < ferrema:#liferay> 				db.runSQL("update Image set text_ = \"\"");
09:04 < ferrema:#liferay> which is not going to work in something that is not MYSQL (Postgres in my case)
09:04 < ferrema:#liferay> am I missing something here ?
09:05 < ferrema:#liferay> or is it just a test that was not considered (aka a bug) and I can safely hard code '' instead of  \"\" ?
09:43 < ferrema:#liferay> fyi : i changed the call and the library was migrated in a couple of seconds
11:29 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik, do you know if there is a way to catch "porltlet unavailable" errors?
11:34 < modd:#liferay> while rendering the page...
11:34 < modd:#liferay> it will check all portlets and demand their render-output to create the html for the user
11:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> modd, right now I am looking at the render_portlet.jsp since that looks like a point in the stacktrace that you are talking about
11:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> I basically want to trap the exception though and redirect the user to a general error page.
11:52 < jardineworks:#liferay> modd, the lowest (liferay) point in the stack trace appears to be com.liferay.portal.kernel.servlet.filters.invoker.InvokerFilter.doFilter(InvokerFilter.java:79)
12:21 < modd:#liferay> well, the lowest is not the best...I can't remember when it was the best..ever^^
12:23 < jardineworks:#liferay> modd, lol -- fair point.
12:24 < jardineworks:#liferay> modd, I actually have a jsp override for portlet_error.jsp ... I am hoping to be able to rediect there.
12:33 < jardineworks:#liferay> or -- just change the jsp duh.
12:33 < jardineworks:#liferay> is it friday yet?
