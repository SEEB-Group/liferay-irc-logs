03:42 < guli:#liferay> topolik : are you here?
04:06 < topolik:#liferay> hi guli, good, thanks you?
04:08 < guli:#liferay> topolik: good thanks :)
04:08 < guli:#liferay> i progress on my issue
04:09 < guli:#liferay> topolik: i've found that the local cache was a first issue :) disabling the local cache works in the common case.
04:10 < guli:#liferay> topolik: have you any idea of the effect of disabling local cache?
04:12 < topolik:#liferay> things will go slower for the entity you disabled
04:14 < guli:#liferay> i disabled all local cache
04:14 < guli:#liferay> but the portal cache is still active
04:14 < guli:#liferay> topolik: i will make test in the future on this point.
04:14 < guli:#liferay> topolik: but the issue is not fully fixed ....
04:15 < guli:#liferay> topolik: the original use case was when an user accept a socialrequest using the requests portlet.
04:15 < guli:#liferay> and in this case the transaction is not used.... my service fail after doing some change and the changes are saved to DB
04:26 < guli:#liferay> if think that it's caused by the fact that in socialrequestinterpreter you need to use *ServiceUtil and that the processConfirmation() method of the interpreter is called into a service
04:27 < guli:#liferay> but i don't know how to do this in an other way....
04:36 < topolik:#liferay> guli?
04:45 < guli:#liferay> topolik: so i discover that socialrequestinterpreter seems to have been removed from Liferay...
04:46 < topolik:#liferay> guli: I'm sorry I don't know this part of Liferay
04:47 < guli:#liferay> topolik: do you who i can contact?
04:48 < topolik:#liferay> hmm, I can see socialrequestinterpreter in the latest master
04:48 < guli:#liferay> yes i just see too
04:48 < guli:#liferay> i tell that because in 6.1 in contacts-portlet (liferay-plugin) request are handled using socialrequestinterpreter
04:49 < topolik:#liferay> and the transaction - you save your entitity together with portal entity in one transaction?
04:49 < guli:#liferay> and now in master it use BaseUserNotificationHandler that create accept and ignore portlet URL to the portlet
04:50 < guli:#liferay> topolik: yes it works, i build a little project that calls my service from a controller and it works as expected.
04:50 < topolik:#liferay> uhm, interesting
04:50 < topolik:#liferay> I know it didn't work in 6.0
04:51 < topolik:#liferay> because both transactions were separate, because hibernate sessions were separate
04:52 < topolik:#liferay> some of our architect in previous job tried that and he succeed using some artificial transaction in spring which held both transactions
04:52 < topolik:#liferay> but this may be already fixed
04:53 < guli:#liferay> it works good in 6.1
04:53 < topolik:#liferay> only the cache
04:54 < guli:#liferay> yep it works good except for the local cache that is not transactional
04:54 < guli:#liferay> the portal cache is transactional
05:03 < guli:#liferay> topolik: i see that a notification-portlet has been creted in liferay-plugin...
05:11 < lapache_:#liferay> Hello, is there an automatic way for upgrade liferay/tomcat bundle ?
