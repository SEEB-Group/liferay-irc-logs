03:42 < guli:#liferay> topolik : are you here?
04:06 < topolik:#liferay> hi guli, good, thanks you?
04:08 < guli:#liferay> topolik: good thanks :)
04:08 < guli:#liferay> i progress on my issue
04:09 < guli:#liferay> topolik: i've found that the local cache was a first issue :) disabling the local cache works in the common case.
04:10 < guli:#liferay> topolik: have you any idea of the effect of disabling local cache?
04:12 < topolik:#liferay> things will go slower for the entity you disabled
04:14 < guli:#liferay> i disabled all local cache
04:14 < guli:#liferay> but the portal cache is still active
04:14 < guli:#liferay> topolik: i will make test in the future on this point.
04:14 < guli:#liferay> topolik: but the issue is not fully fixed ....
04:15 < guli:#liferay> topolik: the original use case was when an user accept a socialrequest using the requests portlet.
04:15 < guli:#liferay> and in this case the transaction is not used.... my service fail after doing some change and the changes are saved to DB
04:26 < guli:#liferay> if think that it's caused by the fact that in socialrequestinterpreter you need to use *ServiceUtil and that the processConfirmation() method of the interpreter is called into a service
04:27 < guli:#liferay> but i don't know how to do this in an other way....
04:36 < topolik:#liferay> guli?
04:45 < guli:#liferay> topolik: so i discover that socialrequestinterpreter seems to have been removed from Liferay...
04:46 < topolik:#liferay> guli: I'm sorry I don't know this part of Liferay
04:47 < guli:#liferay> topolik: do you who i can contact?
04:48 < topolik:#liferay> hmm, I can see socialrequestinterpreter in the latest master
04:48 < guli:#liferay> yes i just see too
04:48 < guli:#liferay> i tell that because in 6.1 in contacts-portlet (liferay-plugin) request are handled using socialrequestinterpreter
04:49 < topolik:#liferay> and the transaction - you save your entitity together with portal entity in one transaction?
04:49 < guli:#liferay> and now in master it use BaseUserNotificationHandler that create accept and ignore portlet URL to the portlet
04:50 < guli:#liferay> topolik: yes it works, i build a little project that calls my service from a controller and it works as expected.
04:50 < topolik:#liferay> uhm, interesting
04:50 < topolik:#liferay> I know it didn't work in 6.0
04:51 < topolik:#liferay> because both transactions were separate, because hibernate sessions were separate
04:52 < topolik:#liferay> some of our architect in previous job tried that and he succeed using some artificial transaction in spring which held both transactions
04:52 < topolik:#liferay> but this may be already fixed
04:53 < guli:#liferay> it works good in 6.1
04:53 < topolik:#liferay> only the cache
04:54 < guli:#liferay> yep it works good except for the local cache that is not transactional
04:54 < guli:#liferay> the portal cache is transactional
05:03 < guli:#liferay> topolik: i see that a notification-portlet has been creted in liferay-plugin...
05:11 < lapache_:#liferay> Hello, is there an automatic way for upgrade liferay/tomcat bundle ?
05:13 < topolik:#liferay> https://www.liferay.com/documentation/liferay-portal/6.1/user-guide/-/ai/upgrading-lifer-5 or https://www.liferay.com/documentation/liferay-portal/6.2/user-guide/-/ai/upgrading-liferay-liferay-portal-6-2-user-guide-18-en
05:46 < Axxell:#liferay> hey guys
05:47 < Axxell:#liferay> I was under the impression that liferay 6.2 used bootstrap 3, now that ive looked at makin themes with it, it seems to be bootstrap 2.32
05:48 < Axxell:#liferay> are there any plans that you know of, to change that? The changes of the names of the css classes are probably break the thing if i try to use my bootstrap 3 mockup modell?
08:53 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Liferay is driving me insane...
08:54 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, that means you are using it properly :)
08:54 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Ok. Imagine this: On our old Liferay 6.1.0 we had several page, which loaded content via AJAX from /c/journal/view_article_content?cmd=preview... Now we migrated to 6.1.2 and all of a sudden these articles don't work anymore.
08:55 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I tracked it down to the fact that apparently "cmd=preview" is not supported in 6.1.2.
08:56 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I considered rewriting the URLs to cmd=view, because then it works. BUT it turns out that they used the preview link, because they didn't find a way to publish the articles that are loaded via AJAX.
08:56 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> So when I rewrite the URLs now, the articles show outdated content.
08:57 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> The question now is: Can I find a different approach to load staged web content articles via a specific URL or is there some way to publish a bunch of articles that are not used on any page?
08:57 < jardineworks:#liferay> you mean the preview shows outdated content?
08:57 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> No. The cmd=view shows outdated content, because the articles have been changed, but not published.
08:57 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, you could write your own hook maybe?
08:58 < jardineworks:#liferay> put the preview back in?
08:58 < jardineworks:#liferay> (with your own hook)
08:58 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Yes...maybe.
08:58 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Not a big fan of that, however.
08:58 < jardineworks:#liferay> how come?
08:58 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Seems like the wrong approach to me.
08:58 < jardineworks:#liferay> struts hooks are easy peasy to do in 6.1 -- they no longer require EXT plugins
08:59 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Would it work if I published a page that contains an asset publisher, which shows all of these articles?
08:59 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Because apparently you can't publish content articles independently, right?
09:00 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Or maybe I should just put all of the articles on separate pages and publish the parent page with "include descendant pages". This way they would be found by the search as well.
09:02 < jardineworks:#liferay> I'm not sure to be honest -- I have limited asset publisher experience at the moment. The last one you said though with the descendent pages sounds promising
09:07 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> The problem is that they threw compatibility with Non-JS browsers out the window at some point.
09:08 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> So there is no non-ajax version of the different pages.
09:08 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> In theory there would have to be hard copies of all the different pages than can be created by loading the content dynamically.
09:09 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> But there isn't. Which also leads to the fact that the dynamically loaded content can't be found in the search...so fixing this and thereby also fixing the searching issue sounds like a good idea somehow.
09:33 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Mmmmhm.
09:34 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> General question: When I build a Blog with Liferay, I have a page with an asset publisher to show the most recent entries.
09:34 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> How would I publish the articles for the blog?
09:35 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> All articles would be created on staging...how would I push them to live? The option to publish articles seems to be missing. Oo
09:43 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> (I'm thinking about building some way to publish the lazy loaded articles instead of recreating this preview link stuff.)
11:11 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Mhm. I guess it's Friday, eh?
11:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> \o/
11:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> :)
11:22 < jardineworks:#liferay> but I have toi work this weekend :(
11:48 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I think I found a solution for my problem.
11:49 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I will create a page and put all the different articles on there, which are loaded via AJAX.
11:49 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> This page can be published to ensure the correct versions of the articles are live and available for the JS.
11:50 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> And I create a rewrite rule, which will guide people that stumble upon this page (e.g. via the search) are redirected to the original page.
11:50 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> -are redirected
11:50 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> (It's getting late...my brain is getting all fuzzy.)
11:55 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> jhf: Are you around? Maybe you can help me out with this stuff? I assume the Liferay page uses web content articles for blogging? Are you using staging there?
11:56 <@jhf:#liferay> no, we use the standard 'blogs' portlet on liferay.com
11:56 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Mhm. :-(
11:57 <@jhf:#liferay> we use the staging feature of liferay for some of the sites, but not all of them (and not for the liferay.com 'site' on .. liferay.com)
11:57 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Quick summary: How do you publish web content articles from staging to live, if they are not used on any page?
11:59 <@jhf:#liferay> I assumed staging would 'publish' all articles, whether or not they are configured to be displayed via a web content display portlet or asset publisher.
11:59 <@jhf:#liferay> is that not true?
12:07 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I actually have no clue how to publish an article.
12:07 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> So far I only published pages containing articles.
12:07 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> And there the article is always published as well.
12:08 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, do you know if I can automatically set the UPDATE permissions on an Expando (User) value?
12:08 < jardineworks:#liferay> I create it dynamically as a systemconfig hook... so it GETS there... but I need to set the permissions as well.
12:08 < jardineworks:#liferay> right now I have to do it by hand which is crapass
12:09 <@jhf:#liferay> jardineworks: you should be able to set the permissions on it at creation time via some API. how are you creating it?
12:10 <@jhf:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur: if Web Content Articles are set to be staged (configurable via Site Settings -> Staging), then when you publish the site to live, the articles should go along with it, even if they aren't part of a portlet.
12:13 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Mhm. All articles?
12:14 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> When I check "Web Content" in the publishing dialog for a page all articles are published to live?
12:15 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, I have a application start up hook that I run to check configurations and stuff and use it to report missing/bad configs.
12:16 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, http://pastebin.com/YPELrpiB
12:16 < jardineworks:#liferay> I was originally doing it for just one field... but I need to do it for several.
12:16 < jardineworks:#liferay> so maybe I remove the if?
12:17 <@jhf:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur: no, you first need to create/publish the article, then publish the site to live.. only when you publish the site do the articles actually appear in the 'live' scope.
12:20 <@jhf:#liferay> jardineworks: if that works for that one field, then yeah you can just do it for all by removing the if
12:20 <@jhf:#liferay> I'm looking at how LR does it in control panel.. I swore there was an easier way.
12:23 < jardineworks:#liferay> doesn't seem to work
12:24 < jardineworks:#liferay> I just remembered that it wasn't setting it for guest.
12:25 < jardineworks:#liferay> maybe it should be addResourcePermission?
12:32 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, which file are you looking at for the control poanel?
12:32 <@jhf:#liferay> well control panel (when used to add/edit "custom fields") ends up in https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/blob/master/portal-impl/src/com/liferay/portlet/expando/action/EditExpandoAction.java
12:33 <@jhf:#liferay> there is an 'addExpando' method which ends up creating the column, through the "Expando Bridge" classes
12:35 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, but are the columns that are created treated as "resources"?
12:35 < jardineworks:#liferay> when you add it, the Owner gets the permission by default...
12:35 < jardineworks:#liferay> whereever that happens, I need to repeat it for my other role.s
12:35 <@jhf:#liferay> jardineworks: how about https://www.liferay.com/community/wiki/-/wiki/Main/Adding+an+custom+attribute+to+a+Community
12:35 <@jhf:#liferay> it uses addResourcePermission
12:36 <@jhf:#liferay> see the 'Setting Permissions for Community Members' bit
12:38 < jardineworks:#liferay> oooouu... that looks promising. Lemme try it.
12:40 < jardineworks:#liferay> can't seem to resovle ExpandoBridgeImpl
12:41 < jardineworks:#liferay> .. maybe I don't need it actually
12:45 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf :(
12:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> I'm not getting errors either... so what exactly am I settign lol
12:48 < jardineworks:#liferay> hmm
12:48 < jardineworks:#liferay> {resourceId=0, codeId=0, primKey=190017}
12:49 < jardineworks:#liferay> that doesn't look promisig
12:49 < jardineworks:#liferay> promising*
12:59 < jardineworks:#liferay> fail
13:00 < jardineworks:#liferay> resourceId =  0.... is that like a default for "this didn't work" or "recourse does not exist"??
13:01 <@jhf:#liferay> (on con call for another 15 mins)
13:17 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Uhm.
13:17 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Anyone ever tried to use Memcache with Liferay?
13:18 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I'm a little confused about the fact that the PortalCache interface defines a method registerCacheListener and the MemcachePortalCache throws an UnsupportedOperationException when this is called. Oo
13:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> ummm 6.1.2 GA3 ... why are there buttons in the control panel that simply don't work?
13:51 <@jhf:#liferay> jardineworks: which buttons
13:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, well, the Add button for example
13:52 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, I am tryign to let my user set a password during account creation but I am getting a PACL (guess it is because they are not technically a logged in user yet?)
13:52 < jardineworks:#liferay> I went in to see if I could resolve with permissios
13:52 <@jhf:#liferay> hmmmmm
13:52 < jardineworks:#liferay> there are not on the User
13:52 < jardineworks:#liferay> I am tryign to add
13:53 < jardineworks:#liferay> but javascript shows ;;
13:53 < modd:#liferay> hey jhf, any information why a non-admin user on lr 6.2 will get a permission denied message after login but with another F5 it works fine?
13:54 <@jhf:#liferay> modd: i've seen that in 6.1 because the welcome page hadn't finished loading/being resource-imports
13:54 <@jhf:#liferay> but not in 6.2
13:54 < modd:#liferay> hmm
13:54 < modd:#liferay> weird
13:54 <@jhf:#liferay> jardineworks: works for me.. which browser are you using?
13:55 <@jhf:#liferay> an specifically which button?
13:55 <@jhf:#liferay> like, what did you click on control panel
13:55 <@jhf:#liferay> modd: what is the page you see after the F5? the default 6.2 welcome page?
13:55 < modd:#liferay> yep
13:56 < modd:#liferay> web/guest/
13:56 <@jhf:#liferay> and does it happen even after a while, like after everything is loaded and quiescent
13:57 < modd:#liferay> yes
13:57 < modd:#liferay> every time I'm logging in with a non-admin user
13:59 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, Control Panel > Portal > Roles > Guest (Actions button is dead). Click on Guest, click Define Permissions... and then click the Add v  .. dead (for me)
14:00 <@jhf:#liferay> hmm those all work for me using chrome. do you get any js errors in the developer console of your browser?
14:00 <@jhf:#liferay> it sounds browser-related
14:00 < jardineworks:#liferay> chrome
14:00 < jardineworks:#liferay> is what I am using
14:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> are you on the same version as me jhf?
14:01 <@jhf:#liferay> I am using 31.0.1650.57
14:01 <@jhf:#liferay> on mac os 10.9
14:02 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, sorry.. I meant LR version
14:02 <@jhf:#liferay> 6.1 CE GA3
14:02 < jardineworks:#liferay> I thought I saw a major bug in jira at one point for this
14:02 <@jhf:#liferay> (out of the box with no customization)
