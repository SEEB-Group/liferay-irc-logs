05:08 < bentech4you:#liferay> how can i integrate liferay with active directory
05:19 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Hey guys.
05:20 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Do you know where Liferay stores images that have been uploaded via a "Image Upload" field in a web content structure?
05:21 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I'm asking, because the URL is different from images uploaded to the documents & media library. It uses /image/ rather than /documents/ and I wonder if the image uploader uses the DL nonetheless.
05:21 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I assume it does, but I would prefer knowing.
05:31 < bentech4you:#liferay> anyone please help me to integrate my liferay with active directory

06:14 < hufg:#liferay> maybe that helkp
06:14 < hufg:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur: no idea, tell me if you know 8)
06:15 < hufg:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur: get the struts path to retrieve images, see struts-config.xml, check implementation of configured class
06:16 < hufg:#liferay> what is the struts path?
06:17 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I vaguely remember that I already tried looking it up.
06:17 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I'll grab a full path. One sec.
06:18 < hufg:#liferay> could you paste it here?
06:19 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Habve to boot my test system first.
06:19 < hufg:#liferay> i think a long time ago we made a convention to use dl only
06:19 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Hadn't had time to do anything there this week yet.
06:19 < hufg:#liferay> do you use some structure to enable image upload?
06:19 < hufg:#liferay> it's so long ago can't remember
06:21 < hufg:#liferay> ah image_uploader
06:22 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> The path looks like this: /image/journal/article?img_id=2535409&t=1386069661840
06:22 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> And I can't find /image/ in struts-config.xml
06:23 < hufg:#liferay> mm true
06:25 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I would greatly prefer the image uploader, because we often have assets that are relevant for only one page.
