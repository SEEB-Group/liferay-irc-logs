08:20 < modd_:#liferay> hey topolik, do you have a moment to check something for me? I'm curious if there's an 6.2 EE patch for this: https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/commit/e8ab55f3df0e5616698448f921be92072de9fcbc
08:26 < topolik:#liferay> hi modd_, yes
08:27 < topolik:#liferay> should be covered by these 2 fixpacks: 62-ee-sp4 or Â liferay-fixpack-platform-11-6210
08:27 < modd_:#liferay> ok, cool, thx! :)
08:28 < topolik:#liferay> n-p
08:28 < topolik:#liferay> n/p
09:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey topolik -- you still there?
09:26 < topolik:#liferay> hi jardineworks, how are you?
09:27 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik, awesome! how are you doing?
09:32 < topolik:#liferay> not bad :)
09:32 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik, getting ready for DevCon?
09:33 < topolik:#liferay> yup :)
09:33 < jardineworks:#liferay> I wish I could go this year ... if nothing else, I have never been to Germany :(
09:33 < jardineworks:#liferay> next year FOR SURE.
09:33 < jardineworks:#liferay> although my wife is pregnant... so she might like that idea hahaha
09:34 < jardineworks:#liferay> i do though!
09:34 < jardineworks:#liferay> ;)
09:34 < topolik:#liferay> whohoo, congrats!
09:34 < jardineworks:#liferay> \o/
09:34 < jardineworks:#liferay> but that's it man. 2 will be more than enough for me
09:35 < topolik:#liferay> unless you get twins... ;)
09:35 < jardineworks:#liferay> :O
09:35 < jardineworks:#liferay> TOPOLIK!
09:36 < jardineworks:#liferay> My buddy had twins for his first. That must be a nightmare. I remember how hard the first one was as a single -- mostly because you never really know what to do. But TWO?! TWO screaming kids? two sets of diapers, two sets of potty training... ugh
09:40 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik, I have a couple of questions for you actually.
