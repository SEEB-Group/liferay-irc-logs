04:33 < modd_:#liferay> does anyone use liferay with >1 instances in a single installation? I have some issues with logging in into two portals with the same browser :\
04:34 < modd_:#liferay> seems like the cookie with the session id is responsible for it. after logging into one of the instances, the other instance is not reachable anymore as long as the cookie exists
04:59 < Axxell:#liferay> hmmm i have built the web form portlet from the source to make a variation in the funktion of that portlet.. for some reason i get stray </label> tags in the forms, allthough ive only modified things that have had to do with saving the information (i save some extra data and send som extra mails if some conditions are met)... anybody have a clue of this kind of issue with that portlet or if there could be something else which is doing 
05:41 < goku_:#liferay> hi, in liferay is there any search container available with toolbar?
05:45 < modd_:#liferay> Axxell: without any information about the changes it's hard to say. could you post the diffs or anything?
05:45 < modd_:#liferay> goku_: what kind of toolbar?
05:46 < goku_:#liferay> @modd_ like a toolbar with "add" ,"edit","delete" options and search ,on that table.
05:48 < goku_:#liferay> modd_ :  is there any way to implement that kind of toolbar for a table in liferay? .One way i thought of is to create custom taglibs .
05:51 < modd_:#liferay> do you want to show custom entities in this searchcontainer or some liferay entities like users etc?
05:53 < modd_:#liferay> if it's your own entity, you could create an own search container class by extending SearchContainer<MyEntity> and add the attribute searchContainer="<%= new MyEntityContainer(renderRequest, portletURL) %> to search-container tag
05:53 < modd_:#liferay> this will allow you to have a "toolbar" with integrated search
05:54 < modd_:#liferay> and have a look at <aui:nav-bar> and <aui:nav-bar-search>
05:54 < goku_:#liferay> actually i was trying to implement something like this http://adminity.novalx.com/tables.html data table with toolbar
05:56 < modd_:#liferay> I'm not sure but maybe you could have a look at liferay-ui:toolbar-button
05:59 < goku_:#liferay> modd_ : thanks
10:59 < winem:#liferay> hi, we try to update lar-archives over the web-gui and get instant an error "aborted". there is nothing written to the log files. do you have any idea why this happens?
11:01 < winem:#liferay> I'm quite sure that it's not caused by insufficient privileges on the filesystem
