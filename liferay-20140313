04:30 < noctua:#liferay> Hey, I am trying to set a cookie from a Liferay Protlet (extending MVCPrtlet) and used two methods (from this site http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3749199/how-to-set-a-cookie-in-liferay-portlet ) ... but it's not working
04:31 < noctua:#liferay> i have the same problem as the author, but his second code isn't working for me either, because i cant figure out what to write in the constant "SET_COOKIE"
04:31 < noctua:#liferay> i Really hope someone can help me
04:31 < noctua:#liferay> xD
05:40 < noctua:#liferay> thx ... i just deleted it and it worked ^^
05:43 < noctua:#liferay> how can i call a javascript function in the Liferay controller?
