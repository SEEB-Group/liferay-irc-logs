04:30 < noctua:#liferay> Hey, I am trying to set a cookie from a Liferay Protlet (extending MVCPrtlet) and used two methods (from this site http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3749199/how-to-set-a-cookie-in-liferay-portlet ) ... but it's not working
04:31 < noctua:#liferay> i have the same problem as the author, but his second code isn't working for me either, because i cant figure out what to write in the constant "SET_COOKIE"
04:31 < noctua:#liferay> i Really hope someone can help me
04:31 < noctua:#liferay> xD
05:40 < noctua:#liferay> thx ... i just deleted it and it worked ^^
05:43 < noctua:#liferay> how can i call a javascript function in the Liferay controller?
06:46 < modd_:#liferay> why liferay, why? :'(
06:47 < modd_:#liferay> again messing around with liferay.com urls...
06:49 < modd_:#liferay> please stop rewriting urls and making all former urls point to nowhere...
07:30 < mtsr:#liferay> Hey, I'm having trouble finding any good documentation about setting permissions on a dlfileentry through the API. It seems I need to set something on the servicecontext when adding the file to the dl, but other than that it's hard to find. Can anyone point me in the right direction?
07:54 < modd_:#liferay> mtsr: you have to get the resource for your file out of ResourceLocalServiceUtil
07:55 < modd_:#liferay> then change the action id
07:55 < modd_:#liferay> and write it back with ResourcePermissionServiceUtil.setIndividualResourcePermissions
07:56 < modd_:#liferay> forgot about ResourcePermissionLocalServiceUtil.getResourcePermissions to get the information out of the resource...
09:43 < mtsr:#liferay> wow, ok thanks!
