06:16 < rocknroll_:#liferay> hey all, i wanna download wen form portlet from the marketplace but how.. i don't get it
06:16 < rocknroll_:#liferay> web form
06:19 < rocknroll_:#liferay> could they make this any more difficult.. i recall it used to be easy to add portlets and stuff into the portal
06:22 < rocknroll_:#liferay> what the hell is legan entity name and what should I put there
06:32 < rocknroll_:#liferay> right. got it
09:19 < ra2:#liferay> i'm using liferay 6.2 and would like to add required to select component
09:19 < ra2:#liferay> is there one way to do it ?
09:25 < jardineworks:#liferay> ra2, javascript?
09:25 < jardineworks:#liferay> or you could do it server side I suppose and simply reload the page with a message if it is missing
09:27 < ra2:#liferay> jardineworks: on jsp.
09:28 < ra2:#liferay> jardineworks: i found the solution. it's only set  attribute required="true" on aui:select
09:53 < jardineworks:#liferay> ra2, ah -- aui select. I thought you were using a regular <select> :)
09:53 < ra2:#liferay> jardineworks: :)
10:11 < Jusle:#liferay> I want to add code inside html <head></head> of my fresh Liferay 6.2 tomcat bundle installation with welcome-theme. I cannot find proper answer how to do that?
10:22 < Jusle:#liferay> just add it to portal_normal.vm in the welcome-theme directory?
