05:16 < twen:#liferay> Hello
05:17 < twen:#liferay> I'm wondering somthing.. We'll use Liferay soon. I'm wondering how I could build a working group (team, sharing document and discussion) inside Liferay.... or with plugins.
05:18 < twen:#liferay> any suggestions ? I'm starting to dig into that :)
05:54 < modd_:#liferay> rotty3000: didn't you work on the whole workflow stuff in liferay?
07:31 < Axxell_:#liferay> Hey guys, got a problem: everytime i build a new version of my portlet, which uses servicebuilder, i get the following error: myServiceBuilderImpl cannot be cast to myServicebuilder (paraphrasing). This goes away if i restart the server. does anybody have a clue how i would fix this?=
07:59 < Axxell_:#liferay> Anyone?
10:38 < bijoo_:#liferay> twen: yes, of course, that's one of core features. Google "how to create a Liferay site"
10:39 < bijoo_:#liferay> Axxell_ would need stacktrace; please do pastebin to help.
10:40 < twen:#liferay> bijoo_ Well... I was wondering if a lifery site could be or not be used to manage a project with a team ^^
