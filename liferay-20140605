05:16 < twen:#liferay> Hello
05:17 < twen:#liferay> I'm wondering somthing.. We'll use Liferay soon. I'm wondering how I could build a working group (team, sharing document and discussion) inside Liferay.... or with plugins.
05:18 < twen:#liferay> any suggestions ? I'm starting to dig into that :)
05:54 < modd_:#liferay> rotty3000: didn't you work on the whole workflow stuff in liferay?
07:31 < Axxell_:#liferay> Hey guys, got a problem: everytime i build a new version of my portlet, which uses servicebuilder, i get the following error: myServiceBuilderImpl cannot be cast to myServicebuilder (paraphrasing). This goes away if i restart the server. does anybody have a clue how i would fix this?=
07:59 < Axxell_:#liferay> Anyone?
10:38 < bijoo_:#liferay> twen: yes, of course, that's one of core features. Google "how to create a Liferay site"
10:39 < bijoo_:#liferay> Axxell_ would need stacktrace; please do pastebin to help.
10:40 < twen:#liferay> bijoo_ Well... I was wondering if a lifery site could be or not be used to manage a project with a team ^^
10:40 < twen:#liferay> but thanks for the tip :)
10:41 < twen:#liferay> basicall : create a site, add a document & media portlet, and discussion/forum portlet, et voilà
10:43 < bijoo_:#liferay> twen: yes even can make Site Templates on there; in case you need additional team/projs; and can make updates to master template; lots of features, happy projecteering.
10:43 < twen:#liferay> right :)
10:43 < twen:#liferay> I've to discover how to make templates ;) because, you're right there will be lots of projects/site like that
10:45 < bijoo_:#liferay> twen: yep, look at User Guide on Liferay site; it does nice job of explaining details. Of course, best way for non-techie's to play; for a techie, best ways to look at source.
10:45 < twen:#liferay> hehe
10:46 < twen:#liferay> yes sure. I like how Liferay has docs.. very helpful
10:46 < twen:#liferay> as I'm not a Java dev, the learning curve is quite big (coming from PHP, javascript etc..)
10:47 < bijoo_:#liferay> twen: you can do php portlets there too; though reading the source might be hard follow.
10:48 < twen:#liferay> yeah, well... I prefer to be consistent... except if I have external sources of data
10:49 < twen:#liferay> we are building a new intranet, I'm responsible for the tech part. I need to better understand how everything works ^^
10:50 < bijoo_:#liferay> twen: well feel free to ask any questions then. Of course Googling beforehand's nice too.
10:51 < twen:#liferay> I'm used to IRC :) I like to ask questions... and often, other users like you can better interpret the need.. something Google can't :p
10:51 < twen:#liferay> But I still looked at Google ;)
10:52 < twen:#liferay> interpret : my project <-> liferay site
10:52 < twen:#liferay> :)
10:59 < bijoo_:#liferay> twen: indeed; I'm a huge fan as well here.
10:59 < twen:#liferay> :D
11:03 < twen:#liferay> thanks
