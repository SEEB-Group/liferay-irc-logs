05:45 < martin3k:#liferay> hi guys i am encountering a funny problem. starting up liferay using the wizard it connects seamless to the mysql database. all tables are created. after a restart of liferay it seems to dont connect to the database anymore (catalina.out: http://pastebin.com/UraECNCH) any ideas?
06:16 < nancy:#liferay> Hi how to remove welcome to liferay text from the header after logo?
06:23 < nancy:#liferay> Can anybody pls help me out?
06:37 < nancy:#liferay> Hi how to remove welcome to liferay text from the header after logo?
08:13 < Yam``:#liferay> jardineworks, I fixed my portal without reseting it so I'm ready to go on :)
08:13 < Yam``:#liferay> <jardineworks> from the tool bar on the side choose the + , then choose applications, find the YAM category and drag your portlet onto the pag
08:13 < Yam``:#liferay> e > done that, it works
09:14 < nancy:#liferay> Hi how to remove welcome to liferay text from the header after logo?
09:19 < jardineworks:#liferay> Yam``, ok -- now, in eclipse, under your project you will find docroot/view.jsp. Take you html (minus the <html><head> and <body> tags and paste it into there. You're basically taking the body contents for the page and putting them in the portlet.
10:09 < Yam``:#liferay> jardineworks, so how do I put the CSS and JS files?

11:21 < modd_:#liferay> I have a portlet which creates a user, a site using a template and assignes the user to the site and gives him site admin role. everything works fine except one problem: the site appears in the control panel but not in the my sites-navigation. checking the db it has pageCount=0. after clicking on the site in the backend (so it shows the site config) the site also appears in the my sites navigation
11:22 < modd_:#liferay> seems like it uses the template for the site but doesn't create the pages until I do some action on the site
11:22 < modd_:#liferay> am I missing some API call?
11:24 < modd_:#liferay> I tried GroupLocalServiceUtil.updateSite(group.getGroupId(), true); and LayoutSetLocalServiceUtil.updatePageCount(group.getGroupId(), false); but nothing helps so far
11:25 < jardineworks:#liferay> Yam``, put them in the css and js folders and then reference them with the path /js and /css
11:26 < Yam``:#liferay> just like in <head></head but without one?
11:26 < jardineworks:#liferay> right
11:26 < Yam``:#liferay> ok thx
11:27 < jardineworks:#liferay> Yam``, normally I try to put all my css and js in a theme-plugin, but for now, keep it simple :)
11:27 < Yam``:#liferay> I'll try that and if I don't have any problems I'll listen to your suggestions :)
11:27 < jardineworks:#liferay> haha
11:29 < Yam``:#liferay> fyi I removed the html folder in [liferay-portal]/[tomcat]/webapps/ROOT and copied the clean one from the archive to fix my dockbar issue
11:29 < Yam``:#liferay> (no loss in content/users or else)
11:30 < jardineworks:#liferay> ah -- good idea. I've had to do something similar before with individual files.
11:51 < Yam``:#liferay> when I pasted my code and copied my resources, what should I do jardineworks, double-clicking the project in the ant tab and if there are not erros I can use the portlet without restarting liferay?
11:52 < jardineworks:#liferay> Yam``, yep. tail -f tomcat_home/logs/catalina.out.... once you see messages that the portlet is deployed, refresh the page.
11:52 < Yam``:#liferay> ty jardineworks
11:54 < Yam``:#liferay> eclipse announced BUILD SUCCESSFUL but tail -f catalina.out shows me errors
11:54 < jardineworks:#liferay> what are the errors?
11:55 < Yam``:#liferay> some java errors, I'll try to paste it
11:56 < Yam``:#liferay> the page shows itself but the look of it if very buggy
11:57 < jardineworks:#liferay> Yam``, can you share a screen shot?
11:59 < Yam``:#liferay> yes I will
12:01 < Yam``:#liferay> it seems that the errors are older
12:07 < bijoo:#liferay> martin3k: Did you see the exception in the logs? "java.sql.SQLException: Access denied for user 'liferay'@'localhost' (using password: YES)"
12:07 < bijoo:#liferay> martin3k: seems the username/password may have changed
12:08 < bijoo:#liferay> nancy: not sure which you are referring to there; please send screenshot through picpaste or igmur
12:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> Yam``, change the layout for the page to be a single column
12:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> right now you have the portlet in a left sidebar and your markup doesn't wrap it nicely.
12:13 < Yam``:#liferay> that's right
12:13 < Yam``:#liferay> can we customize the three left buttons (+, view, edit), for example make them red?
12:15 < jardineworks:#liferay> probably through css
12:15 < jardineworks:#liferay> Yam``, now you need to learn how to make a theme :)
12:16 < Yam``:#liferay> jardineworks, being in single column make it wider but there's the same issues : my two tables are one after the other, I don't have the bootstrap panel theme nor do I have the bootstrap buttons (that's not very important)
12:16 < Yam``:#liferay> haha!
12:17 < jardineworks:#liferay> Yam``, for sure the layout issues are markup right? so you'll probbaly have to fudge with it. Remember the generated code from liferay has additional markup that wraps the portlet with its own css and such. Rather than trying to make it pixel perfect within your portlet, I would suggest now trying to make a theme and then putting your js/css etc in there.

12:20 < Yam``:#liferay> what would be the steps so?
12:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> Yam``, in eclipse, right click on the explorer pane -- New > Liferay Plugin Project ... choose Theme as the type and fill in the other fields.
12:22 < Yam``:#liferay> ok, thanks, I'll try that tomorrow
13:33 < modd_:#liferay> :(

14:54 < bijoo:#liferay> modd_: Try doing the following call after
14:54 < bijoo:#liferay> LayoutLocalServiceUtil.getLayouts(groupId, false, LayoutConstants.DEFAULT_PARENT_LAYOUT_ID);
14:55 < bijoo:#liferay> modd_: you could also do a funky thing too
14:56 < bijoo:#liferay> modd_: call PortalClassInvoker.invoke
14:56 < bijoo:#liferay> SitesUtilMethodKey("mergeLayoutSetProtypeLayouts", Group.class, LayoutSet.class);
15:57 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, you around for a licensing question?
