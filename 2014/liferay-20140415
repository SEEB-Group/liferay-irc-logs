06:38 < GeoPlace-Tom> Hello, I'm having a spot of bother with some LDAP config. Originally I set it to use the username from our AD as the login name (eg flintstonef) but now it's been decided we should use the email address (eg fred.flintstone@example.org). I've changed the 'Screen Name' option in the LDAP config but of course all the old users are still showing as the short name. Does anyone know the right way to force a reimport?
11:11 < dave_k> I've got a liferay 6.2.1 instance that's running hot ... 100% CPU without any apparent workload. How can I debug what it's doing wrong?
11:12 < dave_k> or at least which plugin is responsible?
11:17 < dave_k> Trying kill -3 PID gives me a thread dump, but apparently no hint which thread is always busy...
13:18 < Naenyn> rotty3000: you alive? =]
13:19 <@rotty3000> hey yeah, just lots on my plate these days
13:19 < Naenyn> I bet.. you're a busy guy. =]
13:19 < Naenyn> rotty3000: have enough time to answer some hook questions?
13:20 <@rotty3000> I'll do my best
13:20 < Naenyn> \o/
13:21 < Naenyn> so I need to hook in to user creation such that both the standard user creation flow and a custom user creation portlet I'm writing can handle creating users in Liferay as well as creating the associated users in our external CAS-based system. I'm not sure what points I can hook in to, though. I got some general info from other users in here, but could definitely use some specifics on how to determine where I can hook in to.
13:22 < Naenyn> basically, when liferay sees a user creation request, it handles it as normal but then does some extra stuff.
13:23 < jardineworks> Naenyn, Struts hook on the create_account struts action.
13:23 < jardineworks> then you can inject calls to your external system to add the user there as well (assuming it has an external api that you can access?)
13:24 < Naenyn> Yep, it does. What I was hoping for was a list of places I can hook in to. And does it have to be struts? I've zero struts experience. =\
13:24 < jardineworks> mine is almost non-existent as well, but you don't need to know it to do this.
13:24 <@rotty3000> Naenyn: jardineworks is correct, that's one way, you could also use a SerivceWrapper hook on the UserLocalService and basically do AOP like around/before/after on specific method calls
13:24 < Naenyn> another user mentioned a wrapper
13:25 <@rotty3000> Naenyn: jardineworks is correct again about struts, you don't really need to know struts, you only need to understand the servlet/portlet lifecycle depending which one you hook into
13:26 < jardineworks> you can even really cheat by just cloning the liferay class, giving it your own name, and then adding the java you need to add the user in your system :)
13:26 < Naenyn> Hmm.. so, in general, what are the places that can be hooked in to?
13:26 <@rotty3000> service wrappers allow complete integration no matter if it's web services, or the UI's of the portal
13:27 < jardineworks> rotty3000, good point.
13:27 < Naenyn> I have a feeling the service wrapper is the way I'd need to go, then.. because I need to support the same account generation from (at least) two places.
13:28 <@rotty3000> creating a service wrapper on UserLocalService in a hook is as simple as extending UserLocalServiceWrapper and then registering that in the hook xml
13:28 < jardineworks> Naenyn, If you are using the IDE you can see the hooks. Starting in 6.1 you can hook struts actions which introduced a whole whack of additional options.
13:28 <@rotty3000> yeah, from the IDE, both mechanisms are pretty simple
13:29 <@rotty3000> I would go with struts more in the case you need to affect the UI, and service wrappers where you need to affect the business logic
13:29 < Naenyn> Hrm.. not using the IDE.. normally just create empty projects from the maven archetypes and do my work in intellij.
13:29 < jardineworks> rotty3000, while you are watching -- I have some search engine best practices / Q&A for you, but I won't be organized enough to talk about it until tomorrow.
13:29 < jardineworks> hopefully you are around again :)
13:30 <@rotty3000> Naenyn: you don't need the IDE, just more clicky, less typie
13:30 < Naenyn> Makes sense. Although being able to see visually all of the places I could hook in to would be handy.
13:31 <@rotty3000> jardineworks: ping me then, I can't really be sure myself
13:31 < Naenyn> When I was googling for this, I read something about portal.properties having a list.. but that wasn't clear to me when I looked through it.
13:32 < jardineworks> rotty3000, no worries, if you are around I'll give you a shout. Thanks :)
13:32 < Naenyn> rotty3000: jardineworks: and thanks to you both for the info. =]
13:32 < jardineworks> Naenyn, easiest thing for you to do for the hooks. to see them anyway? install the Liferay IDE and create a hook project. There will be a dialogue that lets you pick the hook you want to write.
13:34 < jardineworks> Naenyn, or have a look for the DTD version corresponding to your install. Here is one from 6.0 -- http://www.liferay.com/community/wiki/-/wiki/Main/Hook+DTD+-+6.0
13:34 < Naenyn> I hadn't realized it did that.. I will have to check it out for sure. Although at this point, I think the service wrapper approach will be best.. considering that I need to add behavior for both the normal user creation flow and the new bulk user import I'm writing..
13:34 < Naenyn> ah nice, didn't think about a DTD
13:35 <@rotty3000> our DTDs have traditionally been our best docs
13:37 < Naenyn> another question.. is the "sign in" link (normally located in the top-right in the classic theme) the only way out of the box that Liferay can connect to an external system for authentication? The login portlet is only for local auth, right?
13:37 < Naenyn> found out today I might have to write my own login portlet because of that.
15:44 < Naenyn> doesn't look like the login portlet can be configured to use a different service..
17:08 -!- mode/#liferay [+o rotty3000] by ChanServ
17:28 < jardineworks> Naenyn, YOu can hook the login action and override it with your own logic as well.
17:29 < jardineworks> that is the most common approach, but the login action is also a struts mapping so I suppose you could go that route as well -- easiest way is to implement your own login action though
17:44 < Naenyn> jardineworks: would this be a struts action hook?
17:55 < Naenyn> I kinda get how pre/post event hooking works.. but not completely overriding the action itself.
17:59 < Naenyn> https://www.liferay.com/documentation/liferay-portal/6.1/development/-/ai/performing-a-custom-acti-4
17:59 < Naenyn> guessing that's what you're talking about.
18:00 < Naenyn> altho that example is a pre..
18:18 < Naenyn> jardineworks: rotty3000: So I guess my question is.. how do you override an existing action (in this case, the login action) with a hook?
18:19 <@rotty3000> you simply extend BaseStrutsPortletAction and you'll see there is a method that can call out the existing impl, this way you can go around the impl
18:21 <@rotty3000> there is a method for each major part of the portlet lifecycle
18:21 < Naenyn> ahh
18:21 < Naenyn> is that in the wiki somewhere?
18:21 <@rotty3000> developer guide?
18:22  * Naenyn nods
18:22  * Naenyn tries searching!
18:23 < Naenyn> Think I've got it..
