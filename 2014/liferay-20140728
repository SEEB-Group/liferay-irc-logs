10:54 < circ-user-17zAv:#liferay> Hi, do you know how to change private page order in liferay control panel?
10:54 < circ-user-17zAv:#liferay> I can do it using drag an drop but just for few pages
10:54 < circ-user-17zAv:#liferay> i'm using liferay 6.1
11:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> circ-user-17zAv, if you open your inspector/firebug in your browser, on the console tab, do you see any JS errors starting to show after the first few repositions?
11:01 < bradley:#liferay> join #liferay-dev-life
11:02 < jardineworks:#liferay> bradley, is there a hangout today?
11:02 < bradley:#liferay> no tomorrow
11:03 < bradley:#liferay> I was trying to bookmark it
11:03 < bradley:#liferay> for tomorrow but accidentally put it in the chat.
11:03 < circ-user-17zAv:#liferay> @jardineworks: no, no error shown in console
11:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> bradley, lol -- good thing you did though! I forgot about it :)
11:05 < circ-user-17zAv:#liferay> i can move element until the 20th private pages
11:05 < bradley:#liferay> https://www.liferay.com/community/dev.life/home
11:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> circ-user-17zAv, and then what happens? it just rejects the movement?
11:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> bradley, Are you going to do a session?
11:05 < bradley:#liferay> no, I no longer work for Liferay since Nov. 2013
11:05 < circ-user-17zAv:#liferay> there is no movement..the above label are selected
11:06 < jardineworks:#liferay> bradley, so? I don't work for Liferay and I am doing a session at the end of Oct.
11:06 < jardineworks:#liferay> circ-user-17zAv, weird. But if you move it to the 19th position it works?
11:06 < circ-user-17zAv:#liferay> yes
11:06 < bradley:#liferay> oh I thought it was a liferay only
11:06 < jardineworks:#liferay> bradley, I don't think so. Either that or James is secretly offering me a job lol
11:07 < bradley:#liferay> lol
11:07 < jardineworks:#liferay> bradley, you should ask them if you can do something on front end dev .. theming magic.
11:07 < circ-user-17zAv:#liferay> i have also checked the customization property for that page
11:09 < circ-user-17zAv:#liferay> it seeme that operating on db table called layout, column priority, it works
11:13 < jardineworks:#liferay> circ-user-17zAv, the Layout table is where the "pages" are stored so you could manage it by hand there, but directly changing the database is of course never recommended.
11:15 < circ-user-17zAv:#liferay> i know, but if no other solution ...
11:16 < circ-user-17zAv:#liferay> do you know how drag and drop works?
11:16 < circ-user-17zAv:#liferay> Is it a sort of serveResource call ?
11:16 < circ-user-17zAv:#liferay> ..and it changes the layout value on db ?
11:41 < jardineworks:#liferay> circ-user-17zAv, not sure to be honest, never dug... but yeah I would imagine that its some Alloy scripting that runs. You can probably find it in the ROOT/html/portlet directory somewhere... site or site_admin or something
11:42 < circ-user-17zAv:#liferay> tkz

11:50 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, topolik any chance either of you have time to rubber duck about quartz in a clustered environment?
11:51 <@jhf:#liferay> can’t right now - setting up for dev.life tomorrow! but will be available afterwards...
11:52 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, ok
11:54 -!- mode/#liferay [+o rotty3000] by ChanServ
11:57 < jardineworks:#liferay> rotty3000, gonna keep tryin' -- quartz in a clustered env?
11:57 < jardineworks:#liferay> :)
11:57 < jardineworks:#liferay> I think it's a quartz bug to be honest but having a hard time tracking it down
12:31 < bijoo:#liferay> Hi is Cluster Link only for Lucene? E.g. clustering with Lucene index.
12:31 < bijoo:#liferay> Or is Cluster Link for Ehcache too?
12:31 < bijoo:#liferay> It seems Ehcache has own config there
12:32 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo, 6.2?
12:34 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo, cluster.link.enabled=true is like the master property for more than a few things. Quartz, Lucene, Ehcache to name 3. Anything you need to replicate in a cluster will need that property set I believe.
12:39 < bijoo:#liferay> jardineworks: 6.1; great; thanks for your help here.
12:40 < bijoo:#liferay> jardineworks: having some replication issues there.
12:40 < bijoo:#liferay> jardineworks: noticed cluster link is turned off here.
12:40 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo, I think 6.1 was the same... but I am currently having an issue on 6.1 with quartz jobs in a cluster.
12:40 < bijoo:#liferay> jardineworks: it's the ehcache that's not replicate.
12:40 < bijoo:#liferay> jardineworks: do you have cluster link enabled there?
12:41 < bijoo:#liferay> https://www.liferay.com/community/forums/-/message_boards/message/37571176
12:41 < jardineworks:#liferay> Are you using multicast?
12:41 < bijoo:#liferay> I saw excellent answer by Amos.
12:41 < bijoo:#liferay> jardineworks: no it's Amazon EC2 env there.
12:41 < bijoo:#liferay> jardineworks: have the tcp.xml file.
12:41 < bijoo:#liferay> jardineworks: so it's only two nodes so no big deal.
12:43 < bijoo:#liferay> jardineworks: ehcache replication's elsewhere too.
12:43 < bijoo:#liferay> I mean the configuration's elsewhere.
12:43 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo, I have a 6.2 install right now that is using unicast... I can share my setting with you if you want to try them in 6.1
12:43 < bijoo:#liferay> jardineworks: I have the unicast settings in place.
12:43 < jardineworks:#liferay> including the jgroups in your setenv.sh?
12:43 < bijoo:#liferay> jardineworks: so cluster links seems to take BUS message; and send the BUS message to other nodes.
12:44 < bijoo:#liferay> jardineworks: yes the jgroups as well; with the port nums.
12:44 < bijoo:#liferay> jardineworks: i should mention had it working before;
12:44 < bijoo:#liferay> jardineworks: it's been replicating for a while now; but it was a intermittent issue.
12:44 < jardineworks:#liferay> and at start up you see a big blob of text right?
12:44 < jardineworks:#liferay> ah
12:44 < bijoo:#liferay> jardineworks: it's still an intermittent issue too.
12:45 < jardineworks:#liferay> yeah -- I am having an intermittent issue with quartz on my side.
12:45 < bijoo:#liferay> jardineworks: the GSM message don't show here; that could be a suspect as well here.
12:45 < jardineworks:#liferay> oh
12:45 < jardineworks:#liferay> for me clustering did not work until I saw that message.
12:45 < jardineworks:#liferay> once that message showed up... my search index and ehcache remained in synch (2 node cluster as well)
12:46 < bijoo:#liferay> jardineworks: I changed configs in the props file here:
12:46 < bijoo:#liferay> http://pastebin.com/d3y22Dzk
12:46 < bijoo:#liferay> Basically only change is this line
12:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> (checking..)
12:46 < bijoo:#liferay> 			properties="replicatePuts=false,replicateUpdatesViaCopy=false,asynchronousReplicationIntervalMillis=100"
12:47 < bijoo:#liferay> Liferay OOB is like one below:
12:47 < bijoo:#liferay> 			properties="replicatePuts=false,replicateUpdatesViaCopy=false"
12:47 < bijoo:#liferay> asynchronousReplicationIntervalMillis=100
12:47 < bijoo:#liferay> So the only thing I added was this
12:47 < bijoo:#liferay> asynchronousReplicationIntervalMillis=100
12:47 < bijoo:#liferay> By default it is set to 1000
12:47 < bijoo:#liferay> So this makes it 10 times faster here
12:47 < bijoo:#liferay> 10 times per second try to replicate
12:48 < bijoo:#liferay> As opposed to once per second before
12:48 < jardineworks:#liferay> yikes -- that is quite a bit of additional load no?
12:48 < bijoo:#liferay> On form submit here is what happens:
12:48 < jardineworks:#liferay> if you leave it at every second it doesn't work?
12:49 < bijoo:#liferay> gateway sends POST to the LB; which sends to one of two Liferay Nodes there; one form processes the request ( and is to update a clustered DB); but sends a redirect (a 302); so that the form won't be resubmitted (e.g. if the user click back button something.)
12:49 < bijoo:#liferay> And then LB sends GET to other node; and other node has stale data in it.
12:50 < bijoo:#liferay> jardineworks: no since the redirect is way too fast.
12:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> I see.. so you are trying to beat the request. But the result is that the replication is not always working?
12:52 < bijoo:#liferay> jardineworks: yes, but it was working all of them time; before, that is, I ran auto tests there.
12:52 < bijoo:#liferay> jardineworks: something's happened whereby it's issue now; come to think of it we applied some patch; I'm not sure how that may have affected.
12:53 < bijoo:#liferay> jardineworks: other option is to turn off the cache here.
12:53 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo, sorry it's monday ... when you say before? you mean before you mean you set it to 100 and it was working without issue and now all of the sudden it stopped wokring consistently?
12:53 < bijoo:#liferay> I might turn off to buy some time here.
12:54 < bijoo:#liferay> jardineworks: yes sorry I mean before a release ( I mean internal release of product )
12:54 < jardineworks:#liferay> hmm
12:54 < bijoo:#liferay> jardineworks: basically not sure when stopped working; because same issue had happened before; and that setting seems to have fixed it then.
12:54 < bijoo:#liferay> Back then had a lot more time to tinker.
12:54 < bijoo:#liferay> Today need to come up by EOD.
12:55 < jardineworks:#liferay> well, like I said, I am experiencing some frustrating intermittent issues with quartz and clustering in 6.1.1 GA2 right now. I am not convinced that the JGroups stuff is totally solid.
12:55 < bijoo:#liferay> jardineworks: I did one thing before that kinda helped; I did tcpdump on all the nodes; and then loaded result in wireshark.
12:55 < jardineworks:#liferay> I have triggers which I think are misfiring, but for some reason they don't get picked up on their own. They get run in place of the right triggers later on. But sometimes I have no issues at all and all triggers are grabbed and fired.
12:56 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo, and what did you see in wireshark?
12:56 < bijoo:#liferay> date +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S,%3N" > tcpdump.time.txt;  tcpdump -i eth0 -s 65535 -w tcpdump_qa_inst1 tcp port 8009 or tcp port 80 or tcp port 8080  or tcp port 7800 or tcp port 7801 or tcp port 4444
12:56 < bijoo:#liferay> jardineworks: I saw all the messages and the times
12:56 < bijoo:#liferay> we don't have https on there;
12:57 < bijoo:#liferay> in any case it showed time for the SYNCs
12:57 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo, and that's how you determined that messages were missing?
12:57 < bijoo:#liferay> jardineworks: that's how I knew it's cache issue at first ( this is months ago when issue first came )
12:57 < bijoo:#liferay> jardineworks: since I saw one node updated itself; and then the other node didn't update.
12:57 < jardineworks:#liferay> i see
12:58 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo, the form you are submitting, is that a custom form or a Liferay form?
12:58 < bijoo:#liferay> jardineworks: Oh I just remember something real bad: so updated Node 1, it still gave stale. E.g. on the 302-redirect.
12:58 < bijoo:#liferay> jardineworks: custom with Liferay Service Builder obj.
12:59 < bijoo:#liferay> I wonder if have to add config there; but ehcache has default catch-all, no?
12:59 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo, do you have the same problem if you don't use a custom form? like if you just use the LR stuff? (add users, pages, etc)
12:59 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo, catch-all? you mean a default cache? I beleive so...
12:59 < bijoo:#liferay> jardineworks: Yes I think the same issue happens there; I tried settings some logs in the CP; and noticed one server didn't take it; then when cleared the cache, it took the change.
13:00 < bijoo:#liferay> jardineworks: yes I mean a catch-all for all objects.
13:00 < jardineworks:#liferay> yeah -- I think it is the first one defined if I am not mistaken.
13:00 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo, Have you tested the connectivity between the two servers using something like iperf?
13:01 < bijoo:#liferay> jardineworks: you're right "defaultCache"
13:01 < bijoo:#liferay> jardineworks: no I'll look into that right now here
13:03 < bijoo:#liferay> jardineworks: I'd tried telnet but what's iperf good for?
13:03 < bijoo:#liferay> jardineworks: it seems more for performance over there
13:03 < jardineworks:#liferay> testing bandwidth... finding bottle necks etc.
13:03 < bijoo:#liferay> jardineworks: I hope EC2  bandwidth is quite good;
13:03 < bijoo:#liferay> jardineworks: I can try it; checking out now.
13:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> Maybe you are initiating so many syncs with the 10X / second that its flooding or something (I'm totally grasping at straws lol)
13:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> brb
13:04 < bijoo:#liferay> jardineworks: maybe, I tried other settings as well.
13:06 < bijoo:#liferay> [ ID] Interval       Transfer     Bandwidth
13:06 < bijoo:#liferay> [  3]  0.0-10.0 sec  1004 MBytes   841 Mbits/sec
13:06 < bijoo:#liferay> Looks pretty fast to mee here right now
13:33 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo, lol -- yeah i'd say so :)

21:31 < bijoo:#liferay> jardineworks: we called *persistence.clearCache
21:31 < bijoo:#liferay> It fixed issue we were having here; so on each save of entity, we call.
