09:23 < 6JTAAX9RU:#liferay> Hi guys. Happy new year. ;)
09:26 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Has anyone of you ever encountered that Liferay renders articles with the wrong template?
09:26 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I have a couple of templates and each template has a dedicated structure.
09:27 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> So there is the same number of templates and structures.
09:36 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, do any of your structures have more than one template?
09:36 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> No.
09:38 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> So weird. One article is consequently rendered with the wrong template.
09:38 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> When I look into the DB, the article is actually associated with the correct template.
09:38 < jardineworks:#liferay> any chance the default template id in the database is wrong?
09:38 < jardineworks:#liferay> alright then
09:38 < jardineworks:#liferay> lol
09:41 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Mhm.
09:41 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Might be a caching issue.
09:41 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> It actually shows up correctly on live and staging...but only on the box the article was published on.
09:41 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> The others show it rendered with the wrong template.
09:41 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Very strange.

11:22 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Wow...this is really giving me headaches.
11:22 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Great first day of work. *sigh*
11:42 < olafk:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, if it's a caching issue, you can flush the caches in Controlpanel and try again. Also, what version are you on? Do you have a cluster or single machine?
11:46 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Sadly I don't have access to the control panels on all nodes.
11:47 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> We're using a broken clustering setup with a whacky implementation via Quartz that checks for the last publishing action and supposedly flushes the cache.
11:48 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> The odd thing is that I created a new page with a new article using a new template and only retaining the structure...and still the same thing happens. Really odd.
15:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey rotty3000  -- do you have a minute for a question?
15:33 < olafk_:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur using a "broken clustering setup" should give enough hints that who-knows-what might happen in the cache. If you reproduce with a proper clustering setup or on a single node, this would be more valuable
15:34 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> It occurs on a live system we're in the process of replacing. The new system will consist of only one instance and a clustered proxy in front. The problem should be gone there...
15:34 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> But the people working with the old system still have to be able to get their stuff published...otherwise I wouldn't even bother.
15:35 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I guess I'll try some more combinations tomorrow and see if anything can be used as workaround.
15:44 < olafk_:#liferay> how about setting up a proper cluster on the existing machines?
15:46 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Impossible.
15:46 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> The guys who set that up did major changes to the Liferay core.
15:57 < olafk_:#liferay> ouch. Now there's another hint what might have gone wrong. Especially if nobody else is experiencing this behaviour. You didn't mention the version that you are running yet, right? But with major changes to the core it might be hard to update shortly (and it might be what you're already working on)...
15:58 < olafk_:#liferay> I've never seen this behaviour. That doesn't say it's not a problem in Liferay, just a (to me) uncommon problem. But it sounds like one that should have been shared by many if it was present in the unmodified product
16:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> anyone in here happen to be knowledgeable on friendly urls? I am stuck on something.
