05:48 < bhuvana:#liferay> hai to all
05:48 < bhuvana:#liferay> i am new to life ray
05:49 < bhuvana:#liferay> i am using 6.2 community
05:49 < bhuvana:#liferay> http://www.packtpub.com/article/vaadin-portlets-liferay-user-interface-development
05:50 < bhuvana:#liferay> i followed these steps for vaadin project as portlet both 7 and 6 i tried
05:50 < bhuvana:#liferay> but content is not displaying what wrong i did
05:51 < bhuvana:#liferay> pleaseexplain me any one
05:52 < bhuvana:#liferay> hai bijjo
06:26 < bhuvana:#liferay> hai kim____
06:28 < bhuvana:#liferay> hai anteater_sa
07:34 < ferrema:#liferay> hello
07:35 < ferrema:#liferay> i was wondering if there was a way of setting liferay.home in the startup script (eg. catalina.sh)
09:31 -!- mode/#liferay [+o jhf] by ChanServ
09:50 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Hey guys.
09:51 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Anyone got experience with using S3 with Liferay?
09:51 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I'm currently wondering what exactly happens when a document is being requested that is actually stored on S3.
09:52 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Does Liferay stream the content from S3 to the user or is the user being redirected to S3?
09:52 <@jhf:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur: it redirects to S3 I believe. checking.
09:52 <@jhf:#liferay> also I am assuming you are referring to the use of the S3 document library storage hook
09:53 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Yes, exactly.
09:53 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> From what I can see, there is no redirect...Liferay sends a 200 und then I'm receiving the file.
09:54 <@jhf:#liferay> hmm
09:54 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah I think yer right!
09:54 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> That's not good. -.-
09:54 <@jhf:#liferay> https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/blob/4215f8c402c4753dc8fab7c89f06562b6dc8aa8e/portal-impl/src/com/liferay/portlet/documentlibrary/store/S3Store.java#L194
09:54 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> This will cause some f*ed up traffic increase on our Liferay.
09:55 <@jhf:#liferay> wonder if there is a config to disable straming
09:55 <@jhf:#liferay> streaming..
09:55 <@jhf:#liferay> since there seems to be a non-streamed access code in there too
09:57 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I only see getFile() instead of getFileAsStream().
09:57 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> So you see something I don't?
09:57 <@jhf:#liferay> I see both
09:57 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Because getFile() seems to download the file and then return it.
09:57 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Which seems to be just as bad.
09:58 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah, I guess yer right. so when you click on 'download' you want it to be a URL directly to the S3 storage location, not copied to a temp directory and served via liferay (or liferay's web server that fronts it)
09:59 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> It would also be okay if Liferay replied with a Location header and a 301 or something.
10:00 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Because the idea is to have a permanent URL for the document, which is totally unrelated to the actual storage location.
10:02 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah I'm not seeing that option. presumably the connection to S3 requires auth (I see settings for keys and such in portal.propertieS) and the end user (and their browser) can't currently supply this
10:02 <@jhf:#liferay> so the data must be accessed from the (configured for auth) server?
10:02 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> You can set an S3 to public.
10:02 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> We do that actually.
10:02 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Any user can access any file on there if he knows the URL.
10:05 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah I'm not seeing a possibility to configure the store to give you a direct URL vs. streaming the file
10:41 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf,  since you guys are on the subject in a way. Is it possible to access an item that is in the document library (image) outside the portal context? Is that a WebDAV thingee?
10:46 <@jhf:#liferay> jardineworks: that's one way, yeah. I mean, it's still Liferay (via a webdav library) that is serving the file.
10:46 <@jhf:#liferay> so sorta/kinda in the "portal context" still but not really.
10:54 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, is there another way?
10:54 < jardineworks:#liferay> I'm looking for the easiest possible here
10:54 <@jhf:#liferay> what do you mean "outside the portal context"
10:54 <@jhf:#liferay> there is a URL you can get via DL
10:54 <@jhf:#liferay> is that URL acceptable?
10:54 <@jhf:#liferay> it goes through the doclib portlet I believe.
10:57 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, well, I am looking to embed the image in a og:image for facebook... so I need it to be http://host.com/... blah blah blah
10:57 < jardineworks:#liferay> right now the image url I am getting from the journal article is /documents.....
10:57 <@jhf:#liferay> sure, you can prepend it with the portal URL no?
11:02 <@jhf:#liferay> denissignoretto: !
11:03 <@jhf:#liferay> _pier was here yesterday but freenode was DDoS'd so we had to postpone the drawing.
11:03 <@jhf:#liferay> _pier: !
11:04 < _pier:#liferay> here we are :D
11:04 <@jhf:#liferay> ok guys thanks for showing up. the way this works is that I am going to write down the names of each contributor in a string, and SHA-1 hash it and tell you the hash
11:04 <@jhf:#liferay> then I am going to ask a volunteer to pick a random number
11:04 <@jhf:#liferay> and then I will reveal the original string (which you can confirm via your own SHA-1 calculation)
11:05 <@jhf:#liferay> and the (hopefully) random number will reveal the winner :)
11:05 < _pier:#liferay> cool :)
11:05 <@jhf:#liferay> it's not fool proof, because the person picking the number MIGHT be under my influence, but I haven't found a good way to escrow a random number choice
11:05 <@jhf:#liferay> sooooo jardineworks want to be the person to pick the number (not yet though)?
11:06 < jardineworks:#liferay> sure
11:06 <@jhf:#liferay> I have created the winner string. the SHA1 hash is 3d44e6f219449c762226d3b0768a85e12d1262fd
11:07 <@jhf:#liferay> ok jardineworks choose a random number: 1,2, or 3
11:07 < jardineworks:#liferay> 3
11:07 <@jhf:#liferay> ok and the winner is.............................................
11:07 <@jhf:#liferay> .....................................................
11:07 <@jhf:#liferay> brb got a conference call.
11:07 < jardineworks:#liferay> hahah
11:07 < jardineworks:#liferay> suspenseful!
11:08 <@jhf:#liferay> hahaha j/k the winner is meera!!! sorry _pier and denis, tanks for all you for us.
11:08 <@jhf:#liferay> the string was "pier=1,denis=2,meera=3 and this is so you cant cheat"
11:08 <@jhf:#liferay> echo -n 'pier=1,denis=2,meera=3 and this is so you cant cheat' | openssl sha1
11:08 <@jhf:#liferay> (stdin)= 3d44e6f219449c762226d3b0768a85e12d1262fd
11:08 <@jhf:#liferay> dang I was hoping it would be one of the guys that showed up here today!
11:09 <@jhf:#liferay> ah well. I'll get Meera here soon.
11:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> ahhh... sorry _pier I was rootin' for you after the help you gave me yesterday :)
11:11 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah that was nice.. _pier is "The Man" btw!!!!
11:12 <@jhf:#liferay> I had the pleasure of meeting him at last year's devcon
11:13 < jardineworks:#liferay> well, hopefully I will get to meet him at the next one
11:13 < jardineworks:#liferay> I owe him a beer!
11:14 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf,  you were right! just prefix with the host.
11:14 < jardineworks:#liferay> :S
11:14 <@jhf:#liferay> \o/
11:16 <@jhf:#liferay> make sure you are using the portal URL, not "just" the host (as it wouldn't include port # in the case of some non-80 port or something, or may not include the right scheme (http/https))
11:16 < jardineworks:#liferay> another beer for you! .. jesus, I'm going to need a new page soon -- and you a new liver.
11:16 < jardineworks:#liferay> Brian is not going to like me. I am going to have half his staff in the drunk tank at the next event :)
11:18 <@jhf:#liferay> hahahah
11:18 <@jhf:#liferay> as long as you get your client to buy EE he won't care
11:18 <@jhf:#liferay> ;-)
11:18 < jardineworks:#liferay> hhaha
11:18 < jardineworks:#liferay> I'll work on it!
11:18 < jardineworks:#liferay> If I sell some EE, I'm going to expect him to buy me a beer though
11:18 <@jhf:#liferay> hahaha.
11:19 <@jhf:#liferay> you can write it into the contract.
11:19 <@jhf:#liferay> with a bunch of legal jargon
11:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> ".. and no coors light."
12:05 < denissignoretto:#liferay> Hi pier and jhf
12:05 < denissignoretto:#liferay> I'm late ?
12:05 <@jhf:#liferay> yep, you missed it - and unfortunately you did not win the drawing :()
12:05 <@jhf:#liferay> it was close though! you had a 33.33333333% chance of winning.
12:06 <@jhf:#liferay> Meera Prince won
12:08 < denissignoretto:#liferay> accch, ok doesn't matter!!! beeing in the game was enough for me ! :)
12:09 < denissignoretto:#liferay> what was the prize ?
12:09 <@jhf:#liferay> denissignoretto: thanks for all your contributions in any case!
12:10 <@jhf:#liferay> prize was your choice of 1) free training, 2) free symsosium/devcon ticket, or 3) USD 200 gift card
12:11 < denissignoretto:#liferay> Oh yes, I remember now. You wrote it in your award announcement email.
12:38 < denissignoretto:#liferay> by the way jhf, let me say thanks for your work (and Olaf as well) for the attention to community members and their real involvement !
12:38 < bijoo_:#liferay> Awesome way to do drawings by the way.
12:39 <@jhf:#liferay> denissignoretto: you're welcome and fully deserve it :) I wish we had 100 more Denis's :)
12:40 <@jhf:#liferay> bijoo: thx. there's still one possible way to cheat, which would be that I could secretly be in collusion with the person picking the "random" number.
12:40 <@jhf:#liferay> need to find a public source of randomness
12:40 <@jhf:#liferay> that I can't influence
12:49 < bijoo_:#liferay> jhf: haha, we have more trust in you than that!
12:50 < bijoo_:#liferay> jhf: actually, that would be a great portlet ;)
13:18 < _pier:#liferay> Sorry guys got a connection problem
13:18 < _pier:#liferay> :\
13:19 < _pier:#liferay> Congrats to meera!
13:19 < _pier:#liferay> And jhf, thanks for calling me ‘the man’
