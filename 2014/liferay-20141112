15:51 < bijoo_:#liferay> I'm starting to get in theme dev right now; before, I've always mostly worked backend. I'm using Liferay 6.2.1 (otherwise known 6.2 GA2); and I am using jQuery Mobile.
15:52 < bijoo_:#liferay> Currently I mock up a static site; then I convert it to a Liferay theme.
15:53 < bijoo_:#liferay> The conversion is quite interesting; there are many ways to approach this task. I've gone the simplest route I can think of: strip out all AUI and YUI; map over the static files to the theme; then write the app logic in theme itself.
15:55 < bijoo_:#liferay> Technically I could still use portlets; but that would take a lot more effort too.
15:56 < bijoo_:#liferay> Since I'd again have to decide same thing: to include AUI for drag n' drop or exclude it and use a page template.
15:56 < bijoo_:#liferay> In any case, interesting workflow; I had stayed mainly in backend so far; but starting to get feel for front-end work.
16:07 < bijoo_:#liferay> It has limitations since sequential; so I only use it when scope is small.
