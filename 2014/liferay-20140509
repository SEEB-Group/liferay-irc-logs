10:02 < aj_> quiet day in the channel. where are all the Liferay folks hiding these days?
10:17 < bijoo_> aj_: hmmm have you tried stepping through the code there?
10:18 < aj_> bijoo_, not yet but I have done this once before and the code I wrote last time made use of the BooleanQuery* objects explicitly.
10:18 < aj_> I remember I tried to use it once before and had no luck... I think its a red herring :)
10:33 < bijoo_> aj_: can you give me example what you want?
10:33 < aj_> bijoo_, I got it working :)
10:33 < bijoo_> aj_: cool, what was it and what was the goal there?
10:33 < aj_> I found that the last guy had created a CustomFacetedSearcher ... whcih of course defines a boolean query.
10:34 < aj_> I changed the SHOULD to MUST for the keyword parsing and query building and it worked.
10:34 < bijoo_> aj_: ah okay, had some custom code in there.
10:34 < aj_> but ultimately..
10:34 < bijoo_> aj_: cool glad to hear it is working here.
10:34 < aj_> what I was trying to do is change the default behviour for search so that instead of the implied "teachers OR pensions" it would be "teachers AND pensions"
10:35 < aj_> but the user only enters teachers pensions as a search query of course.
10:43 < aj_> bijoo_, are you going to enter another plugin into this years competition?
11:20 < bijoo_> aj_: cool; yes! Upgrading the old ones as well. Last year I didn't prep properly there; at the last week, churned portlets for 2 days.
11:20 < bijoo_> aj_: This year I want to plan properly there ;) and maybe submit through my company.
11:21 < aj_> bijoo_, do you work for someone else? or for yourself?
11:23 < bijoo_> aj_: No, I work in my company: SEEB Group
11:24 < aj_> no familiar... snooping :)
11:24 < bijoo_> :)
11:25 < aj_> https://seebgroup.com/ .. is that it?
11:25 < bijoo_> aj_: did you participate in last year's too?
11:25 < aj_> I did not but if I can find some time I would like to this year
11:25 < bijoo_> aj_: yes, that is the company's website there.
11:25 < aj_> where is it located?
11:26 -!- mode/#liferay [+o jhf] by ChanServ
11:26 < bijoo_> aj_: I strongly recommend that you try it; competition will be tougher this year; but the rules have changed too, so never know!
11:26 < bijoo_> aj_: It is based in Washingiton, D.C. there; but most clients are all over the world.
11:26 < aj_> i just love building plugins... I don't really care if I win or not
11:27 < aj_> bijoo_, are you in DC?
11:28 < bijoo_> aj_: my strategy last year was too funny; I thought there is no limit on plugins; so I'll make a quick and dirty plugin; and then put in effort to make some more. The plugin with most effort won me spot; but the quick and dirty one was most used! It got over 300 downloads now; and is one I updated most often.
11:28 < bijoo_> aj_: yes, I live in Washington, D.c. now.
11:29 < aj_> hahaha you did the IRC plugin right?
11:29 < aj_> what are the other ones you did
11:29 < aj_> ?
11:30 < bijoo_> aj_: the IRC channel history too; http://goo.gl/SMte1N
11:31 < bijoo_> the portal statistics has most downloads; and is the "quick and dirty" one above.
11:32 < bijoo_> aj_: but Application Display Adapters; now I wouldn't call it "quick and dirty" .
11:32 < bijoo_> aj_: in beginning, that was my goal for it; just to warm up to submission system.
11:33 < aj_> bijoo_, Are Application Display Adapters different that Application Display Templates?
11:35 < bijoo_> aj_: my bad, Application Display Templates**
11:35 < bijoo_> aj_: comingled Application Adapters
11:35 < bijoo_> aj_: I meant Application Display Templates
11:36 < bijoo_> aj_: have you heard any OSGi news? I saw tweet about some conference there.
11:37 < bijoo_> aj_: heard rotty3000 is going there?
11:37 < aj_> bijoo_, all I know is that rotty is actively spearheading the initiative. may jhf  knows more :)
11:38 < aj_> bijoo_, maybe that is where all the Liferay people have been hiding! :)
11:38 <@jhf> hahahaha
11:38 <@jhf> there was an OSGi “Face to face” meeting for the osgi community in switzerland this week
11:39 <@jhf> rotty and one or two others went to represent Liferay
11:39 <@jhf> Liferay is currently “mostly” OSGi-ified - you can write and deploy osgi bundles to Liferay 6.2
11:39 < bijoo_> aj_: jhf: awesome; OSGi seems a great direction.
11:40 <@jhf> in Liferay 7, Liferay itself becomes a set of bundles
11:40 < aj_> jhf, question... I couldn't find a road map for 7... is there one out there?
11:40 <@jhf> so it’ll be much more modular and so for example you can “remove blogs” (right now, no matter what you do, there will always be blogs-related code in Liferay)
11:41 <@jhf> not yet - one is forthcoming though. we are about to start doing milestone builds of 7
11:41 <@jhf> and once that gets going, product management may find time to start saying what will be in 7
11:41 < bijoo_> jhf: this is awesome; great job on that front there. Looking forward to Symposium there.
11:41 <@jhf> yeah!!! symposium!
11:42 < bijoo_> Symposium in Boston; great spot choice!
11:42 <@jhf> there will be a “roadmap” presentation in amsterdam on may 20th
11:42 <@jhf> yeah I’m looking forward to boston
11:42 <@jhf> I got out of being the emcee (finally!) so I’ll have more time to actually enjoy the event
11:42 <@jhf> I’m running the workshops on the day before
11:42 <@jhf> (well.. organizing them - not giving them :) )
11:43 <@jhf> so if you guys have suggestions, I’m all ears
11:43 < bijoo_> jhf: cool! New emcee will have big shoes to fill.
11:43 <@jhf> heh.. thanks :) hopefully he (or she) will do a good job
11:43 <@jhf> I think I know who it will be but not 100% sure yet
11:43 <@jhf> I made some recommendations :)
11:44 < bijoo_> (Knock on wood) I'm sure it'll be great event.
11:44 <@jhf> so on may 20 in amsterdam will be the first official roadmap presentation for 7.0 - hopefully with due dates :)
12:53 < npskirk> Can anyone offer any tips on tracking down the source of "you don't have the roles required to access this portlet"  Can there be more than one cause for it?  (I've turned all the permission checker logs up to "ALL" but they don't log anything when the portlet in question is attempted to be rendered.
13:03 < bijoo_> npskirk: yes, have you tried to debug with source code?
13:04 < npskirk> I do locally when I'm willing to wait 5 minutes for a page load
13:04 < npskirk> Where should I set the breakpoint?
13:05 < bijoo_> npskirk: the Advanced Permission Checker's a start. com.liferay.portal.security.permission.AdvancedPermissionChecker.hasPermission(long, String, String, String)
13:05 < bijoo_> com.liferay.portal.security.permission.AdvancedPermissionChecker.hasPermissionImpl(long, String, String, String)
13:05 < npskirk> I'll try it
13:05 < bijoo_> npskirk: permission systems very flexible; have you look at all Roles Definitions?
13:06 < bijoo_> npskirk: this assuming you're using 6.0+
13:06 < bijoo_> npskirk: you not using 5.2 or below right?
13:06 < npskirk> Yes, I have a fair amount of custom permission configuration in my default.xml
13:06 < npskirk> I'm on 6.1.2
13:07 < bijoo_> npskirk: it's easier to give them quick review. But debugging will give the answer; though you may have to use an IDE; to set breakpoint conditions for ease there.
13:07 < npskirk> Yeah, I use developer studio
13:44 < npskirk> @bijoo_  Frustrating. I have a breakpoint at com.liferay.portal.security.permission.AdvancedPermissionChecker.hasPermission line 967.. This is inside a catch block.  It breaks on the _log() call, but nothing goes in the log, and the exception itself is not available to look at in the debugger.
13:50 < npskirk> can the permission cache be turned off?
14:04 < bijoo_> npskirk: That type of error should print by default; for me it's on line 966 though there.
14:06 < bijoo_> npskirk: can you inspect the Exception object?
14:06 < bijoo_> npskirk: it should have the details you're looking for.
14:06 < npskirk> no, that's what's frustrating
14:06 < bijoo_> npskirk: are you running EE with right source code?
14:07 < npskirk> I get the log printouts like Checking user permission block 1 for 10180 livegame_WAR_egsportlet 11304_LAYOUT_livegame_WAR_egsportlet CONFIGURATION takes 0 ms
14:07 < npskirk> and the break occurs there inside the catch block
14:07 < npskirk> I can see all the object instance variables and function arguments
14:07 < bijoo_> npskirk: you sure the source code matches binary?
14:07 < npskirk> but not the exception
14:08 < bijoo_> npskirk: if so, I'd be happy to do screenshare; perhaps something is setup funny there.
14:08 < bijoo_> npskirk: be right back in 10 minutes; be back soon.
14:08 < npskirk> Well I'm _fairly_ sure — haven't touched my liferay setup in a while
14:13 < bijoo_> npskirk: sometmise EE/CE source differs bit; so if running EE should use that source; otherwise debugger shows wrong line nums.
14:23 < npskirk> bijoo_ I'm all on EE
14:24 < npskirk> 99657644-C3A6-406D-9C19-22D8EC3BD3D7-62797-0000E7639C55B4E3
14:24 < npskirk> oops
14:25 < npskirk> i guess IRC doesn't support sending image clips
14:25 < npskirk> incidentally, I'm breaking at line 966 also
14:25 < npskirk> _log.error(e, e);
15:09 < bijoo_> npskirk: if you want to clear cache, you can there; In CP->Server Administration
15:09 < npskirk> bijoo_ yeah that's what I do
15:13 < npskirk> bijoo_ I may be missing a permission config…  The portlet is one that only appears when I pop it up in an iframe.  I've got a resource permission for some of the info it displays (to hide non-sysadmin info).  That seems to work.  What's odd is that the iframe loads the portlet fine when I pop it up on one page, but puts up the roles message when I pop it up from a different page.
15:20 < bijoo_> npskirk: I'm working on permissions problem too; but it's using site templates and the like; and propagation of permission change; I've found I need to check the database.
15:21 < bijoo_> npskirk: so once you have data, check database; use the debug to find information; e.g. name, primkey, actionId, groupId, viewing user's id, etc.
15:21 < bijoo_> npskirk: I mean, also can keep drilling the code; until you find where it's calling DB.
15:22 < npskirk> bijoo_ I see what you mean — you think its a service call that's failing permission check
15:22 < npskirk> bijoo_ That was my suspicion too — but the fact that the same user can load the portlet on one page, but not on another is confounding
15:23 < bijoo_> npskirk: note that scopes and layout matter a lot.
15:24 < bijoo_> npskirk: in fact, on my issue, I'll keep drilling; I'll isolate what the issue may be; in my case Guest is having permission; where it clearly should not have it there; so I'm going to drill to that method; and find what exactly is makes it think that.
15:25 < npskirk> ugh, the debugger just grinds Liferay to a near halt
15:26 < bijoo_> npskirk: what is the spec on your dev machine there?
15:27 < npskirk> 12 core 2.93Ghz - 32 GB ram
15:27 < bijoo_> npskirk: I can't complain cause it's running perfect; but i7 laptop with SSDs; and plenty RAM to give to IDE.
15:27 < npskirk> running on a raid1
15:27 < bijoo_> npskirk: well that's a beast; what's eclipse's config?
15:27 < npskirk> Good question
15:28 < bijoo_> npskirk: http://pastebin.com/dFsDTWqC
15:28 < bijoo_> npskirk: that's my config; you could use reference.
15:28 < npskirk> thanks bijoo_
15:29 < bijoo_> sure thing, eclipse.ini should help.
15:32 < npskirk> bijoo_ Wow, is this really necessary?  -XX:MaxPermSize=6g
15:32 < bijoo_> npskirk: probably not, I use a ratio; I always give quarter just to be safe.
15:33 < bijoo_> npskirk: it hasn't adversely affected me; feel free to bump it down to gig or so.
15:33 < bijoo_> npskirk: in eclipse case, it's even more than that; just cause it's a hungry puppy sometimes.
16:04 < npskirk> bijoo_ thanks for your ideas, ttl
