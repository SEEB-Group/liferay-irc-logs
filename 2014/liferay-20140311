05:05 < Axxell:#liferay> Hey guys im trying to find out what you can use for sorting in  assetEntryQuery.setOrderByCol1, what i want to use are some of the fields i have in my structure
05:20 < Axxell:#liferay> anyone?
05:54 < wench:#liferay> Axxell try the forums, this channel is not active most of the time
05:55 < Axxell:#liferay> wench: been trying to find any info from before, the forums dont seem much better with getting answers from... usually no answers and if any answers come its more weeks than days
05:55 < wench:#liferay> unfortunately, I help you cause I don't have any information regarding assetEntry
05:56 < wench:#liferay> I'll try to search the guide, and I'll send you any information I can get
05:56 < wench:#liferay> yes that how is always works, unless you have a license
05:57 < wench:#liferay> but it is better than nothing
05:59 < Axxell:#liferay> yeah what ive done is have a structure for an article, one of the fields is a date. Now i want to sort the articles by that date in the structure
06:02 < wench:#liferay> check this out: https://www.liferay.com/community/forums/-/message_boards/message/17237198
06:07 < Axxell:#liferay> yeah got it to work that far, but it only sorts with assetentry column types, i need to find out how i would sort according to article structure fields
07:05 < Axxell:#liferay> hey, wasnt there a tag of sorts to split an article, a webcontent, int multiple pages in the web content display?
07:20 < Axxell:#liferay> never mind, found it, it was @page_break@
07:20 < Axxell:#liferay> wench: btw ended up doing a new class for my data and using sorting with lists
09:03 < wench:#liferay> Axxell, glad it worked. I'll hold as a reference if I need something with assets :)
10:12 < Axxell:#liferay> wench: actually i didnt find a solution, how i would sort assetentrys by a custom field in the assets structure.. will try another solution in the meanwhile and post a question on the forums
