05:59 < Axxell> Hi guys, im trying to find out how to make content in a custom portlet searchable trough liferays standard search. The portlets gets its data from ldap and is not stored in a db. I need to add the data to the lucene index and somehow tell liferay to point to the right page when searching
06:00 < Axxell> Does anyone have a link to an example how to do this? Or a somewhat complete instruction how to get it done?
07:07 < alex_> hi! I dont have "File Upload" on my metadata fields on Liferay 6.2.  Does anyone know if was removed? 6.1 used to have it as this screenshot suggests https://www.liferay.com/c/document_library/get_file?groupId=14&uuid=df661c27-fdbe-49db-9803-d14aa4d00603
07:18 < Axxell> Ive found some examples of a custom asset in liferay, a little unsure though how things work? can i just add an asset of any made upp class? If i make a class to hold the data of my content? Does liferay automaticly index added assets? Do i need to make custom indexer for it to be able to find my asset in the search?
09:22 < bijoo_> Naenyn: yes, that would work; examples are there too.
09:51 < bijoo_> alex_ yes it seems it was taken out some point ./portal-web/docroot/html/portlet/dynamic_data_mapping/js/main.js
09:51 < bijoo_> Axxell look into liferay-portlet.xml
16:39 < Naenyn> bijoo_: it appears that my user stays logged in when returning empty credentials. =( digging more...
17:27 < bijoo_> Naenyn: do they have SSO browser cookies? Could it be other filter's logging them?
18:02 < Naenyn> bijoo_: not unless liferay is doing that out-of-the-box. I don't have any custom filters.
18:02 < Naenyn> just the CAS one.
18:07 < bijoo_> Naenyn: correct, I think it does out of the box. You can check out few ways on that here; easiest is through the control panel: com.liferay.portal.servlet.filters.sso.cas.CASFilter
18:07 < bijoo_> By the "CAS one" you mean the custom one?
18:07 < bijoo_> Or you mean the OOB CAS filter?
18:52 < Naenyn> bijoo_: I'm using that filter. I'm also using a modified version of the CASAutoLogin .. I tried doing the same behavior as CASAutoLogin does for handling "no such user" (redirect, cas logout) but that doesn't seem to invalidate the session.. the user appears to still be logged in.
19:52 < bijoo_> Naenyn: hmm have you tried debugging through the code?
21:03 < ra2> hey guys ! what's necessary to be a Liferay's Golden Partner ?
