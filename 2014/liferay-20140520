05:53 < dave_k1> hey all ... we're thinking about re-using the userids from a legacy system while importing them into LR6.2. how can we explicitely set the userId of a new, programmatically generated user? -- or is it a bad idea?
06:01 < modd_> you can setUserId() and update the user
06:01 < modd_> but I wouldn't do it
06:01 < modd_> why would you want to reuse old ids of another system?
06:02 < modd_> you could add an expando to your user and transfer the old id into this field
06:02 < dave_k> would setUserId also change references?
06:02 < modd_> I don't think so
06:04 < dave_k> modd_: it would make it easier to import the data from the old system.
06:04 < modd_> does your new system already exists?
06:04 < modd_> or do you want to migrate into a new liferay?
06:06 < modd_> you cannot simply mix the databases of two installations, it's not only the user table but everything, which could simply blow up
06:07 < dave_k> old system: legacy php stuff that started with PHP2. new system: fresh liferay 6.2 with standard database scheme + modified clean database scheme of old php system
06:08 < dave_k> but as we know that migrating a DB designed by a PHP noob is not side-effect-free, we would like to keep the userIds...
06:10 < modd_> you could create another table which matches old and new ids
06:10 < dave_k> the other option would be a translation table to translate between them...
06:12 < dave_k> ... but as we know that that userId is also the Customer ID on company letters, identifying the user in all communication, we would need to change some UI so that the staff wouldn't be irritated
06:14 < modd_> how about creating an own service with the service builder, which also provides some methods you can later use and fill its table by hand with your existing data
06:16 < dave_k> that's already on our schedule. current question is: how can we match the old userIds with liferay?
06:17 < modd_> screennames?
06:18 < modd_> i don't know your old tables content, so I cannot tell you how to get them together
06:19 < dave_k> screennames are already present in the old system, used as login name
06:20 < dave_k> sure, I'm aware of you not knowing our old system ;)
06:22 < dave_k> we know that re-using the userId in liferay would be the easy way for us. what we do not know are the side-effects of this approach in liferay.
06:29 < modd_> the userId appears everywhere in the DB. if you manage to get all ids replaced, it might work just fine afterwards
06:43 < dave_k1> modd_: okay, thanks for your opinions. looks like we're stuck between a rock and a hard place. either play surgeon in liferay or in the migrating DB or in our code when we translate between them...
06:45 < modd_> if it would be my task, I'd start with the service builder and let generate a table with userId and phpUserId. then get my sqldeveloper up and fill the table with liferays user id and phps user id where lr.screenname = php.screenname
06:45 < modd_> then restart liferay and everything'S fine ;)
06:50 < dave_k> yeah, and on creating our portlets to make use of the data in the migrated DBs, we'll always have to juggle with two types of user IDs... error-prone, if you ask me.
06:56 < modd_> for all liferay related things use the liferay user id, for all legacy stuff MyServiceMatcher.getLegacyId(liferayuserid)
07:10 < dave_k> yeah, I fear that's the way to go...
07:35 < sm`> hello... im getting new error http://pastebin.com/7BBQt2f8
07:35 < sm`> when i try to open portlet.xml and liferay-display.xml
07:35 < sm`> i installed two new plugins and this problem occured
07:35 < sm`> i removed them both
07:36 < sm`> but the problem is still there
07:36 < sm`> so i guess that was not the case in the 1st place
10:29 < bijoo_> sm`: is this Liferay issue or IDE?
10:46 < sm`> liferay IDE
11:00 < bijoo_> sm`: Gregory Amerson is heading that; he responds lightning fast to messages; http://www.liferay.com/community/forums/-/message_boards/category/4627757
12:59 < aj_> hey rotty3000 -- do you have a minute for a struts hook question?
13:01 < aj_> rotty3000, I have created a struts hook for the edit web content action. In a JSP Hook I have added a few fields to the schedule.jsp page. The struts hook will check for the field values and take action accordingly. In my custom hook class I first execute the originalStrutsPortletAction since I want the default behaviour of saving the data to happen. Then, afterwards I added my logic.
13:02 < aj_> question is -- do you know if it is possible to get the article Id? because my custom logic records some details in a service builder implementation and I need the article Id as part of the information being persisted.
13:02 < aj_> I can't see a way to get it though. The request map has an "articleId" parameter for newly created content, this is not populated.
13:53 < aj_> bijoo_,  you have any thoughts?
13:58 < modd> aj_: have a look at the original portlet action. it will show you how to get the article id
14:02 < aj_> modd, I'll try that but I'm not sure. When the item is being created for the first time the articleId would be generated right? so the original action probably doesn't need it or care that it is missing. lemme have a look though.
14:03 < modd> it will create an articleId, yes, but every version of one article has an own id
14:03 < modd> have a look at the journalarticle table in your db
14:17 < aj_> modd, that much I know already. Whenyou perform a save action in the control panel though the CMD value (for new content) will be "add" so it doesn't need the article ID to perform the action. The article is created and (assuming you have auto generate Ids enabled) it will create an ID for you right? but when that action completes you have the new article in the database but there is no return on the process action method -- so the article object
14:17 < aj_> does not comeback. My struts override hook does more stuff after the save, so I need that ID. If you are updating existing content, then the ID is passed in as a parameter becuase the content already exists.
14:27 < modd> you could try to fetch the article by name
14:31 < aj_> too bad I can't get access to the JournalUtil ... there is a getRecentArticles in there.
14:32 < aj_> gonna see if it gets added to the request under the webkey JOURNAL_ARTICLE.
14:34 < modd> JournalArticleLocalServiceUtil?
14:35 < aj_> modd, I didn't see anything readily available in there when I scanned it, but maybe I'll check again.
14:36 < modd> maybe getLatestArticle(long groupId, String className, long classPK)
14:46 < aj_> modd, yeah I looked at that one but didn't try it. Seems like a good option though. I am just worried about multiple content authors working at the same time and possible collisions.
14:48 < modd> what about dynamicQuery()
14:49 < modd> or getArticles(long groupId, long folderId), iterate through the list and check for the title/content
14:50 < modd> or getLatestArticleByUrlTitle(long groupId, String urlTitle, int status)
14:50 < aj_> modd, sure -- all options, but don't they feel a little on the hack side? I mean, an ID is generated... I just want to make sure that there isn't a way to get it back by that first.
14:51 < modd> instead of overriding the class I would add an model listener to the JournalArticle model and use onAfterCreate() and onAfterUpdate()
14:54 < aj_> modd, I can't, I need details from the (JSP) request to determine whether or not I need to do anything. Essentially what I am doing is providing the ability to set "precision" publishing instead of a "window". So if you say Tuesday May 20 at 4:00pm EST and check the "precision publishing" box then I will dynamically create a scheduled job to force publication of this content item at the time specified.
14:55 < aj_> In order to do that I need the extra fields on the JSP. I add the struts hook but use the original to do all the stuff I need to do anyway (add/update the content details).
14:55 < aj_> Like I said, it works fine with "update" commands, its the add that is a pain. Perhaps I just need to make the restriction that you have to save as draft at least first.
14:56 < modd> well, then it's better to get the article again, because it will do what you need and no user will complain about the usage
21:31 < bijoo_> aj_: I know exactly the issue you mean; my suggestion is to also do this: override the Journal Service Impl; which is called by original action; and that will give you some more optionss there; 1) create a *ThreadLocal class just for that; and in Impl set article Id; and retrieve it in the post action class. 2) do the logic in the Service Impl.
21:33 < bijoo_> In long term, need to file improve ticket; so that the Ids are exposed somehow. Otherwise OSGi might answer; but I'm not keen on the details here.
21:33 < aj_> bijoo_, In the end I solved it by adding a conditional to the JSP whereby the "precision publishing" fields are disabled unless a draft or published version exists.
21:33 < bijoo_> aj_: that works as well less lots of JSPs.
21:33 < aj_> I added some text to the DIV that is displayed only when the fields are disabled.
21:34 < aj_> the text basically says that you must have either a draft or published content before you can do precision scheduling.
21:34 < aj_> seems to be good enough for now.
21:34 < aj_> thanks though :)
21:34 < aj_> Now I am just wrestling with the scheduling API
21:34 < bijoo_> aj_: great, anytime; glad it's working here.
