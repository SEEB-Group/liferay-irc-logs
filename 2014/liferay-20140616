06:38 < sm`pid:#liferay> Hello
06:38 < sm`pid:#liferay> jardineworks: i tried your suggestion
06:38 < sm`pid:#liferay> put _eGain_WAR_Egainportlet_javax.portlet.action  in the rule
06:39 < sm`pid:#liferay> but didnt work either.
06:39 < sm`pid:#liferay> with such config the linked are not matched with the rule i.e. i dont get the friendly urls
07:02 < sl33k:#liferay> hi guys
07:02 < sl33k:#liferay> grrr
07:03 < sl33k:#liferay> that render/action 2 phase cycle bore things up for spring mvc portlet integration
07:03 < sl33k:#liferay> example, action phase gets student and passes to render method for display.
07:04 < sl33k:#liferay> next time that display runs, if student isnt set, it shows null
07:04 < sl33k:#liferay> this is bad

08:00 < modd_:#liferay> hi lundgren
08:00 < modd_:#liferay> I heard you are "the man" for workflows ;)
08:09 <@lundgren:#liferay> modd_: well... depends on what part of it
08:09 < modd_:#liferay> we want to replace kaleo with camunda
08:10 < modd_:#liferay> does any kind of documentation exist, which gives some hints what we have to implement and what not to forget while doing it
08:10 < modd_:#liferay> we want to use camunda for all liferay workflows
08:10 < modd_:#liferay> like the activity portlet
08:11 < modd_:#liferay> but as an extern server
08:12 < topolik:#liferay> sl33k: the action phase is for UPDATE, render phase for READ operations
08:13 < topolik:#liferay> sl33k: by UPDATE you should update the application state = DB / session
08:14 < topolik:#liferay> sl33k: in READ you should not change state and only read prepared data, render phase response could be cached based on render parameters
08:15 < topolik:#liferay> sl33k: AFAIK spring portlet mvc worked OK when I used it
08:36 < modd_:#liferay> so, any idea?
08:57 < modd_:#liferay> :(
08:58 <@lundgren:#liferay> modd_: For that part I recommend you to contact marcellus.tavares@liferay.com
08:58 <@lundgren:#liferay> He is maintaining Kaleo now
08:58 < modd_:#liferay> ok, thx

11:14 < jardineworks_:#liferay> hey guys -- I have a question. I just created a new portal instance however I can't log into it.
11:14 < jardineworks_:#liferay> I checked the users table and I can see that there are no users with a company id that matches the new instance id
11:15 < jardineworks_:#liferay> so how do I log in to configure this instance? am I supposed to use the omni.admin ext property fro this?
11:15 < jardineworks_:#liferay> surely there is a better way...
