05:25 < wohnout:#liferay> Hi all, I have proprietary SSO service from liferay to external apps. I'm trying to redirect to external app after successful login. Everything works great except that I need to open portal once before the login is propagated to external app
05:25 < wohnout:#liferay> do you have any advice what to call to "start" session

07:13 < modd_:#liferay> hi. as far as I see here https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/blob/master/definitions/liferay-workflow-definition_6_2_0.xsd the onTimer execution type is not available at all, or did I miss something?
07:48 < itman:#liferay> Hi guys
07:49 < itman:#liferay> can someone help me connect ruby 2.0 with liferay 6.1
07:51 < itman:#liferay> I can't found google unfortunatly
08:02 < wohnout:#liferay> Is somehow possible to trigger login.events.post when using CustomLoginAction?
08:10 < modd_:#liferay> does PropsUtil not work?
08:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> wohnout, What do you mean trigger? if it is configured in the portal-ext then it should fire
08:18 < wohnout:#liferay> Well I'm redirecting to external application upon login but if I use redirect parameter then there is no call to Main Servlet so the login.events.post is not triggered.
08:21 < modd_:#liferay> read the value of this property in your custom action and create and call the class by hand
08:23 < wohnout:#liferay> modd_: that PropsUtil was on me ? :)
08:23 < wohnout:#liferay> that PropsUtil answer
08:25 < modd_:#liferay> I thought you are were asking how to get the value of the property...sry
08:25 < modd_:#liferay> -
08:25 < modd_:#liferay> *
08:25 < wohnout:#liferay> nono I need to call that action
08:28 < wohnout:#liferay> and EventsProcessorUtil.process can't be called from CustomLoginAction

12:23 < barrie:#liferay> Quick question.. what version of 6.1 is the first to fully support PACL for Marketplace apps?
13:13 <@jhf:#liferay> it was introduced in 6.1 CE GA2 but had many issues which were resolved in 6.1 CE GA3 (and 6.2 CE GA1)
13:14 < modd:#liferay> hey jhf, did you know, that lr partners are not allowed to support CE?
13:15 <@jhf:#liferay> yup, I did know that
13:15 < modd:#liferay> pretty sad
13:15 < modd:#liferay> coming from "a nice little portal for my church" to "don't you dare to help CE people" is a deep fall
13:19 < modd:#liferay> following this rule I'm not allowed to be here and answer questions :\
13:24 <@jhf:#liferay> you can participate in the community as a partner - it increases your chances of winning EE deals through what is essentially advertising of your expertise.
13:25 < barrie:#liferay> PACL question...
13:25 < barrie:#liferay> I got this error
13:25 < barrie:#liferay> Caused by: java.security.AccessControlException: Access denied (com.liferay.portal.kernel.security.pacl.permission.PortalServicePermission service#portal#com.liferay.portlet.asset.service.AssetTagLocalService getGroupTags)
13:25 <@jhf:#liferay> hey, rotty3000 is back!
13:25 < barrie:#liferay> but have this in my PACL definition
13:25 < barrie:#liferay>    com.liferay.portal.service.GroupLocalService#fetchGroup,\

13:26 < modd:#liferay> -> pastebin.com
13:26 < barrie:#liferay> ahh .. yea.. thanks
13:26 < barrie:#liferay> http://pastebin.com/cFtM1pV0
13:42 < barrie:#liferay> So this is weird... I regenerated the PACL http://pastebin.com/dScuRUex
13:43 < barrie:#liferay> and it now has two entries for  com.liferay.portlet.asset.service.AssetTagLocalService#getGroupTags
13:43 < barrie:#liferay> one at the top... and one where it was before...
13:43 < barrie:#liferay> is PACL order sensitive?
13:43 < barrie:#liferay> or a possible bug
13:50 < barrie:#liferay> I removed the top one.. and tested again .. and it worked.. so maybe just a fluke
