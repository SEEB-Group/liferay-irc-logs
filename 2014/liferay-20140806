04:54 -!- Irssi: Join to #liferay was synced in 9 secs
05:12 < Yam`:#liferay> already woken up jardineworks?
09:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> Yam`, I am now. Sort of anyway.
09:10 < Yam`:#liferay> haha
09:10 < Yam`:#liferay> that's because you joined at 10:47 FR, I was surprised! you must have disconnected in fact
09:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> Yam`, ah -- I never turn my computer off so you may see me as in the room but I might not be at my machine.
09:17 < Yam`:#liferay> yes that's just the connection which misleaded me :)
09:18 < Yam`:#liferay> jardineworks, what does the underscore before the private function _getUsersInOrganization you write me yesterday is for?
09:23 < jardineworks:#liferay> Yam`, it doesn't mean anything... it's just a convention that some people use to indicate a private member/method
09:42 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo_, you around?
10:04 < Yam`:#liferay> jardineworks, okay, I've never seen that before
10:27 < jardineworks:#liferay> Yam`, it's not one of the "standard" practices... but I like to use it.
10:28 < jardineworks:#liferay> my wife is a user experience designer ... so I get a lot of tutorials on the importance of visual queues etc.
10:28 < jardineworks:#liferay> :)
11:04 < Yam`:#liferay> jardineworks, ok :)
11:13 < bijoo:#liferay> soloslinger: respectfully completely disagree :)
11:37 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo,  do you know which class is responsible for populating the urls? Not sure how to ask this lol... you know how every link has an absolute path -- I am trying to figure out which class(es) in the Portal Core actually do it.
11:39 < bijoo:#liferay> jardineworks: hey yes; are you using taglib to make ?
11:40 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo, possibly... I take it that means that there is not a "single" point where this work is done?
11:40 < jardineworks:#liferay> I was looking for some kid of JSP post-processor or soemthing
11:42 < bijoo:#liferay> jardineworks: com.liferay.taglib.portlet.ActionURLTag
11:42 < bijoo:#liferay> jardineworks: RenderURLTag extends that class
11:42 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo, I can see in the PortalImpl there is a getPortalURL that looks like it does the full assemly...
11:42 < bijoo:#liferay> jardineworks: besides taglib, there are util classes: com.liferay.portlet.PortletURLUtil
11:43 < bijoo:#liferay> ActionURLTag shows most of it; let me know if that doesn't satisfy
11:47 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo, Ah.. LiferayURLGenerator*
11:51 < Yam`:#liferay> I want to read data from another database than lportal following this tutorial http://srikanthliferay.blogspot.fr/2014/03/connecting-to-different-database-using.html but when I do build service, it creates the "sql" folder but nothing in there, can somebody help me?
11:54 < bijoo:#liferay> Yam`: in middle of something at the moment; feel free to post configs (pastebin) here; and will check when get a breather here.
11:55 < Yam`:#liferay> I may have forgotten to create a new service builder (I created only the service.xml file)
11:55 < Yam`:#liferay> bijoo, what do I have to set in "namespace" field while creating a new service builder?
11:56 < bijoo:#liferay> Yam`: <!--
11:56 < bijoo:#liferay> The namespace element must be a unique namespace for this component. Table names
11:56 < bijoo:#liferay> will be prepended with this namespace. Generated JSON JavaScript will be scoped
11:56 < bijoo:#liferay> to this namespace as well (i.e., Liferay.Service.Test.* if the namespace is
11:56 < bijoo:#liferay> Test).
11:56 < bijoo:#liferay> -->
11:56 < bijoo:#liferay> liferay-portal-src-6.1.1-ce-ga2/definitions/liferay-service-builder_6_1_0.dtd
11:57 < bijoo:#liferay> Yam`: the dtd explains the fields nicely
11:57 -!- mode/#liferay [+o rotty3000] by ChanServ
11:57 < Yam`:#liferay> ok, thanks bijoo
11:58 < bijoo:#liferay> Yam`: anytime Yam` ; that's what this channel's for :)
11:58 < Yam`:#liferay> But I don't have the dtd, I don't have the "src" portal
12:05 < bijoo:#liferay> Yam`: you can download; Liferay is open source.
12:07 < Yam`:#liferay> that's what I just did :)
12:08 < Yam`:#liferay> Even with the service builder I still have the problem I said earlier
12:08 < Yam`:#liferay>  I want to read data from another database than lportal following this tutorial http://srikanthliferay.blogspot.fr/2014/03/connecting-to-different-database-using.html but when I do build service, it creates the "sql" folder but nothing in there, can somebody help me? > I don't have the files created in the sql folder at the end of step 1

13:58 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo, lemme run something by you.
13:59 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo, someone is asking me to make all the urls relative. I'm thinking that this would not work for a few reasons, the most important of which -- removing the domain means that any subsequent request would be sent to the default company. So in a multiple company (instance) environment, you would break this feature.
13:59 < jardineworks:#liferay> Thoughts?
14:00 < bijoo:#liferay> jardineworks: well relative should still work in that case? Since browser will keep user same domain.
14:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo, right... good point. I think I need a coffee. So in that case, why does liferay use absolute paths I wonder
14:03 < bijoo:#liferay> jardineworks: let me think about that, it's good question.
14:03 < bijoo:#liferay> jardineworks: I'd say since it is less ambiguous ; but I'm not sure if that's the technical; there may be very good reason it is.
14:06 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo, there are a few open tickets about it where people are complaining -- and Jorge says its better, but doesn't really elaborate
14:07 < jardineworks:#liferay> https://issues.liferay.com/browse/LPS-32097
14:07 < bijoo:#liferay> jardineworks: I guess, what's the reason not to have it?
14:07 < jardineworks:#liferay> "There are sometimes in which a full URL is needed. For example when switching the protocol (like from http to https)"
14:07 < jardineworks:#liferay> but you could manage that at the proxy easily enough
14:07 < jardineworks:#liferay> or just make it inherit whatever protocol the user sends
14:08 < bijoo:#liferay> jardineworks: so liferay has some properties for that; to force to just use https; maybe because of that needs absolute
14:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo, I guess... but again, it makes more sense to do that at the proxy if you ask me
14:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> isn't that one of the reasons rewrite rules were created? :)
14:09 < bijoo:#liferay> jardineworks: proxy can't process the html?
14:10 < bijoo:#liferay> I mean when portal sends HTML; it embeds absolute URLs there.
14:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo, I think it can, I dunno... not my domain. But my client is saying that he doesn't want to do anything at the proxy.
14:18 < bijoo:#liferay> jardineworks: client say why they need relative URL?
14:20 < bijoo:#liferay> jardineworks: Bug you mentioned cites security holes; not sure what exactly referring there.
14:20 < bijoo:#liferay> jardineworks: and they can get EE to help with that; since LRs give indeminfication
14:20 < bijoo:#liferay> since LR gives* indeminfication
14:26 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo, no really good argument from what I can gather. Feels to me like work that should be done at the proxy is not and there is a decision being made to keep it that way, but I don't understand why
14:39 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo, for the record... PortletURLImpl.generateToString() is where all the magic appears to start.
20:01 < bijoo:#liferay> jardineworks: cool, thanks; appreciate the follow up.
