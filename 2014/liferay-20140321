04:48 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> hi there
04:50 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> problem with a form not being populated : https://www.liferay.com/community/forums/-/message_boards/message/35932749
04:50 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> If you have any ideas, I'll take them !
05:16 < nicolas_FR_:#liferay> I have a long jsp with lots of fields, and 2 steps I want to submit info. 1st step is in the middle of the jsp, last one at the end. It's 1 big DynaValidatorForm, and 1st step is here to update some database and go back to the same jsp. Is there any traps doing so ?
05:17 < nicolas_FR_:#liferay> the 2 submits have differents actions, so I set 1st action in the form action attribute, and I generate 2nd action url in a html:link, which href I copy to the form action. Any problem with that ?
05:29 < modd_:#liferay> hi topolik, just a short question. how's the quality of the czech language file?
06:05 < nicolas_FR_:#liferay> anyone know why post data would not appear in the action form ?
06:07 < modd_:#liferay> can you explain the problem a little bit more?
06:07 < nicolas_FR_:#liferay> sure
06:07 < nicolas_FR_:#liferay> I've got 1 form.jsp page
06:08 < nicolas_FR_:#liferay> this page will be submitted 2 times. 1st submit to 1 actionA.do, 2nd submit to another actionB.do. Same DynaValidatorForm, same success page (the form.jsp).
06:10 < modd_:#liferay> submitted two times? how? why?
06:10 < nicolas_FR_:#liferay> First submit is succesfull, actionA gets the form's data and everybody is happy. I then display again the form.jsp with datas from the session form, and I continue to fill my fields. Second submit (changing form action with javascript) is a failure : I enter the action, but my form object is still with parameters from 1st submit. Nothing more.
06:11 < modd_:#liferay> well yes, it's like you submit a form and then press f5 an you'll get the same parameters, eventhough you didn't fill the form the second time
06:12 < nicolas_FR_:#liferay> why ?
06:12 < nicolas_FR_:#liferay> Because : 1 - I change the action url. 2 - my form is filled with new fields. 3 - post data from firebug are good : every fields are filled.
06:15 < modd_:#liferay> let your form load the data from the request. if no data is there you'll have empty values. add another hidden input into the form named redirectTo with the current url of the page. after the first submit get post informations, set these informations into the actionResponse and make a actionResponse.sendRedirect(redirectTo); in your method. the second time the form will be shown oit's a fresh page, but this time with the additional i
06:16 < modd_:#liferay> the part with the redirectTo is my way of avoiding the f5 reload error
06:17 < modd_:#liferay> it's simple and clean
06:17 < nicolas_FR_:#liferay> but it's not a f5 error to me. 2nd submit actually has informations in the post data
06:17 < nicolas_FR_:#liferay> form is actually sent to the action, post data are full of completed fields (which would not happend with a f5 right ?)
06:18 < modd_:#liferay> well, but it's not supposed to be there. with f5 the form is not filled but the data is sent anyways.
06:18 < modd_:#liferay> your problem is indirectly linked to this one
06:19 < modd_:#liferay> don't rely on hidden post data, fill the informations you need by yourself
06:19 < nicolas_FR_:#liferay> ok.. I can try btw.. so.. clearly ...
06:19 < modd_:#liferay> do it explicit insteal of implicit
06:19 < modd_:#liferay> hope it helps :)
06:19 < nicolas_FR_:#liferay> let your form load the data from the request : this is my first submit right ?
06:20 < modd_:#liferay> your form input fields have default values
06:20 < nicolas_FR_:#liferay> I don't understand the solution actually
06:20 < modd_:#liferay> set these values with the content of the parameters you'll get from the request
06:20 < modd_:#liferay> these parameters are empty on the first load
06:20 < modd_:#liferay> but filled on the second
06:20 < nicolas_FR_:#liferay> isn't it automatic with form being in session ?
06:21 < modd_:#liferay> don't use it this way, pass all the informations you need by hand
06:22 < nicolas_FR_:#liferay> all the informations I need ? But it's user's input...not me
06:22 < modd_:#liferay> moment
06:29 < modd_:#liferay> some pseudo code: http://pastebin.com/MzyxPwER
06:29 < modd_:#liferay> first I'll fill foo and bar and submit, then I'll just fill baz
06:30 < modd_:#liferay> after sending foo and bar I'll get these values passed back to my form
06:30 < modd_:#liferay> forget about "value="<%=baz %>"" in the form, it doesn exist..copy paste error ;)
06:32 < nicolas_FR_:#liferay> so what's the difference between renderResponse.sendRedirect, and me doing a mapping.findforward ?
06:32 < modd_:#liferay> I'm redirecting the the page like it was before submitting anything. so the post data is gone
06:33 < nicolas_FR_:#liferay> ok, but the data will still be in the forms right ?
06:33 < modd_:#liferay> and well, it's just my suggestion, you don't have to use it ;)
06:33 < modd_:#liferay> the data will be passed back to the form after the reload
06:34 < modd_:#liferay> in the action method I'm setting the values back into the response so they are available in the request
06:35 < nicolas_FR_:#liferay> give me a moment so I give you the entire view, and then you say me if I'm saved or not :)
06:36 < nicolas_FR_:#liferay> complete view : Users will go through 2 portlets : portletA and portletB. PortletA is a form and gathers some info on user. If users want, after completing portletA, he can continue to portletB, which is another form (the one we're talking about).
06:37 < nicolas_FR_:#liferay> First action in my portletB was a prepareAction, creating my DynaValidationForm in the action, and settings some fields with informations from the portletA (using shared session).
06:39 < nicolas_FR_:#liferay> so when user click on "continue to portletB", they have a new form with some of the data from the portletA. Then they fills some info, submit (so marketing is happy getting some early info), display the form again with their submitted info, complete the form and submit another time (and this one is broken).
06:39 < nicolas_FR_:#liferay> is your solution applicable so ? (dumb question I bet but I don't really get where my problem is :(
06:40 < modd_:#liferay> well, you try to pass informations between portlets. you can use inter portlet communication to pass the informations. the other parts will stay the same
06:40 < modd_:#liferay> so it will work
06:41 < nicolas_FR_:#liferay> cool. So. Now... I should not create my form in the prepareAction and set the values using "renderResponse.setParameter("foo", foo);"... right ?
06:42 < modd_:#liferay> you can do so, it's not a problem, but you will need to define the ipc methods and messages
06:42 < nicolas_FR_:#liferay> ipc ?
06:42 < modd_:#liferay> inter portlet communication
06:43 < modd_:#liferay> liferay has a "baseball-portlet" as an example with "pitcher" and "catcher"
06:43 < modd_:#liferay> I'm sure it's in the web somewhere
06:43 < nicolas_FR_:#liferay> for now I save datas I need from portlet A in the session, and portlet B gets the info from the portletA from the session (as it's shared). Isn't it good already ?
06:44 < modd_:#liferay> it's one way of doing it. I don't think I can say if it's the best way or the worst or whatever...it depends on what you need, what you want and what you can
06:45 < modd_:#liferay> are these portlets on the same page?
06:45 < nicolas_FR_:#liferay> no
06:45 < modd_:#liferay> ok, so no ipc^^
06:45 < nicolas_FR_:#liferay> :)
06:45 < modd_:#liferay> are these informations user related?
06:46 < nicolas_FR_:#liferay> yes
06:47 < modd_:#liferay> then you could add expandos to the user model. portletA gets informations from the form and fills the expando fields, portletB gets these informations with currentUser.getexpandobridge().getattribute("foo")
06:50 < nicolas_FR_:#liferay> oh but currentUser will be a guest
06:50 < modd_:#liferay> so it's not user related^^
06:50 < nicolas_FR_:#liferay> and btw information sharing between the 2 portlets already works..
06:50 < nicolas_FR_:#liferay> sorry I though user related : information specific to the end user : name, address, etc.
06:51 < modd_:#liferay> well, then let it in the session of the user
06:55 < modd_:#liferay> it should work anyway, because you have session stored values and values that are passed from one request to the next. try it
06:55 < nicolas_FR_:#liferay> ok thanks
07:03 < topolik:#liferay> modd_: Hi, 6.1 is complete with good quality, czech UG guys are working on translating 6.2, it's not complete yet (we have a small community, only several active members) :)
07:04 < modd_:#liferay> ok, good to know :)
07:05 < modd_:#liferay> btw. do you have a moment for another problem I see with 6.2?
07:06 < modd_:#liferay> sadly it's IE related :\
07:12 < topolik:#liferay> modd_: You can try, but I can't promise anything :)
07:14 < modd_:#liferay> the problem is with IE9 in IE8 document mode
07:14 < modd_:#liferay> when adding a new page in the frontend, in IE9 doc mode it works fine
07:15 < modd_:#liferay> in IE8 doc mode it loads the edit_layout.jsp as a complete page without theme etc. instead of loading the page
10:33 < plof:#liferay> guys is there a way to disable the chat in liferay 6.2 ?
16:11 < Krugger:#liferay> is there any better documentation than the one found in the wiki and liferay documentation page? I have an extensively modified liferay that needs to be migrated/reimplemented in a recente version.
