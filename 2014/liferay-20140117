05:22 < nicollas_FR:#liferay> hi there
06:01 < Axxell:#liferay> hey guys im trying to do the following velocity thingy in freemarker: #set($footer-content=$journalContentUtil.getContent($axxellCompany, $footer-content-id ,null,"$locale",$theme_display))
06:01 < Axxell:#liferay> but i cant get it to work..
06:01 < Axxell:#liferay> <#assign footercontent = journalContentUtil.getContent(axxellCompany, footercontentid ,null,"locale",theme_display) />
06:01 < Axxell:#liferay> thats im using in freemarker
06:27 <@jhf:#liferay> Axxell: how did you define footercontentid  ?
06:29 <@jhf:#liferay> also, what error are you getting?
08:04 < Axxell:#liferay> jhf: the error is Caused by: freemarker.core.InvalidReferenceException: Error on line 5, column 1 in Axxell.fi-2014.7-fm-styled-theme_SERVLET_CONTEXT_/templates/menusystem.ftl_journalContentUtil.getContent(10194, "10982" ,"view","sv_SE",themeDisplay) is undefined._It cannot be assigned to footercontent [Sanitized]
08:04 < Axxell:#liferay> jhf: i didnt define it beforehand, it should be a string..
08:06 < Axxell:#liferay> jhf: how is it supposed to be done?
08:14 < modd_:#liferay> hi. is there any limitation to the drag&drop feature of the doclib? it works perfectly for jpeg but fails for xls/xlsx
08:16 < Axxell:#liferay> topolik: any ideas what im doing wrong?
08:18 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Hey guys.
08:18 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Anyone around who has experience with PDF/RTF/DOC generation in Liferay?
08:18 < Axxell:#liferay> @jhf: isnt journalContentUtil already available to use in freemarker without anything extra?
08:19 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> We need to export web content articles in different file formats...but we want to influence the way these are rendered.
08:19 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Especially: Add a header and footer to the exported documents.
08:49 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> hi all
08:49 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> still on our minify css problem :( Please take a look at https://www.liferay.com/fr/community/forums/-/message_boards/message/33252429 if you know about minify css, gzip and so on. Thanks
08:51 < satheesh:#liferay> nicolas_FR: Which web server you are using?
08:51 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> apache 2.2.9 + tomcat 6.0
08:55 < satheesh:#liferay> Okay
08:55 < satheesh:#liferay> theme.css.fast.load=true
08:55 < satheesh:#liferay> minifier.enabled=true
08:55 < satheesh:#liferay> This is the recommended way for minifying
08:56 < satheesh:#liferay> If web server is configured in proper way, it takes care of gzipping
09:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, are you guys using open office integration?
09:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, I did PDF gneration once a few years ago (from Liferay) but I built something custom using iText.
09:02 < jardineworks:#liferay> I've never done the Open Office integration but I have read that it is supposed to be easy peasy
09:03 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> satheesh : so you think I'm missing the minifier.enabled= true parameter ?
09:04 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> satheesh: fact is I have theme.css.fast.load=true (I double checked in liferay portal admin page) and it doesn't seems to be in fast load mode..
09:08 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> jardineworks: I'm not 100% sure, to be honest. Our developers experimented with the built-in export functionality and came up with the problem that global CSS isn't used for PDF rendering...and they were unable to add header and footer to it.
09:08 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Didn't have time to investigate any further yet.
09:16 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, I would share the itext code with you but I have no idea where it is now. It was not very difficult to do though. I doubt that is the best approach for you though -- for me I was generating a pdf of a report which didn't realyl change. I would guess that Open Office integration is what you need.
10:44 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> jardineworks: The main issue about this whole PDF thing is the styling, not the generation itself. I'm still not entirely sure about it.
10:44 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> The default "This article as PDF" button just renders the article with it's template into a PDF.
10:45 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, sure... but I would guess you could use media queries to create a "pdf view"
10:45 < bijoo_:#liferay> nicolas_FR: hey, try removing all except this one: base.css, from the main.css file. Rebuild and redeploy, check if it's minified.
10:45 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> If this template uses CSS classes and doesn't contain style definitions, no styling is applied.
10:45 < bijoo_:#liferay> nicolas_FR: also, I replied to your post just now. Please post the log file to the same thread/post.
10:47 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> bijoo_: ok, will try that on the test server. should be back in 15min
11:00 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> bijoo_: ack did not see you wanted the fresh logs from server restart.. trying to get you that
11:12 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> bijoo_: I replied to your answer on the forum
11:13 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> bijoo_: looking at chrome developer tools, I have 2 sources for css : base.css and main.css. Both are not minified
11:19 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> gotta go, good week end all
12:26 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik, are you around this evening?
12:30 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, maybe you can help -- I'm trying to figure out if it is possible to use the federated search (portlet #3) but specify the structureIds that are valid for the search.
12:31 < jardineworks:#liferay> There is a facet configuration that lets you specify "JournalArticle" but i need to go deeper than that and specify the individual structures so that thins like "testimonials" don't surface in the results.
13:58 <@jhf:#liferay> jardineworks
13:59 <@jhf:#liferay> ya know that is probable possibly with a fancy facet definition or something. have you read through https://www.liferay.com/web/raymond.auge/blog/-/blogs/faceted-search-in-liferay-6-1
14:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, I have -- but I'm not sure I toally understand
14:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, so you're saying I need to add another facet to my search query, but that this facet will specify the structure ids?
14:07 <@jhf:#liferay> ok so first, I have never used any of this and just have barely an understanding of faceted search :)
14:07 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, I think we're at the same point then...
14:07 < jardineworks:#liferay> lol
14:07 <@jhf:#liferay> but from ray's post he show's an example of making a pre-configured search portlet to only return images
14:08 <@jhf:#liferay> using one facet only
14:08 < jardineworks:#liferay> Oct 16 2012 update?
14:08 <@jhf:#liferay> configured for getting results from doclib and FURTHER configuring a list of extensions so only imgs are returned
14:09 <@jhf:#liferay> so I wonder if the facet responsible for searching assets can somehow be "configured" to only show assets that are web content and have a specific structure ID
14:09 <@jhf:#liferay> oh yeah there is a com.liferay.portlet.journal.util.JournalIndexer
14:09 <@jhf:#liferay> wait ignore that
14:10 <@jhf:#liferay> I suppose you could implement a custom facet if the OOTB facets can't be configured appropriately to restrict to a specific structure ID
14:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> my fieldName would probably be structureId ...
14:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> the values[] you are saying would be my list of structure ids?
14:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> i see
14:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> so this --
14:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> {
14:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> 	"displayStyle": "asset_entries",
14:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> 	"static": true,
14:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> 	"weight": 1.5,
14:11 < jardineworks:#liferay>    	"order": "OrderHitsDesc",
14:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> 	"data": {
14:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> 		"values": [
14:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> 			"bmp", "gif", "jpeg", "jpg", "odg", "png", "svg"
14:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> 		],
14:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> 		"frequencyThreshold": 0
14:12 < jardineworks:#liferay>    	},
14:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> 	"className": "com.liferay.portal.kernel.search.facet.MultiValueFacet",
14:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> 	"label": "images",
14:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> 	"fieldName": "extension"
14:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> }
14:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> but with structureId, and "55325", "55321", etc
14:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> label: structures
14:14 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, lemme try this... that might do it for me.
14:14 <@jhf:#liferay> that's what i'd try
14:15 <@jhf:#liferay> in that image example from ray
14:15 <@jhf:#liferay> he has 2 facets
14:15 < jardineworks:#liferay> I'll report back in a few mins (need to restart)
14:15 < jardineworks:#liferay> server
14:15 <@jhf:#liferay> the first one see4ms to say "just give me DL entries"
14:15 <@jhf:#liferay> and the second says "give me images with extensions [x,y,z]"
14:15 <@jhf:#liferay> so instead you do the same, but with journal article and structureId
14:15 <@jhf:#liferay> you will need to know the name of the field that holds structure IDs in the returned search results for journalarticles
14:16 < jardineworks:#liferay> right -- I have a facet for the JournalArticles only already (entryClassName)... and my example above should provide an extension to the query to further filter by structure
14:16 <@jhf:#liferay> and use that name
14:16 <@jhf:#liferay> hopefully
14:17 <@jhf:#liferay> brb
14:29 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, I think maybe my configuration is not being picked up
14:29 < jardineworks:#liferay> if it were then I would see it in the query right?
14:29 < jardineworks:#liferay> right now I have this --
14:29 < jardineworks:#liferay> +(+(companyId:10154) +((+(entryClassName:com.liferay.portlet.journal.model.JournalArticle) +(status:0)))) +(assetCategoryTitles:*blueberries* assetCategoryTitles_en_US:*blueberries* assetTagNames:*blueberries* comments:blueberries content:blueberries description:blueberries properties:blueberries title:blueberries url:blueberries userName:*blueberries* classPK:blueberries content_en_US:blueberries description_en_US:blueberries entryClassP
14:29 < jardineworks:#liferay> K:blueberries title_en_US:blueberries type:blueberries) uid
14:29 < jardineworks:#liferay> but I would expect to see structureId
14:34 < jardineworks:#liferay> :O
14:34 < jardineworks:#liferay> I think I see it!
14:43 < jardineworks:#liferay> \o/
14:43 <@jhf:#liferay> works?
14:44 < jardineworks:#liferay> :)
14:44 < jardineworks:#liferay> it does!
14:44 < jardineworks:#liferay> now I just have to figure out how to get the pagination to work in my franken-search and i'll be done!
14:45 <@jhf:#liferay> \o/
14:45 <@jhf:#liferay> I think you should do a blog post entitled "Liferay FrankenSearch" at some point
14:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> totally
14:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> lol
14:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> what I have made here... I should not be proud of... BUT I AM!
14:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> :)
14:47 < jardineworks:#liferay> 1.5 days? federated franken-saerch? ... this could be a mastercard commercial
14:47 < jardineworks:#liferay> 3 search engines, 2 shitty services, 0 understanding, 3 facet configuration. working frankensearch results? priceless
15:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, I have another one for you. I want to use 3 reserved elements for the search results so that I know for sure, regardless of the structure type returned, those elements are available (evn if not filled in).
15:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, the three I want to use are title, description (which I think maps to summary on the abstract) and small image url (from the abstract)
15:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> in my frankensearch (JSP) I have the article object -- the full one.
15:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> hmm.. maybe I don;t need the fill one.
15:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> full*
15:05 <@jhf:#liferay> those fields I think are part of the Java API for the JournalArticle
15:05 <@jhf:#liferay> i.e. you don't need to parse xml to get their values
15:06 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, I was going to ask that... but then I must be looking at the wrong thing because I don't see getters for them
15:06 <@jhf:#liferay> http://docs.liferay.com/portal/6.1/javadocs/com/liferay/portlet/journal/model/JournalArticleModel.html
15:07 < jardineworks:#liferay> bust -- I was looking at JournalArticleImpl
15:07 <@jhf:#liferay> well you're not supposed to look under the kimono !
15:10 < modd:#liferay> is it possible, that there's some kind of extension property for drag&drop in the doclib? I can't drop doc/docx etc. but I can drop e.g. jpeg/pdf (lr 6.2)
15:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> haha
15:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> (that was for jhf... i wasn't laughing at your hardship modd)
15:13 <@jhf:#liferay> modd: checking
15:13 <@jhf:#liferay> I believe there is but doc/docx should be on the VIP list
15:13 < modd:#liferay> I know there's a property for doclib and I know these extensions are part of it
15:13 < modd:#liferay> that's why I'm confused
15:14 <@jhf:#liferay> ok I was able to drag/drop a .docx into the doclib
15:14 < modd:#liferay> hmm..
15:14 <@jhf:#liferay> what OS are you on?
15:14 < modd:#liferay> windows
15:14 <@jhf:#liferay> I knew it!
15:15 <@jhf:#liferay> hmm.. can you try a diff browser while I fire up windows 8?
15:15 < modd:#liferay> the files shows up in the list, but with a red "x" icon in front of it
15:15 <@jhf:#liferay> hmm
15:15 < modd:#liferay> tried chrome/firefox/IE
15:15 <@jhf:#liferay> how are you dropping them? I just made a new page, put the "Documents and Media" app on it, then dropped the file into it
15:15 < modd:#liferay> same steps here
15:16 < modd:#liferay> and it works..but not with all files^^
15:16 < modd:#liferay> btw: liferay sync doesn't work with the new doclib (not tested, heard it today)
15:17 <@jhf:#liferay> the desktop version(s) of sync do not yet work with 6.2
15:17 <@jhf:#liferay> the mobile version(s) do though
15:17 < modd:#liferay> I'm also about to test liferay ide 2.0 the next days
15:18 < modd:#liferay> another point: there's a new feature: a site can have sub sites now
15:18 < modd:#liferay> and you can share the content of the parent site to the child sites
15:18 < modd:#liferay> this sharing/inheritance doesn't work at all in our tests^^
15:19 <@jhf:#liferay> juan f did a blog post with an example of setting up child sites with sharing: https://www.liferay.com/web/juan.fernandez/blog/-/blogs/liferay-6-2-new-mobile-features-pt-2- can you walk though that and see if it really doesn't work?
15:19 <@jhf:#liferay> that would be a serious issue if so
15:24 < modd:#liferay> sorry, but not now. but I'll do it and give you response :)
15:28 <@jhf:#liferay> also mode do you have microsoft office installed on that system?
15:29 <@jhf:#liferay> I wonder if windows tries to do weird things when moving those kinds of files, perhaps when office is installed. dunno. in the process of extracting 6.2 now on a windows 8 vm
15:29 < modd:#liferay> btw, my problems with dynamic data lists and non-admin users after login are gone after switching from hsql to mysql. (please change hsql as a default or make the option 200times bigger, so one see it)
15:29 < modd:#liferay> nope, just libre office
15:42 <@jhf:#liferay> 6.2 finally starting up on windows 8
15:44 <@jhf:#liferay> amazingly it started with no errors
15:44 <@jhf:#liferay> trying drag/drop..
15:47 <@jhf:#liferay> hmm I get errors even with a PDF!
15:59 <@jhf:#liferay> well IE10 is not a friendly browser. kept opening thousands of windows each click
15:59 <@jhf:#liferay> downloaded chrome.. it resulted in an entirely black screen and crashed windows.
15:59 <@jhf:#liferay> hmm.
15:59 <@jhf:#liferay> trying ff
16:00 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I thought everybody agreed not to use Windows 8?
16:00 <@jhf:#liferay> what is modd using?
16:02 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Just a general statement.
16:02 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> We have like one box at the office running Windows 8 and nobody really wants to use it.
16:02 <@jhf:#liferay> well I freaking hate it, but I rarely use it
16:03 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Windows 7 is the first Microsoft OS since 3.1 that I actually enjoy using.
16:03 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I'll try to stick with it as long as possiblr.
16:03 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> *possible
16:04 <@jhf:#liferay> all I have is windows 8, windows vista, and windows 2003 server R2 :)
16:04 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I used to have only Linux on my own boxes...but I pretty much use them only for gaming and some internet stuff by now.
16:04 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Work stays at the office.
16:05 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> So Linux wasn't really a sane choice any more.
16:05 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> At the office I'm on OS X now, which is also very enjoyable.
16:06 <@jhf:#liferay> yep I get the same thing modd
16:16 <@jhf:#liferay> modd: I filed https://issues.liferay.com/browse/LPS-43597
16:16 <@jhf:#liferay> please add yourself as a watcher if interested
16:23 < pnutbutr:#liferay> is it possible to forward to another url from a portlet response?
16:23 < pnutbutr:#liferay> not a redirect that's visible to the browser
16:24 < pnutbutr:#liferay> but say a request comes in for /some/url, have a portlet respond by forwarding to a different url internal to the server?
16:24 < pnutbutr:#liferay> transparent to the browser?
16:28 < pnutbutr:#liferay> think I found the answer.  that won't work at the portlet level.
16:29 < pnutbutr:#liferay> you can only affect the PortletResponse by forwarding using the PortletRequestDispatcher.
16:29 < pnutbutr:#liferay> won't work on the page level
