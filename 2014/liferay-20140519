01:36 < rocknroll_> hey all. I made a mistake early on and made my pages public. Now I need to make them so that they all need signing in
01:37 < rocknroll_> It seems pretty difficult
01:39 < rocknroll_> and the permissions are a mess..
01:50 < modd_> go to the sites config
01:50 < modd_> click on one of the pages
01:50 < modd_> click on permissions
01:50 < modd_> and take away guest permissions
01:51 < modd_> do it for all pages that need signing
01:55 < rocknroll_> did that, thanks. Also added a login-page with sign  in portlet
01:55 < rocknroll_> so if user arrives at my site, he gets redirected to the login page, which is visible to guest
01:56 < rocknroll_> and after sign in, he gets redirected to either where he was originally going, or front pgae
01:56 < rocknroll_> yes, seems to work now :)
01:58 < rocknroll_> For future reference, is there a way to do this "in bulk"? This was pretty hard work for 100+ pages :P
02:01 < modd_> well, you can do it directly on the database, but doing things on the db is some kind of risky. ;)
02:04 < rocknroll_> I've noticed _>
03:19 < twen> hello
03:49 < modd_> hi
03:53 < modd_> hey topolik, seems like the sdk build scripts for 6.2.1 are broken
04:27 < topolik> hi modd_
04:27 < topolik> ok
04:27 < topolik> how can I test it?
04:53 < modd_> topolik: I simply tried to create an ext plugin
04:54 < modd_> with sdk of 6.2 ga1 it works perfectly
04:55 < modd_> with the latest sdk nothing happens. after I've deleted some of the URLs, it resolves some of the dependencies but in the end it stops and says, that it "can't resolve the dependency"
05:01 < topolik> ah, ok
05:01 < topolik> thanks I try it
07:01 < modd_> topolik: can you reproduce it?
07:20 < topolik> modd_: I'm sorry, I cannot
07:20 < modd_> hmm
07:21 < modd_> liferay-plugins-sdk-6.2-ce-ga2-20140319114139101 - this is what I have here
07:22 < topolik> yup, the same
07:22 < topolik> now it uses Ivy to resolve the references
07:22 < modd_> yep
07:22 < topolik> can this be the problem?
07:22 < modd_> I'll try it again and post the output
07:23 < topolik> ok
07:24 < modd_> ok, nevermind. works now. maybe one of the urls was offline as I tried first. weird
07:32 < topolik> ok :)
