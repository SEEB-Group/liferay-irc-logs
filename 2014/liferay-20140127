04:59 < wench_:#liferay> how to install 7 cogs on liferay 6.2
05:00 < wench_:#liferay> ??
11:18 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey topolik are you around for a quick question?
11:18 < jardineworks:#liferay> more of a feature availability than an actual problem to solve.
11:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik, The auditing feature of LR. Looking at the comparison matrix between EE and CE it seems to suggest that it is not available in CE. But I can see the filter flag in the portal-ext and I can see the Audit* objects in the portal source. So is the thing that is not available basically the nice portlet that allows you to review the audit records?
12:22 < centr0:#liferay> After deleting a theme, Liferay is still trying to reference this theme pushing warnings in catalina. WARN  [http-bio-8080-exec-95][ThemeLocalServiceImpl:149] No theme found for specified theme id summer_WAR_summertheme. Not allowing us to change the theme to a new one.  Any ideas on how to fix?
12:34 < jardineworks:#liferay> centr0, only way I have solved that one is to remove the references from the Layout table.
12:34 < jardineworks:#liferay> basically, go run an update setting the theme to blank ("") where the name is <bad theme id here>
12:52 < centr0:#liferay> jardineworks: Thanks! I'll look into it.
13:46 < wench_:#liferay> hi, i need to to boost the performance of liferay on tomcat
13:46 < wench_:#liferay> so what is the recommended config for that?
13:46 < wench_:#liferay> will increasing memory be enough?
14:13 < jardineworks:#liferay> wench_, There are several defacto things you can do ... let me see if I can find the link for you
14:14 < jardineworks:#liferay> wench_, there are dozens of people all posting essentially the same thing. Here is an example of some things you can do --
14:14 < jardineworks:#liferay> http://usefulliferaytips.blogspot.ca/2012/11/performance-tuning.html
14:15 < jardineworks:#liferay> but outside of this you need to identify the bottlenecks. Memory may help, .. how much memory have you assigned to the JVM?
14:22 < wench_:#liferay> 1536
14:23 < wench_:#liferay> thx jardineworks, i modified catalina.sh
14:23 < jardineworks:#liferay> wench_, best practice is to do that stuff in a setenv.sh
14:23 < wench_:#liferay> and i modified the jvmoptions only if the commadn is startup
14:23 < jardineworks:#liferay> startup/catalina look for it by default.
14:24 < jardineworks:#liferay> then you don't have to do that check you just referenced.
14:24 < wench_:#liferay> mmm, ok i'll move it
16:10 < wench_:#liferay> hello, I need ur help guys. I have a fresh installation of Liferay 6.2 on tomcat, and I increase mem to 2 G. on these config i still have bad performance
16:10 < wench_:#liferay> switching between dash & profile takes around 7 to 15 sec
16:11 < wench_:#liferay> opening other pages takes 5 to 9 sec
16:12 < wench_:#liferay> don't know where is the problem? appreciate ur help
16:50 < wench_:#liferay> found a good book convering the best practices for liferay performance
16:50 < wench_:#liferay> http://www.packtpub.com/liferay-portal-performance-best-practices/book
16:51 < wench_:#liferay> hope it helps who may need it.

17:52 < centr0:#liferay> still having a warning message on catalina after removing themeIds from the db: WARN  [http-bio-8080-exec-1][ThemeLocalServiceImpl:149] No theme found for specified theme id . Returning the default theme. Any other ideas? :)
21:42 < charith:#liferay> hello
21:43 < charith:#liferay> liferay 5.2.3 is not working with java 1.7
21:43 < charith:#liferay> it gives me No ClassLoaders found for: com.sun.image.codec.jpeg.ImageFormatException
21:43 < charith:#liferay> any easy workaround?
22:33 < jardineworks:#liferay> charith, that is not a 5.2.3 issue... that is a java 1.7 issue
22:34 < jardineworks:#liferay> easiest work around is to use 1.6
22:34 < jardineworks:#liferay> or use a very early update version of 1.7
22:34 < jardineworks:#liferay> I think pre u14
22:36 < charith:#liferay> jardineworks: thanks, actually issue was I hv not set up JDK
22:36 < charith:#liferay> i only had jre
22:36 < charith:#liferay> not it is ok
22:36 < charith:#liferay> but still i m getting an array out of bound exception
22:37 < jardineworks:#liferay> can you pastebin the full stacktrace?
22:37 < charith:#liferay> sure
22:39 < charith:#liferay> jardineworks: http://apaste.info/31Nt
22:40 < jardineworks:#liferay> charith, I don't actually have the 5.2.3 source on this machine. What is happening around line 273?
22:41 < jardineworks:#liferay> in my 6.1.2 source its processing the css
22:42 < charith:#liferay> jardineworks: http://grepcode.com/file/repo1.maven.org/maven2/com.liferay.portal/portal-impl/5.2.3/com/liferay/portal/servlet/filters/strip/StripFilter.java/
22:45 < jardineworks:#liferay> can you enable debug for the strip filter and see what url it is stripping?
22:45 < jardineworks:#liferay> (before the error occurs I mean)
22:45 < charith:#liferay> ok, what point should i consider in it
22:49 < jardineworks:#liferay> if you go to the admin you can set the logging level for the StripFilter (I think) to ALL. Save and rerun your test and if should log some debug level info for that class
