01:15 < Axxell:#liferay> hey guys, im having problems with liferay 6.1 and vaadin 6.7.4.. apparently IE11 doesnt like vaadin ajax loading itself
06:14 < ferrema:#liferay> good morning
06:14 < ferrema:#liferay> i am trying to integrate solr into liferay 6.1
06:15 < ferrema:#liferay> i *think* the liferay plugin for solr (forked from git, version 6.1.3) is linked with an out dated solr
06:16 < ferrema:#liferay> as far as I can understand latest stable solr is 4.6.1
06:17 < ferrema:#liferay> looking at the solr-web plugin I can see that the solr libs refer to solr 1.4.1
06:17 < ferrema:#liferay> this leads to errors when trying to index : Invalid version or the data in not in 'javabin' format
06:18 < ferrema:#liferay> which is likely due to the fact that solr-core and solr-solrj that the plugin refers to are the wrong version
06:19 < ferrema:#liferay> trying to merely update the jars leads to compilation problems (eg): ERROR in /home/ferrema/devel/liferay6.1/workspace/liferay-plugins/webs/solr-web/docroot/WEB-INF/src/com/liferay/portal/search/solr/server/SolrServerFactoryImpl.java (at line 22)
06:19 < ferrema:#liferay>     [javac] 	import org.apache.solr.client.solrj.SolrServer;
06:19 < ferrema:#liferay> so the question is :
06:19 < ferrema:#liferay> is there any chance to get an updated solr-web plugin ?
06:20 < ferrema:#liferay> alternatively : which version of apache-solr server is needed for liferay 6.1.3 ?
06:38 < ferrema:#liferay> looks like solr 1.4 server is working with the plugin
07:07 < Axxell:#liferay> anyone know about vaadin trouble with ie11?
09:22 -!- mode/#liferay [+o rotty3000] by ChanServ
11:02 < ferrema:#liferay> didn't test ie11 yet
11:02 < ferrema:#liferay> @ least none of my users reported probs
14:11 < Redxross:#liferay> Hey guys.  I am just beginning my journey with Liferay but wanted to get an important question answered and was hoping someone might know: I have a bunch of play app's... is it possible to convert each of my apps to a portlet?
14:16 < Redxross:#liferay> anyone every try doing something like that? using play app's as a port let?
14:41 < Redxross:#liferay> anyone home?
14:41 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Yes, but I can't really help you.
14:42 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Haven't done much with play.
14:42 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I would assume that you will have to wrap your applications in the necessary portlet code.
14:51 < Redxross:#liferay> would love to see an example of that.. doesn't have to be play.. just liferay portlet being used to wrap something running in another container
15:51 <@jhf:#liferay> jardineworks:
16:35 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf!
16:35 < jardineworks:#liferay> whats up?
16:37 <@jhf:#liferay> just wanted to let you know I went crazy and made a "dump everything that's available" freemarker script to dump all variables and values in web content templates, themes, etc.
16:37 <@jhf:#liferay> see the bottom of https://www.liferay.com/community/forums/-/message_boards/message/33824647 to see a screenshot and get a pointer to the script
16:37 <@jhf:#liferay> here's the script: https://gist.github.com/jamesfalkner/8832377
16:38 <@jhf:#liferay> didn't try it on 6.1 yet, just 6.2, but gonna try 6.1 now
16:39 <@jhf:#liferay> works on 6.1 too, yay
16:39 <@jhf:#liferay> not as pretty though
16:39 < jardineworks:#liferay> cool!
16:39 < jardineworks:#liferay> wait... 6.1.2?
16:40 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah
16:40 < jardineworks:#liferay> so you have a request object in your version?
16:40 <@jhf:#liferay> yep, it's (almost) always there.
16:40 <@jhf:#liferay> remember there's that one bug that makes it not show up when viewing it in asset publisher, unless "full content" view mode is selected.
16:40 < jardineworks:#liferay> do you know what causes it to not be there the unalmost times?
16:42 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah it's due to https://issues.liferay.com/browse/LPS-25280 I think
16:42 <@jhf:#liferay> the fix is https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/commit/c61df320a57fa4eecbdb148095131171b173523d#diff-0
16:42 <@jhf:#liferay> but only fixed in 6.2+
16:43 <@jhf:#liferay> also have to fix this jsp for 'full content' view mode: https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/commit/5279b6afd747feb9b9ea71cb42b96e75537ba288#diff-1
16:45 < jardineworks:#liferay> hah -- that is a different line change from the last one we tried last week
16:45 < jardineworks:#liferay> I'll have to give that a shot later.
