09:19 < ra2:#liferay> i'm using liferay 6.2 and would like to add required to select component
09:19 < ra2:#liferay> is there one way to do it ?
09:25 < jardineworks:#liferay> ra2, javascript?
09:25 < jardineworks:#liferay> or you could do it server side I suppose and simply reload the page with a message if it is missing
09:27 < ra2:#liferay> jardineworks: on jsp.
09:28 < ra2:#liferay> jardineworks: i found the solution. it's only set  attribute required="true" on aui:select
09:53 < jardineworks:#liferay> ra2, ah -- aui select. I thought you were using a regular <select> :)
09:53 < ra2:#liferay> jardineworks: :)
