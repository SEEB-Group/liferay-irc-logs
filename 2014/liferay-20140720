09:52 < dvayanu:#liferay> hello, and well, nice weekend and stuff, but maybe someone is online despite the weekend. I have following problem, basically I am trying to force liferay to work with own user service impl, and it doesn't really work ;-) I made my own user service hook, i return true in authentic by xxx method, and than i get an error in render_portal.jsp... in a line that doesn't exists
10:09 < dvayanu:#liferay> is there any example anywhere on how to implement own user service with liferay
