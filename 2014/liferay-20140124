05:23 < Axxell:#liferay> hey guys a more or less stupid question again: Liferay.PortletURL.createRenderURL only creates the URI not the URL it seems.. how do i create the full url?
06:28 < Axxell:#liferay> sry got my terms wrong i cant get the URL just the URN
11:08 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, I need the velocity master when he has a minute
11:09 <@jhf:#liferay> ok, go for it
11:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, do you know if there was a problem with one of the the $request object in journal templates in 6.1.2?
11:09 <@jhf:#liferay> there are bugs, yes, but not sure what you're referring to :)
11:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> this is not working for me -- #set ($layoutId = $request.get("theme-display").get("plid"))
11:09 <@jhf:#liferay> the request object is really just a hashmap
11:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> I think my request object is showing {}
11:10 <@jhf:#liferay> btw, you can just say $request.theme-display.plid
11:10 <@jhf:#liferay> (assuming plid is right - i'll check if it works for me)
11:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> request for me is returning {} in the journal templates
11:11 <@jhf:#liferay> hmm.. can you un-check the "cacheable' option?
11:13 <@jhf:#liferay> works for me with 6.1.2
11:18 < jardineworks:#liferay> just unchecked it... but I guess I have to clear some caches too now?
11:18 <@jhf:#liferay> shouldn't have to.. are you doing anything weird, like trying to embed a web content article in something else?
11:23 <@jhf:#liferay> and does it happen for all templates, or just that one?
11:32 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, sorry... had to help unload a new staircase.
11:32 < jardineworks:#liferay> nope nothing odd... lemme try one more time
11:32 <@jhf:#liferay> you can try clearing all caches too
11:32 <@jhf:#liferay> perhaps something is gummed up deep down in the gears
11:37 < jardineworks:#liferay> negative
11:37 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, still showing {} ... i'm just outputting $request
11:37 < jardineworks:#liferay> I thought I saw a JIRA issue around this for 6.1 but maybe I am thinking of soemthing else.
11:42 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf,  here it is... it was a while ago though https://support.liferay.com/browse/LPS-32074
11:43 <@jhf:#liferay> hmmm
11:43 <@jhf:#liferay> so you're showing it an an asset publisher eh.. lemme try that real quick.
11:43 < jardineworks:#liferay> oh no
11:43 < jardineworks:#liferay> sorry
11:44 < jardineworks:#liferay> I just have a custom portlet that uses the API to retrieve JournalArticleDisplay objects ... it makes a list and then I dump it on the page
11:44 <@jhf:#liferay> well that bug does exist in 6.1.2 (I added my test article to an asset publisher, and indeed $request is {} )
11:45 < jardineworks:#liferay> but is that a bug specific to the asset publisher? or would it be applicable to anything that uses the journal article display objects?
11:47 <@jhf:#liferay> hmm that I do not know. not sure if AP uses that particular API or not, or if it is different than how it is used when the article is displayed in a Web Content Display portlet
11:47 <@jhf:#liferay> ok now here's something interesting
11:47 <@jhf:#liferay> I re-configured asset publisher to show "full content" and it works (previously it was configured to show "Abstracts" only, the default)
11:48 <@jhf:#liferay> so I bet there's some API to say "give me the full deal"
11:48 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf,  you lost me. Aren't I depending on LR to push that request map into the journal template scope for me?
11:49 <@jhf:#liferay> yes, but it might not do it by default in the API you are using. which APIs are you using?
11:50 < jardineworks:#liferay> JournalArticle, JournalArticleLocalServiceUtil, JournalArticleDisplay....
11:50 <@jhf:#liferay> and how are you calling JournalArticleLocalServiceUtil.get???
11:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> lemme pastebin
11:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> uno minuto
11:52 < jardineworks:#liferay> this one gets the latest articles of a certain structure type -- http://pastebin.com/1Lu7g8Rd
11:52 < jardineworks:#liferay> (remember I'm not allowed to use asset publisher)
11:53 < jardineworks:#liferay> this one applies the template to the JournalArticle so I get just the raw HTML to output.
11:53 < jardineworks:#liferay> http://pastebin.com/McRmtHDN
11:53 < jardineworks:#liferay> then in my jsp I have a <c:forEach/> that just prints the strings.
22:29 < jer_:#liferay> hi, everyone! i'm seeking advice on setting up a facade for a redmine server. it seems silly to ask our users to use liferay for some stuff but then switch to redmine for the good stuff it serves up. isn't there an easy way to have liferay proxy redmine?
22:41 < jer_:#liferay> ^some^most
22:44 < jer_:#liferay> silly me... friday night, of course nobody's here. have fun, everyone! ttyl.
