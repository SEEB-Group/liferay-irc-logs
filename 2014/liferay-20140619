08:57 < twen:#liferay> Hello
08:58 < twen:#liferay> Doesn't some know if tere some kind of ticketing systeme for Lifery. One of our departement wants to let people to raise questions and they answer on liferay.
08:58 < twen:#liferay> (I try to stay alart today ;) )
09:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> twen, you mean portlets, hooks etc that allows you to setup a jira type system on top of Liferay?
09:15 < twen:#liferay> jardineworks You can think of a very simplified Jira tickting system, with 2 or 3 fields... and yes available from withing Liferay. would be good to be managed inside liferay if possible, instead of an external service
09:15 < twen:#liferay> (this is because our company don't want to rely on services on the net....)
