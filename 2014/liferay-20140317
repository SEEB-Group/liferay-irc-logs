04:45 < mtsr> Is there a hook for User Signup so that I can for example send a notification when a user signs up? I cannot find it in the documentation.
04:48 < huffg> :Z
06:06 < Alex_____> Hello! Quick question: How do I set the permissions in a folder so that users only see their own documents in there?
06:27 < Alex_____> ...anyone ?!!!
06:35 < huffg> who knows tinker with the ui
08:17 < Alex_____> How do I set the permissions in a folder so that users only see their own documents in there?
09:04 < CGdM> Hi, good morning!
09:06 < CGdM> is there anyone who can help me with staging in liferay?
09:19 < huffg> yesyse
09:19 < huffg> don't do remote staging and you are all set hehe
09:19 < huffg> Alex_____: you can just fiddle around with the permissions ui
09:20 < huffg> that sounds like a curious permission anyhow
09:22 < CGdM> my problem is the following
09:22 < CGdM> Have you ever configured staging on a site that already exists?
09:22 < CGdM> there are problems?
09:23 < huffg> no i haven't
09:23 < huffg> it can be np
09:23 < Alex_____> huffg: Oh I have fiddled alright!!! I get all or nothing! I think the right way to do it is by making a new document type with default permissions. Any thoughts on that?
09:23 < huffg> yes perhaps
09:24 < huffg> CGdM: just get your sandbox/test env going and try it
09:24 < huffg> do not do it in prod
09:25 < CGdM> yes :) this is a goood idea :)
09:25 < huffg> it should be ok
09:25 < CGdM> with an existing site, how long can the activation of the staging?
09:25 < huffg> it could take time
09:25 < huffg> the publishing system sucks
09:25 < huffg> you may have trouble with it
09:26 < huffg> even if staging works
09:27 < huffg> it sucks a lot
09:27 < CGdM> There is a log file where I can monitor the activation of the staging?
09:27 < huffg> who knows probably not
09:27 < huffg> CGdM: how long has it been running?
09:27 < huffg> are you on linux/unix?
09:27 < CGdM> linux
09:28 < huffg> CGdM: monitor your /tmp to see if something happens, i have a feeling it writes shit there
09:28 < huffg> df -h /tmp or -hs can't remeber
09:29 < huffg> CGdM: what version?
09:29 < huffg> and remote/live staging?
09:29 < CGdM> liferay 6.1.0 - local staging
09:30 < huffg> ok
09:30 < huffg> CGdM: publishing can take a lot of time after you activate staging
09:30 < CGdM> Ok... now try in my test env....
09:31 < CGdM> after that, pass in PRODUCTION
09:31 < huffg> you should do extensive testing
09:31 < huffg> publishing is such a pain in the ass
09:32 < huffg> CGdM: i'm fairly sure the staging activation will work but publishing may be zz pzz depending on your site and on the position of stars
09:33 < Alex_____> huffg: Is there a way to set a document type to be publish-able by two roles but viewable only by one?!! What I am trying to do is have the members of the board submit their proposals but not be able to see the other members' proposal - only their own. (sorry about the bad English)
09:34 < huffg> mm no idea
09:35 < huffg> Alex_____: the idea of default permission for document type sounds like a plan
09:37 < Alex_____> hugg: I does but I cant implement it! I cant get it to display all roles under "Viewable by"
09:37 < Alex_____> I only get Guest and Owner
09:41 < huffg> :Z
09:41 < huffg> isn't owner enough?
09:44 < Alex_____> it is not because then no one will see the document and I need it them be visible by the board secretary! (I just dont want the board members to see who is ratting who!)
09:45 < huffg> hehe
09:48 < Alex_____> there must be a way! I cant be the only one who ever needed this scenario... I just cant get how to display the other roles in there
10:32 < mtsr> Is there a way to link back to the workflow in a kaleo notification?
10:33 < Alex_____> mtsr: have you managed to make a workflow that only notifies? I would be interested in this! (sorry, I cant help with your question)
10:35 < mtsr> Ehr no, so far my workflow is not much different from the single-approver one. Although I did try removing the extra state, but all that did was break it :P
10:35 < mtsr> If you figure that out let me know too :)
10:36 < Alex_____> hehe! I did manage to break it too!
10:39 < mtsr> maaaaan, documentation sucks
10:42 < mtsr> wow, so from the code, by default it seems kaleo exposes only taskComments to the template
11:00 < Alex_____> does anyone know how to delete the only private page? I get the "You must have at least one page." error
