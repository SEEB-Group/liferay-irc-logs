09:23 < hufg-:#liferay> hello hello whats up?
09:34 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey hufg happy new year!
09:41 < hufg-:#liferay> thanks man happy new yéar to you too \o/
10:07 < webczat:#liferay> Hello.
10:08 < webczat:#liferay> I'm a blind user and have the following question: is it at all possible for me to lay out webpages without using the mouse?
10:24 <@jhf:#liferay> webczat: yes, it is possible without using the mouse, but it is highly dependent on your browser and its interaction with your operating system (w/r/t keyboard shortcuts)
10:24 < webczat:#liferay> how to do this?
10:25 <@jhf:#liferay> since Liferay's user interface is 99% through the browser, all of its interfaces are standard components (for example, you can press the tab button to cycle through input fields, etC)
10:25 <@jhf:#liferay> you interact with Liferay in the same way you interact with any other web site
10:26 < webczat:#liferay> hmm i actually meant things like
10:26 < webczat:#liferay> I'm adding a portlet and cannot change it's position w/o the mouse
10:26 <@jhf:#liferay> ahh I see..
10:27 <@jhf:#liferay> which browser and operating system do you use?
10:27 <@jhf:#liferay> there may be a browser and/or OS plugin that lets you mimic the mouse inputs using keyboard only.
10:28 < webczat:#liferay> hmm windows 7/nvda screenreader/ee firefox
10:29 <@jhf:#liferay> I'm not sure if you can read/see this, but here's a good overview of Liferay's accessibility: http://www.slideshare.net/juliocamarero/accessibility-16441704
10:29 <@jhf:#liferay> I will also encourage you to write a forum post at liferay.com/community/forums and I can also put you in contact with one of our accessibility experts (the guy that wrote that slideshare presentation)
10:30 <@jhf:#liferay> Julio would know for sure the best way to do what you ask. in the meantime lemme look around a bit and see if there's a tool you can use.
10:31 <@jhf:#liferay> have you tried Windows 7's "MouseKeys" ? http://www.bbc.co.uk/accessibility/guides/keyboard_mouse/computer/win/win7/index.shtml
10:32 < webczat:#liferay> haha just not sure how could I know what column I'm adding the portlet to, although mouse keys could work, not sure
10:33 <@jhf:#liferay> without having tried it myself, I do not know, but I know Liferay developers go to great lengths to ensure we use the proper metadata when constructing the portal, so for example the CSS used for classifying columns is most likely using an ARIA tag, so it may announce the columns as you "move" a portlet around
10:34 <@jhf:#liferay> Julio would be a really great resource for you to contact. if you send me an email james.falkner@liferay.com and I can put you in contact.
10:35 <@jhf:#liferay> FYI for the 6.2 release we had a few blind users help us test out Liferay's accessibility
10:36 < webczat:#liferay> mhm, actually columns are not announced unless nvda is a stupid piece of crap. I also have other accessibility problems, I have netbook and when the browser is not maximized, I need to expand things in the dock to see anything like sign in. no problem. but i'm unable to expand anything when it comes to for example page administration, like trying to expand this thing that shows the add child...
10:36 < webczat:#liferay> ...page/export/etc buttons. when the browser is maximized there is no problem here.
10:37 <@jhf:#liferay> are you using 6.2?
10:37 < webczat:#liferay> then there is the problem with adding portlets using the add button instead of dragging. :)
10:38 < webczat:#liferay> yes.
10:38 < webczat:#liferay> and have ldap + other issues but I have workarounds for most
10:39 < webczat:#liferay> and I didn't see any need for workarounds for non-administrative content for now.
10:39 < webczat:#liferay> my email is webczat_200@poczta.onet.pl
10:40 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah.. it is possible to build a non-accessible site with Liferay :) but if our administrative UIs are not accessible, that is a problem
10:40 < webczat:#liferay> hmm they are not so bad.
10:41 < webczat:#liferay> i only needed to maximize the browser and disable showing account settings in popup. the second one presented a problem when trying to edit a personal site
10:42 < webczat:#liferay> because it behaved like the same showed without popup and with a window normal
10:43 <@jhf:#liferay> well good to know there is a workaround :)
10:43 <@jhf:#liferay> could you file a bug at issues.liferay.com by chance? the more bug reports (esp. accessibility ones) that we get, the better we can make it
10:43 <@jhf:#liferay> in the meantime I will put you in contact with Julio who should know the best way to drag portlets around w/out a mouse
10:44 < webczat:#liferay> unless there is no way. I would say it's understandable for me, but I don't want to search for help :D
10:45 <@jhf:#liferay> no worries, glad I can help (maybE)
10:45 < webczat:#liferay> the page you pointed me to clearly states that liferay is around 70% accessible in administrative pages and 80 in content creation. this may be one of those things
10:48 <@jhf:#liferay> ok webczat email sent
10:50 < webczat:#liferay> ack
10:51 < webczat:#liferay> btw, can you access server administration pages in 6.2? i can't. :D
10:52 <@jhf:#liferay> hmm.. what happens if you go to Control Panel -> Server Administration?
10:52 < webczat:#liferay> like the initial resources page shows up. clicking execute on anything or selecting another tab (inccluding the same resources tab) makes very strange things. the bottom of the page gets invisible, the last thing I see is the configuration menu and logs say something about invalid paths
10:52 <@jhf:#liferay> dang looks like Julio is on holiday till next Monday
10:53 <@jhf:#liferay> hmm.. have not seen that. lemme search bug database (you can also search this at issues.liferay.com)
10:53 < webczat:#liferay> you will find something. I've reported it yesterday haha
10:53 < webczat:#liferay> but wanted to ask if it's not my stupidity
10:53 <@jhf:#liferay> hahaha
10:53 <@jhf:#liferay> which LPS # is it?
10:54 < webczat:#liferay> ahh I don't remember :D
10:54 < webczat:#liferay> lemme check. btw, jira also has accessibility problems. but after some fighting with it I managed to report the bug :D
10:55 <@jhf:#liferay> brb
10:59 < webczat:#liferay> LPS-43190
10:59 < webczat:#liferay> reported a second one by accident too but it is the same
12:25 < webczat:#liferay> :)
12:42 < webczat:#liferay> anyone here?
12:43 < apucay:#liferay> we're all here
12:43 <@jhf:#liferay> post-holiday laziness for me
12:45 < webczat:#liferay> :D I have a question regarding permissions
12:45 < webczat:#liferay> because I like to understand what I'm really doing
12:46 < webczat:#liferay> what would happen if power user didn't have those permissions assignments like media add document etc? isn't it handled on the media portlet permission level?
12:50 < apucay:#liferay> well the defaults perms you can find in resource-actions\documentlibrary.xml
12:50 < apucay:#liferay> portal-impl\src\resource-actions\documentlibrary.xml
12:51 < webczat:#liferay> is iit the same for personal sites?
12:52 < apucay:#liferay> well the only member of a personal site is the person
12:52 < apucay:#liferay> looks like there are defaults for site members
12:53 < webczat:#liferay> hmm if a site member has the permission to do something, it applies to the whole site right? isn't it usually handled like on the object level like the created object assigns permissions to members instead?
12:55 < webczat:#liferay> erm okay, another question: what is the role called owner?
12:56 < apucay:#liferay> i think its for the user who created the entity
12:56 <@jhf:#liferay> webczat: https://www.liferay.com/documentation/liferay-portal/6.2/user-guide/-/ai/roles-and-permissions-liferay-portal-6-2-user-guide-16-en
12:57 <@jhf:#liferay> there is no role called "owner" - there is a "Site owner" role though, and that is by default assigned to the person who created the site (but can be re-assigned as needed, or multiple people can be assigned to the "site owner" role)
12:57 <@jhf:#liferay> note: that particular role is scoped to "site", so when you assign it to someone you have to choose a site AND a person to assign.
12:58 <@jhf:#liferay> ("scoping" of roles and permissions is discussed in that doc link above)
12:58 <@jhf:#liferay> (and is an important thing to understand and also answers your previous question)
13:00 < webczat:#liferay> actually there is a role called owner
13:00 < webczat:#liferay> although not described in the docs, it exists
13:00 < webczat:#liferay> and the description says that it gives permissions to hmm object creators probably
13:09 < webczat:#liferay> I'll research that. the last questions: if guests can not have pages, why they have permissions like add to page for most apps?
13:12 < apucay:#liferay> when you say guest, do you mean unauthenticated user, or an authenticated user who is not a member of a site?
13:14 < webczat:#liferay> the first
13:16 < apucay:#liferay> you experience being able to add porlets to a page, out of the box, as an unauthenticated user?
13:20 < webczat:#liferay> no
13:20 < webczat:#liferay> but I see the permission summary as an admin
13:22 < apucay:#liferay> and Guest is checked for ADD_TO_PAGE?
13:22 < apucay:#liferay> or what is that even available, you're saying?
13:33 < webczat:#liferay> i just see it on the list. i didn't say that guest magically got the permissions :)
13:33 < webczat:#liferay> like i didn't say he can use it
13:34 < webczat:#liferay> also btw from the perspective of a blind computer user, how are portlets lait out by default when I just add them using the add button instead of dragging?
13:41 < webczat:#liferay> like I'm blind and want to know what I'm doing
13:48 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey jhf  -- would you happen to have a link to a really good post on how to configure friendly urls?
13:48 < jardineworks:#liferay> one that shows public render parameters and all
13:49 <@jhf:#liferay> nope, at least, I don't have any "go-to" post that explains fUrls ..
13:49 <@jhf:#liferay> I'd just resort to google for that :(
13:49 <@jhf:#liferay> sorry, mon ami
13:50 < jardineworks:#liferay> ok -- I have a few bookmarked to work with. Thanks all the same. And happy new year :)
13:50 <@jhf:#liferay> yup, same to you (and everyone else)
13:51 <@jhf:#liferay> latvian adoption of the euro, solar eclipse in april, winter olympics and world cup.
13:51 <@jhf:#liferay> and my birthday.
13:51 <@jhf:#liferay> all these things in 2014.
13:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> big year!
13:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> hahah my birthday... when is it?
13:52 <@jhf:#liferay> august 15
13:53 < jardineworks:#liferay> bah -- that's miles away!
13:53 < jardineworks:#liferay> i'll never remember
13:53 <@jhf:#liferay> hahahah
13:53 < jardineworks:#liferay> I'll just say happy be-lated now
13:53 <@jhf:#liferay> I was gonna make a france joke there
13:54 <@jhf:#liferay> thanks. I need a big screen tv and one of those water jetpack things
13:54 < jardineworks:#liferay> je me souviens
13:54 < jardineworks:#liferay> that's what is says on the Quebec license plates
13:54 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah!!
13:54 <@jhf:#liferay> isn't it some french thing.. 'we remember' or something.. I can't remember :-)
13:54 < jardineworks:#liferay> it's one of the jokes in canada. "I remember". You remember what? when the british handed you your asses?
13:54 <@jhf:#liferay> hahahaha
13:55 <@jhf:#liferay> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Je_me_souviens
13:55 <@jhf:#liferay> I thought it was a french thing.. it's canadian!!
13:55 <@jhf:#liferay> luckily rotty3000 isn't here to scold me on my lack of north american knowledge
13:56 <@jhf:#liferay> I however do know more about the war of 1812 thanks to rotty3000
13:56 < jardineworks:#liferay> lol
13:57 < jardineworks:#liferay> we Canadians love to claim that victory... even though technically it was a british victory :)
13:58 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah.. and nothing actually resulted from said victory :)
13:58 <@jhf:#liferay> as far as land boundaries
13:58 <@jhf:#liferay> but "The outcome resolved many issues which remained from the American War of Independence"
13:59 <@jhf:#liferay> so I guess that was good.
13:59 < jardineworks:#liferay> well, we still send money to the queen every year :)
13:59 < jardineworks:#liferay> \o/ for us
13:59 <@jhf:#liferay> heh
13:59 <@jhf:#liferay> someone's gotta pay for those fancy weddings
14:02 < webczat:#liferay> ?
14:02 < jardineworks:#liferay> were were talking about our Mayor Ford fiasco the other day and something occurred to me. The left hate him and want him out. So they took away all his powers and made him mayor in name only. Mayor = figure head for the city right? but he is now the figure head with no power... so basically.... you made him king.
14:02 < jardineworks:#liferay> good job guys :)
14:02 < jardineworks:#liferay> you sure showed him
14:02 <@jhf:#liferay> lol
14:02 <@jhf:#liferay> he launched his re-election campaign recently.
14:02 <@jhf:#liferay> should be interesting..
14:03 < jardineworks:#liferay> He should wear a crown
14:03 < jardineworks:#liferay> and start smoking tobacco in a crack pipe :)
14:03 <@jhf:#liferay> heh
14:04 <@jhf:#liferay> sorry webczat we are WAY off topic
14:04 < webczat:#liferay> I know. I just asked a question befoore :)
14:08 < webczat:#liferay> how are portlets lait out when you add them by the add button instead of dragging?
14:21 <@jhf:#liferay> ah. to understand that, first, be aware that typical Portal pages are rectilinear (they are boxes of portlets laid out in one or more sets of columns on a page, resulting in what is described as "rectilinear" - lots of boxes, straight lights, 90-degree angles, etc0.  For any portal Page (called a "Layout" internally), there is a "Layout Template" that controls these columns and their widths.
14:21 <@jhf:#liferay> when you "add" them, I believe it will simply insert the new portlet into the first position of the first column.
14:22 <@jhf:#liferay> as defined by the layout template.
14:22 <@jhf:#liferay> layout templates: https://www.liferay.com/documentation/liferay-portal/6.2/development/-/ai/creating-liferay-layout-templates-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-09-en
14:24 < webczat:#liferay> whatabout next added portlets? I had the impression it adds bottom-up
14:30 < webczat:#liferay> not sure
14:36 < webczat:#liferay> I was able to add 5 of them on the default layout
14:45 < webczat:#liferay> and all of them looked like bottom-up
14:45 < webczat:#liferay> like first at the bottom
14:46 < webczat:#liferay> or it was the way screenreader presented it
14:53 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey jhf  -- are you still around?
15:01 <@jhf:#liferay> yup
15:06 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, I may have figured it out... but I also may still have a content question.
15:07 <@jhf:#liferay> ok
15:08 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, hmmm... ok I'll ask. Is it possible to generate a render url in a journal article template?
15:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> I think the answer is yes... but I found a few forum posts where people are asking the same and there are no answers
15:09 <@jhf:#liferay> yes I believe it is possible, since I know it is possible to generate a resource URL. lemme take a look.
15:10 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah.. $request.render-url
15:11 <@jhf:#liferay> err. it might be $request.theme-display.render-url
15:11 <@jhf:#liferay> checking
15:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> ah but I want to create a render url to a portlet on a different layout
15:11 <@jhf:#liferay> ohhh
15:12 <@jhf:#liferay> don't know.. doing some research (also known as google.com)
15:13 < jardineworks:#liferay> lol
15:13 < jardineworks:#liferay> hopefully your research skills are better than mine.
15:16 <@jhf:#liferay> so there is this $portletURLFactory object that could be used.
15:16 <@jhf:#liferay> investigating what it would take to pass it the right junk.
15:16 <@jhf:#liferay> 'cause it's never obvious from web content templates :)
15:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> no real request object
15:20 <@jhf:#liferay> exactly
15:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> but maybe renderRequest?
15:20 <@jhf:#liferay> no, it also has to be "real"
15:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> so there is no portlet request either?
15:20 <@jhf:#liferay> nope.. at least, not accessible from a web content template..
15:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> I did it elsewhere using JS
15:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> but I don't want the link to show javascript:xxx()
15:21 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah there is an easy way to do that with JS
15:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> Liferay.PortletURL...
15:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> yeah that workes, but its not very seo friendly
15:21 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah..
15:22 <@jhf:#liferay> so there is always one "brute force" way - which is to inject a custom java object into the velocity execution context
15:22 <@jhf:#liferay> which does whatever you want it to do, and would then be accessible from web content templates
15:23 <@jhf:#liferay> (same as with free marker to)
15:23 <@jhf:#liferay> *too
15:23 <@jhf:#liferay> is that something you would entertain?
15:23 <@jhf:#liferay> or do you want to find a way to do it with the OOTB stuff? it may be possible, but will take digging
15:24 < jardineworks:#liferay> OOTB would be preferred to be honest. Teh way you are suggesting I would need to service-pre and inject the full request object with each page load right?
15:36 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, are the variables added to the VelocityContext available in the journal templates?
15:44 <@jhf:#liferay> jardineworks: yep
15:44 <@jhf:#liferay> there's a way to declare them in a portal properties setting
15:44 < jardineworks:#liferay> :O
15:45 < jardineworks:#liferay> there is?
15:45 <@jhf:#liferay> and they are automatically injected into the context before web content articles are evaluated
15:45 < jardineworks:#liferay> you don't need a hook?
15:45 <@jhf:#liferay> no, you will need a hook.. since what you are declaring is a java class, it must get onto the class path somehow.
15:45 <@jhf:#liferay> you *could* stick it in manually before even starting the portal, but that's hacky
15:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, and the request changes from click to click :)
15:47 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah. well you don't inject an instance or a string, you inject a java object whose methods you can call from your template
15:48 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf,
15:48 < jardineworks:#liferay> oops
15:48 < jardineworks:#liferay> OR... just dump the request in :)
15:48 < jardineworks:#liferay> / store the hashmap under the webkey variable. Liferay will merge this in with the other
15:48 < jardineworks:#liferay> 		// vm variables that have already been defined.
15:48 < jardineworks:#liferay> 		request.setAttribute( WebKeys.VM_VARIABLES, velocityVariables );
15:49 < jardineworks:#liferay> that one? is accessible in the template?
15:49 < jardineworks:#liferay> I thought that was just in the theme
15:50 <@jhf:#liferay> hmm.. dang you might be right.
15:50 <@jhf:#liferay> there's gotta be a way to make portlet URLs without all these shenanigans
15:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> I think I know
15:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> make a class as you say...
15:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> put it in TOMCAT/lib/ext
15:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> so it is available to the portal...
15:52 < jardineworks:#liferay> and then use the .. thingee... to load the class
15:52 < jardineworks:#liferay> not the service locator...
15:53 < jardineworks:#liferay> like this -- $portal.getClass().forName('com.liferay.portal.kernel.log.LogFactoryUtil'))
15:53 < jardineworks:#liferay> but with my class instead
15:53 < jardineworks:#liferay> hmmm.. but it would need a request object as well
15:54 < jardineworks:#liferay> unless I had a list of constants -- gross.
15:54 < jardineworks:#liferay> why isn't the full request object in there anyway? ... seems like something that is totally reasonable.
15:55 < apucay:#liferay> curious, if you want a render url for a portlet on a different page, why not just link to the page? unless you need the portlet maximized
15:55 <@jhf:#liferay> one sec.. concall
16:03 < jardineworks:#liferay> apucay, that's the issue... I need to target a portlet on a layout.
16:03 < jardineworks:#liferay> apucay, so I need to generate a render url and then add a public render parameter to it
16:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> apucay, or anyone... do you know what class adds the variables to the velocity context for the journal article templates?
16:04 < webczat:#liferay> o, another thing. how too make good templates :D
16:06 < webczat:#liferay> I mean templates for structures. it was about the blind side, not the technical one
16:07 < jardineworks:#liferay> i guess I could do this -- http://www.liferay.com/community/forums/-/message_boards/message/978000 -- and then append the public render parameter manually
16:21 < webczat:#liferay> I deployed liferay on wildfly (like jboss-8). it works but says that hot deploy isn't supported while it managed to deploy the marketplace thing. wtf?
16:22 < apucay:#liferay> jardine, are you looking for JournalUtil._populateTokens()
16:24 < jardineworks:#liferay> apucay, looks like it... though since it is a map of strings, no point in overriding that, might as well just use the request attribtues as proposed by rotty in that link
16:24 < webczat:#liferay> like autodeploy works
16:43 < webczat:#liferay> agh
