00:16 < bradley:#liferay> does anyone know in velocity how when clicked to set a layout for the page
01:03 < Ababab:#liferay> Hi. Any ideas why my Liferay is suddenly running very slowly. I was on 6.1GA2 when this started, but I upgraded to GA3 to see if the problems would disappear. Something must have updated itself I guess.. If I take a thread dump, a thread called RubyExecutor is doing lot of work all the time
04:15 < w4l:#liferay> does anyone know to apply a bootstrap theme to liferay 6.2?
04:16 < w4l:#liferay> I got a nice theme and I need to install to liferay, but can't find how to install
04:16 < w4l:#liferay> appreciate ur help
04:20 < bjornjohansson_:#liferay> I think you can put the themes war-file directly under the deploy-folder
05:07 < Axxell:#liferay> Hey guys, just realied
05:07 < Axxell:#liferay> *Hey guys, just realised that liferay 6.2 has a welcome page.. that i seem to be unable to delete... it does not have the normal editing options as other pages have
05:11 < Axxell:#liferay> Is this normal? Havent seen this in any older versions of liferay, what could the problem be? How do i fix it?
05:14 < Axxell:#liferay> the error i get is Current URL /group/control_panel/manage?p_p_auth=akLkWyI5&p_p_id=156&p_p_lifecycle=2&p_p_state=maximized&p_p_mode=view&p_p_cacheability=cacheLevelPage&doAsGroupId=10181&refererPlid=10636&controlPanelCategory=sites&_156_treeId=layoutsTree&_156_groupId=10181&_156_tabs1=public-pages&_156_viewLayout=true&_156_redirect=%2Fgroup%2Fcontrol_panel%3FrefererPlid%3D10636%26p_p_id%3D134&_156_struts_action=%2Fgroup_pages%2Fedit_l
05:15 < Axxell:#liferay> generates exception: String index out of range: -1
05:41 < Axxell:#liferay> apparently this is an open issue, can be resolved by updating db by hand https://www.liferay.com/community/forums/-/message_boards/message/32478430
07:55 < w4l:#liferay> I have Liferay installed with LF 6.3 CE and I can't get the IDE to work correctly
07:55 < w4l:#liferay> tried to create theme, got error for UNRESOLVED DEPENDENCIES
07:56 < w4l:#liferay> is there a manual config for LF ide to create new theme ?
11:29 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Hey guys.
11:30 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Is there a known issue that Liferay's Documents & Media library freezes occasionally when used with S3 buckets as storage?
12:29 < jardineworks:#liferay> I think I might actually hate mysql.
14:24 < jardineworks:#liferay> Uncaught Error: WidgetPosition needs to be added to the Widget, before WidgetPositionAlign is added  -- awesome. Can't even get past the "basic configuration" screen with 6.2
14:34 < scribe:#liferay> Just got a call about a Liferay gig in NYC if anyone is interested.  The East coast doesn't sound appealing to me right now as I sit in the sunshine by the pool in AZ.
14:57 < jbonjean:#liferay> hi guys, do you know if there is a way to define multiple virtual hosts for a single community ?
14:57 < jbonjean:#liferay> or it's just with mod rewrite ?
15:04 < cr3:#liferay> is it normal that I have to signout and signin again after changing Control Panel -> My Account -> Display Settings -> Language?
