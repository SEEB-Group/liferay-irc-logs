06:22 < hufg:#liferay> helloo helloo
06:22 < hufg:#liferay> whats up
06:22 < hufg:#liferay> it's my last day on liferay :x
06:31 < topolik1:#liferay> hi hufg, was good to work with you!
06:32 < hufg:#liferay> hehe thanks thanks
06:33 < hufg:#liferay> no computer stuff for me for a year so i may write some blog posts and perhaps beat lps40416 with some megahack
07:50 < jardineworks:#liferay> hufg, no computer for a year? where you headed?
07:52 < hufg:#liferay> jardineworks: i'm doing civil service instead of army which will be hehe "janitor" at a school for teenagers aged 15-18
07:52 < jardineworks:#liferay> I guess that means that Finland still has conscription?
07:52 < hufg:#liferay> not too keen on fighting in wars caused by other peoples stupidity+greed
07:52 < hufg:#liferay> yes
07:54 < hufg:#liferay> it will be grreat, back to boxing, back to snowboarding and i have already paid for art lessons
07:55 < hufg:#liferay> 8)
07:55 < jardineworks:#liferay> that sounds awesome... and I couldnt agree more about the war non sense.
07:55 < jardineworks:#liferay> did your site go live yet?
07:55 < hufg:#liferay> no but it will ;)
07:55 < hufg:#liferay> i'll post a link once it comes
07:57 < jardineworks:#liferay> sounds good.
08:00 < hufg:#liferay> feeling good about it
08:00 < jardineworks:#liferay> so how does it work? does your company keep your position while you are away?
08:00 < hufg:#liferay> yes
08:00 < jardineworks:#liferay> or do you have to look for a new job in a year?
08:00 < hufg:#liferay> it's the law 8)
08:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> figured... makes sense
08:01 < hufg:#liferay> it's like a long unpaid vacation
08:02 < hufg:#liferay> during that time the you get your rent paid and some food in your mouth
08:02 < hufg:#liferay> and thats about it
08:03 < hufg:#liferay> and i guess no need for loan payments etc. and they will pay the interest
08:03 < jardineworks:#liferay> too bad you couldn't also go somewhere hot :)
08:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey topolik1 do you have a minute for a friendly url question?
08:05 < hufg:#liferay> hehe yeah
08:08 < hufg:#liferay> my first blog post would be "you suck, liferay doesn't"
08:08 < hufg:#liferay> a provocative tone to lessen the mythical aura of bullshit surrounding liferay
08:08 < hufg:#liferay> 8)
08:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> hahaha great title
08:09 < topolik1:#liferay> jardineworks: hi, try it :)
08:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik1, it's not working
08:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> :)
08:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> all the time...
08:10 < topolik1:#liferay> try harder :)
08:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> LOL
08:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> last night I did one, and it wasn't working... and then all of sudden magically it was working
08:10 < topolik1:#liferay> haha :D
08:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> this morning I am trying another which is also not working
08:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> and the magic still seems to be sleeping
08:11 < topolik1:#liferay> ok, let's wake it up :)
08:11 < topolik1:#liferay> I know children knows good wake-up spells
08:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> I think i understand how the mapper works (based on what I got working last night) .. but maybe if I could walk you through what I have...
08:12 < topolik1:#liferay> ok
08:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> my son could be a witch.
08:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> ok -- so first, my url http://localhost:8080/web/guest/recipes?p_auth=jU4TIJGH&p_p_id=recipesearch_WAR_recipeportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&p_p_col_id=column-1&p_p_col_count=1&_recipesearch_WAR_recipeportlet_javax.portlet.action=searchRecipes
08:13 < jardineworks:#liferay> (let me pastie a couple of things)
08:13 < topolik1:#liferay> ok
08:14 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik1, liferay-portlet.xml --> http://pastebin.com/AyNArx3v
08:15 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik1, recipe-search-friendly-url-routes.xml --> http://pastebin.com/EmuJUJHw
08:16 < jardineworks:#liferay> (fixing the pattern to be /)
08:17 < jardineworks:#liferay> and now it is working :S
08:18 < topolik1:#liferay> :D
08:19 < topolik1:#liferay> good job!
08:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> lol
08:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> my son just woke uo
08:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> up*
08:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> hahaha
08:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik1, can you have a route definition with no pattern? meaning <pattern/>?
08:21 < topolik1:#liferay> I don't know :)
08:21 < topolik1:#liferay> probably yes
08:22 < jardineworks:#liferay> what?! all my reading last night YOU were the guy answering all the friendly url questions :)
08:22 < topolik1:#liferay> haha :D
08:22 < topolik1:#liferay> you know how it is with my memory
08:22 < topolik1:#liferay> I frequently need to make space for new things :)
08:23 < jardineworks:#liferay> you should consider an upgrade. RAM is cheap these days.
08:26 < topolik1:#liferay> well, it seems that I  use only L2 caches :D
08:26 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik1, do you know if it is possible to put render parameters in the resulting friendly url?
08:26 < jardineworks:#liferay> haha
08:27 < topolik1:#liferay> what do you mean by the resulting friendly url?
08:27 < topolik1:#liferay> all parameters you append to the friendly URL should be OK
08:27 < topolik1:#liferay> and (on the other hand)
08:28 < topolik1:#liferay> you should be able to configure static parameters for any friendly URL in the XML
08:30 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik1,  in my code I forward the user at the end of the action to the render phase. before doing so I setParameter ... so sorry, not renderParameters, but basically parameters that are not appearing in the loooooooooong url. Specifically, I want to put the query into the url ... so if someone searches for meat sauce then I want it to show /recipe/-/search/meat-sauce ... right now it only shows /recipe/-/search
08:31 < jardineworks:#liferay> and when I remove the friendly url and look at the full url query string, my q parameter is not there
08:34 < topolik1:#liferay> jardineworks: uhm
08:34 < jardineworks:#liferay> am I asking a dumb question? :)
08:35 < topolik1:#liferay> no
08:35 < topolik1:#liferay> so in the action phase you set render parameter but the render parameter is not present in the render url, which is the nice friendly url ?
08:38 < jardineworks:#liferay> well, I am not setting it as a render parameter anymore... I was, but now I am creating a liferay portlet url and setting the parameter on it. Then at the end of the action, I am redirecting to that url.
08:38 < topolik1:#liferay> ok
08:38 < topolik1:#liferay> and that URL does not have the parameter?
08:39 < jardineworks:#liferay> well, I have not mapped it in my routes file so if it was there it should be showing (I think) .. but it is not.
08:50 < topolik1:#liferay> hmm, I need to try
08:50 < topolik1:#liferay> from code it seems it should work
08:50 < topolik1:#liferay> jardineworks: 6.1.2?
08:50 < jardineworks:#liferay> yep
08:54 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik1, and it broke my search!
08:54 < jardineworks:#liferay> :(
08:55 < jardineworks:#liferay> which would explain the parameters missing probably
09:04 < hufg:#liferay> anyone ever realized how absolutely amazing glassfish command line tooling is?
09:05 < hufg:#liferay> i could start selling liferay domain installation scripts like it's nothing!
09:06 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik1, This is like mad science. How would you create a map for this url? http://localhost:8080/web/guest/recipes?p_auth=jU4TIJGH&p_p_id=recipesearch_WAR_recipeportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&p_p_col_id=column-1&p_p_col_count=1&_recipesearch_WAR_recipeportlet_javax.portlet.action=searchRecipes
09:07 < jardineworks:#liferay> I set all the paramters to ignored, except the last one which I set to implicit.
09:07 < jardineworks:#liferay> but it doesn't work.
09:16 < topolik1:#liferay> jardineworks: I don't remember, honestly :/
09:16 < jardineworks:#liferay> :9
09:16 < topolik1:#liferay> but the important params are p_p_lifecycle and javax.portlet.action
09:17 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik1, ok -- so the issue is that I need the javax.portlet.action to be visible ... so how do I include it, but hide it?
09:17 < topolik1:#liferay> you should match these 2
09:17 < jardineworks:#liferay> implicit?
09:18 < topolik1:#liferay> looking at portal examples almost always the parameters are implicit
09:18 < topolik1:#liferay> thinking of it (trying to remember) - there are 2 processes
09:18 < topolik1:#liferay> 1. from params to friendly url
09:19 < topolik1:#liferay> 2. from friendly url to params
09:19 < topolik1:#liferay> implicit parameters seem to be hidden in URL but used in parameters
09:19 < jardineworks:#liferay> i see
09:19 < topolik1:#liferay> by "params" I mean parameters map
09:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> and the map only applies if ALL the parameters in the route definition are matched right?
09:20 < topolik1:#liferay> ok, looking at the DRD
09:20 < topolik1:#liferay> DTD
09:21 < topolik1:#liferay> ignored-parameter - Ignored parameters do not effect URL recognition.
09:21 < topolik1:#liferay> implicit-parameter -  is not present in the route pattern.
09:21 < topolik1:#liferay> overridden-parameter - a parameter that should be set to a certain value when a URL is recognized
09:22 < topolik1:#liferay> generated-parameter - a parameter that will be generated from other parameters when a URL is recognized
09:23 < topolik1:#liferay> so only implicit-parameter should be used to recognize the url to be built into friendly url
09:24 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik1, if I ignore all those parameters but set the javax.portlet.action as <implicit-parameter name="javax.portlet.action">searchRecipes</implicit-parameter> it should match... and the search recipes should still be passed in the parameter map
09:25 -!- mode/#liferay [+o jhf] by ChanServ
09:26 < topolik1:#liferay> jardineworks: I'm not sure that you need to ignore all the other params
09:27 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik1, but when you set somethin to implicit, then you need to specify the value right?
09:27 < topolik1:#liferay> or you don't need to specify it at all
09:27 < jardineworks:#liferay> so I would have to do <implicit-parameter name="p_p_mode">view</implicit-parameter> for example right?
09:27 < jardineworks:#liferay> oh
09:27 < jardineworks:#liferay> but if you don't specify it at all, it will be left in the url no?
09:28 < topolik1:#liferay> there are some ignored by default
09:28 < jardineworks:#liferay> oh
09:28 < jardineworks:#liferay> I didn;t know that
09:29 < topolik1:#liferay> https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/blob/6.1.1-ga2/portal-service/src/com/liferay/portal/kernel/portlet/DefaultFriendlyURLMapper.java#L55,L67
09:30 < topolik1:#liferay> I think they should be ignored or have a default value
09:30 < jardineworks:#liferay> so see.. if I just put the javax.portlet.action and the p_p_lifecycle as implicit parameters ... then my search fails
09:30 < jardineworks:#liferay> meaning the search action is never fired...
09:31 < jardineworks:#liferay> my portlet:actionURL seems to become a renderURL
09:34 < jardineworks:#liferay>  defaultReservedParameters.put("p_p_lifecycle", "0");
09:34 < jardineworks:#liferay> perhaps that should be overriden for me to 1
09:37 < topolik1:#liferay> yeah
09:38 < topolik1:#liferay> but that should be done with the lifecycle implicit param
09:41 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik1, ok .. so if I have nothing bu <route><pattern>/</pattern></route> ... then I see the p_p_id, p_p_col_id, etc removed and my form url is set to
09:41 < jardineworks:#liferay> http://localhost:8080/web/guest/recipes/-/search/?p_auth=jU4TIJGH&p_p_lifecycle=1&_recipesearch_WAR_recipeportlet_javax.portlet.action=searchRecipes
09:41 < jardineworks:#liferay> but, when I click it...
09:41 < jardineworks:#liferay> it doesn't go to the action phase.
09:42 < jardineworks:#liferay> it executes my render url
09:43 < jardineworks:#liferay> sorry -- render method
09:50 < topolik1:#liferay> hmm
09:50 < topolik1:#liferay> do you need the portlet id prefix for friendly urls?
09:53 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik1, not sure -- Liferay is just adding it for me
09:55 < topolik1:#liferay> hm, so liferay generates this url, but when you hit it it won't trigger the action phase?
09:55 < jardineworks:#liferay> right
09:59 < topolik1:#liferay> strange
10:00 < jardineworks:#liferay> ok -- from the top.
10:00 < jardineworks:#liferay> no friendly url configuration in the liferay-portlet.xml
10:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> in the page source for the action I see -- <form name="fm" method="post" action="http://localhost:8080/web/guest/recipes?p_auth=jU4TIJGH&amp;p_p_id=recipesearch_WAR_recipeportlet&amp;p_p_lifecycle=1&amp;p_p_state=normal&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-1&amp;p_p_col_count=1&amp;_recipesearch_WAR_recipeportlet_javax.portlet.action=searchRecipes"> <div class="chalkboard-large-content-container"> <div class="chalkboard-filter-container"> <div class=

10:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> woah
10:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> sorry
10:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> http://localhost:8080/web/guest/recipes?p_auth=jU4TIJGH&p_p_id=recipesearch_WAR_recipeportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&p_p_col_id=column-1&p_p_col_count=1&_recipesearch_WAR_recipeportlet_javax.portlet.action=searchRecipes
10:01 < hufg:#liferay> cheers! bye!
10:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> and when I do the search, it works
10:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> bye hufg  -- best o fluck
10:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> haha
10:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> of luck.
10:02 < jardineworks:#liferay> add in the friendly url mapping to liferay-portlet.xml --> http://pastebin.com/AyNArx3v
10:03 < jardineworks:#liferay> add in the route mapping --> http://pastebin.com/dLBNNQpH
10:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> url in the page source is now -- http://localhost:8080/web/guest/recipes/-/recipe/search?p_auth=jU4TIJGH&p_p_lifecycle=1&_recipesearch_WAR_recipeportlet_javax.portlet.action=searchRecipes
10:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> which makes sense... all the default stuff is being hidden
10:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> lifecycle and action are present so it should still work.
10:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> try to search ...
10:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> it worked :|
10:06 < jardineworks:#liferay> ok...
10:06 < jardineworks:#liferay> BUT!
10:06 < jardineworks:#liferay> I want to hide the action and the lifecycle.
10:07 < jardineworks:#liferay> update the route file to --> http://pastebin.com/H16cXQtM
10:08 < jardineworks:#liferay> and the url in the page source is --> http://localhost:8080/web/guest/recipes/-/recipe/search?p_auth=jU4TIJGH
10:08 < jardineworks:#liferay> which is right since now I am hiding the action and the lifecycle.
10:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> and the search works
10:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> :S
10:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> apparently I just needed to type out everything I was doing.
10:16 < jardineworks:#liferay> ... and it doesn't work. wtf.
10:17 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, do you have any experience with friendly urls?
10:23 <@jhf:#liferay> jardineworks: nope :(
10:30 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf -- no worries. I think I finally get it.
10:30 < jardineworks:#liferay> One more for the blog post list.
10:31 <@jhf:#liferay> (makes note of jardineworks as friendlyUrl expert)
10:31 < jardineworks:#liferay> yikes!
10:31 < jardineworks:#liferay> don't do that! lol
10:31 <@jhf:#liferay> (annotation: difficult to get along with)
10:31 <@jhf:#liferay> ;-)
10:37 < jardineworks:#liferay> haha
10:37 < jardineworks:#liferay> "not friendly"
10:37 < jardineworks:#liferay> funny -- like most things in your product, a horror to learn but once you understand how it works .. excellent design :)
10:38 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah... this year I'm going to start a bi-monthly 1-hour developer hangout, hoping to de-mystify many development tasks.. interested in holding a session? :)
10:39 < jardineworks:#liferay> for sure
10:39 <@jhf:#liferay> \o/ i'll follow up via email. probably some time in feb.
10:39 < jardineworks:#liferay> there is so much more content out there now than there was just a couple of years ago but its always the same
10:39 <@jhf:#liferay> (the session, not the follow-up) but its up to your (busy) schedule
10:40 < jardineworks:#liferay> "here is this neat thing... " ... and here is the simplest example of how to use it.
10:40 < jardineworks:#liferay> this project is supposed to roll out this month at which point I am hoping to hide from my clients for a few weeks ... maybe even the month of feb.
10:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, I'm still trying to find that rotty guy to ask him a question about search
10:52 <@jhf:#liferay> I'm assuming ray is still on holiday break... probably will be back next week though I dunno for sure!
10:53 < jardineworks:#liferay> breaks?! lazy canadians.
11:16 < webczat:#liferay> hey, anyone here?
11:19 < webczat:#liferay> I have another, problem without a workaround, I cannot add structures, like I don't find any function to do it
11:21 <@jhf:#liferay> webczat: 6.2? I believe in 6.2, the underlying mechanism supporting web content structures moved to the DDM infrastructure/libraries.
11:21 < webczat:#liferay> actually I see the site administration thing, manage structures and it displays a list of structures (empty at first) ant what else? nothing. I can search for structures, but cannot add them
11:22 <@jhf:#liferay> is there no 'add' button when you click on 'manage structures' ?
11:22 < webczat:#liferay> no
11:22 <@jhf:#liferay> hmmmmm... one sec, firing up 6.2. I'm pretty sure it's there, I've used it before.
11:22 <@jhf:#liferay> you logged in with sufficient privileges?
11:23 < webczat:#liferay> yes. it may be a pure accessibility issue
11:23 < webczat:#liferay> so if you see it and I don't...
11:25 <@jhf:#liferay> from the front page, I click on Admin->Content
11:25 <@jhf:#liferay> then click "Web Content"
11:25 <@jhf:#liferay> then "Manage" drop-down, pick "Structures"
11:25 <@jhf:#liferay> there is a bar at the top on the left of the bar is an "Add" link
11:25 < webczat:#liferay> ahm so I probably don't see the bar
11:25 <@jhf:#liferay> (on the right of the bar is a search box)
11:26 <@jhf:#liferay> manage->structures is in a popup
11:26 < webczat:#liferay> I see something that when I click on pulls the search box. no bar
11:26 <@jhf:#liferay> so yeah this sounds like an accessibility issue..
11:26 < webczat:#liferay> I know. and that may be a problem
11:26 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah there is a link on the left of that bar, entitled "Add" (with a plus button next to the word Add)
11:26 <@jhf:#liferay> it's a "real" link (not a javascript weird thing)
11:26 <@jhf:#liferay> so would be surprised if your screen reader does not "see" it
11:27 <@jhf:#liferay> when I hit 'tab' key, it's the first thing that gets highlighted
11:27 <@jhf:#liferay> however, if I try to use the spacebar to 'click' on the link, it doesn't worjk.
11:27 < webczat:#liferay> ha and i don't see the link. popups are problematic at least on my small netbook screen
11:28 < webczat:#liferay> because some things are collapsed and there is no way to exxpand. I would say this bug is critical for me because I wanted to make a structure for describing software projects
11:28 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah..
11:28 <@jhf:#liferay> what's the resolution of your screen?
11:28 < webczat:#liferay> who knows? erm
11:29 <@jhf:#liferay> when I squeeze down my browser window (to emulate a mobile device) the 'add' button disappears
11:29 < webczat:#liferay> and how do you expand it?
11:29 <@jhf:#liferay> I have to click the little button with 3 horizontal stripes to see the 'add' function
11:29 <@jhf:#liferay> do you 'see' a button next to the search button?
11:29 < webczat:#liferay> ahha so... is it a tcheme changing?
11:29 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah.. my guess is your netbook screen is small enough to trigger the responsive layout changes
11:29 < webczat:#liferay> hmmmmm wait a while
11:29 <@jhf:#liferay> and so stuff gets moved around and collapsed into mobile-friendly big buttons
11:30 < webczat:#liferay> I would happily enforce classic theme on everything
11:30 < webczat:#liferay> probably possible?
11:30 < webczat:#liferay> I see a button next to the search box, but I don't currently have this thingy opened
11:31 < webczat:#liferay> opening
11:34 < webczat:#liferay> page opened and I'm in manage\structures. what I see is something that is reported a clickable without label. pressing enter on it expands a search box
11:34 <@jhf:#liferay> is it possible for you to take a screenshot and upload it to imgur.com ?
11:34 < webczat:#liferay> and I see a search box.
11:35 < webczat:#liferay> hmm
11:35 <@jhf:#liferay> the other thing you could try is to screen-share with me (using http://join.me)
11:35 <@jhf:#liferay> so I can see what's going on
11:35 < webczat:#liferay> hmm is this button near search for advanced search?
11:35 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah that's an advanced search butto
11:36 <@jhf:#liferay> the 'add structure' button should come before it (in the link order of the popup
11:36 < webczat:#liferay> but there is no add link. the same happens if you trigger a mobile theme and then try to go to site pages. and then you are happy because you can't see the add page thing
11:37 <@jhf:#liferay> which netbook do you have?
11:37 < webczat:#liferay> acer AOA150
11:38 < webczat:#liferay> I'm going to try hard to enforce classic theme on mobile devices. or at least on my account
11:38 < webczat:#liferay> not sure if possible
11:38 <@jhf:#liferay> ok yeah when I run in that resolution, the theme changes to mobile-like
11:39 <@jhf:#liferay> and the 'add' link is gone (it's under the button with three horizontal stripes)
11:39 < webczat:#liferay> mhm
11:39 <@jhf:#liferay> so this sounds like an accessibility issue.
11:40 < webczat:#liferay> it seems then like a classic theme can be thought as "accessible mostly" and it's better not to use the mobile theme if you can. good to know. because now I can try to find more permanent workarounds.
11:42 < webczat:#liferay> I'm trying to find a platform to build my site, not just testing. and this one seems wonderful in the terms of available functions. but I wouldn't choose something that I cannot use
11:43 < webczat:#liferay> ok, still trying
11:44 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah, understood.. the 'classic' theme is one that, as of 6.2, has 'responsive design' - so it's designed to work across a range of screen sizes. It's not a "mobile theme" in that it doesn't detect your device type (like android vs. iOS vs. something else)
11:44 <@jhf:#liferay> it just changes its layout and uses modern html/js/css techniques to fit itself to whatever screen size you happen to be using (which is why I can easily emulate a 1024x600 netbook screen, even on my high resolution desktop, and see what happens)
11:45 <@jhf:#liferay> it is possible though to do traditional 'mobile device detection' and, for example, redirect foo.com to m.foo.com (which has a different, mobile-dedicated theme)
11:45 <@jhf:#liferay> that's different than using a universal 'responsive' theme though (like what we currently have by default, wit the "classic" theme)
11:45 < webczat:#liferay> I thought the mobile theme is a separate one.
11:46 < webczat:#liferay> okay. so what to do now...
11:46 <@jhf:#liferay> you can assign a mobile theme to be used when a particular device (or set of device families) is detected.
11:46 < webczat:#liferay> actually I'd be happy to disable responsiveness
11:46 <@jhf:#liferay> but the 'classic' theme as shipped with liferay doesn't do that - instead it uses special CSS classes to 'respond' to the size of the screen on which it is rendered.
11:46 <@jhf:#liferay> you could perhaps download and use a non-responsive theme from liferay.com/marketplace
11:47 < webczat:#liferay> of course. but this is a problem because it should also be accessible
11:47 < webczat:#liferay> and i can never guarantee this before testing
11:47 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah, it sounds like there is an accessibility bug in the classic theme.
11:47 <@jhf:#liferay> I would suggest filing a bug (if you haven't already)
11:48 < webczat:#liferay> any chances to fix those in 6.2? this one was reported by me today and I'm using 6.2.x git branch, not a GA release, so I will be able to use any fixes you give
11:48 <@jhf:#liferay> if they get fixed, they will most likely be fixed in trunk, but would probably be trivial to back port to 6.2.x
11:49 < webczat:#liferay> mhm not going to use trunk because I don't want unknown undocumented features in unknown places with unknown bugs from the development version
11:49 <@jhf:#liferay> the only time Liferay back ports to an earlier release (like 6.2) is either a) because a customer needs a patch, or b) we are going to do another 6.2 CE release (e.g. 6.2.1)
11:50 <@jhf:#liferay> so then you would need to back port it to 6.2.x once it's fixed on trunk (it would probably be trivial, like a one-liner somewhere)
11:50 <@jhf:#liferay> or wait for the next CE release :)
11:50 < webczat:#liferay> or I should download another theme
11:50 < webczat:#liferay> as I sait, it is few commits ahead of the GA1 thing
11:51 < webczat:#liferay> what theme would you recommend (in general)? or do you usually use a classic one?
11:52 <@jhf:#liferay> I usually use classic.. most 'real' public-facing websites that have professional dev/support usually contract to build their own. but there are several on liferay.com/marketplace that you could try out.
11:52 < webczat:#liferay> I don't mind all those menus, menu bars, javascript fancy things if I at least have a workaround to be able to use them
11:52 <@jhf:#liferay> there are a couple of commercial providers of themes as well
11:52 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah.. i'd be real curious to see why it doesn't work.
11:52 <@jhf:#liferay> so screenshot, screenshare, or something would be really helpful
11:53 < webczat:#liferay> just not sure how to take them. never done that on windows. linux is better, shows a save as dialog when someone presses printscreen
11:53 <@jhf:#liferay> so why are you using windows on a netbook then :)
11:54 < webczat:#liferay> because linux had more accessibility problems than it fixed.
11:55 < webczat:#liferay> like not from the beginning, just later. new releases were breaking stuff because so much changes were going. I think it stabilizes but I'm still on windows
11:56 <@jhf:#liferay> gotcha. do you have a larger desktop (or just a larger screen) somewhere, so that the 'responsiveness' of the classic theme reveals the 'add' link? i'm wondering if just a larger screen makes it all work for you.
11:57 < webczat:#liferay> hmm of course I do. but this computer has no operating system hahahaha
11:57 < webczat:#liferay> hmm this computer currently has two disks in raid0 and no os
11:58 <@jhf:#liferay> pfft.. operating systems are for n00bs
11:58 < webczat:#liferay> and I do have a screenshot in clipboard. tested in word because I can see when I have a graphic in the document while I can't in paint for example
11:58 <@jhf:#liferay> just code a browser in assembly.
11:58 <@jhf:#liferay> and upload it directly to memory by soldering some pins
11:58 < webczat:#liferay> could you please write me a specification of my NIC and soundcard? :D
11:59 <@jhf:#liferay> sure! I have a copy right here. that'll be $25,000 to license it to you.
12:00 < webczat:#liferay> yeah. I will take it. but I'll pay after... hmm I'll get those money.
12:00 < webczat:#liferay> so like after my death would be sufficient
12:01 <@jhf:#liferay> i'll give you a hint: pin 5 is GND
12:01 <@jhf:#liferay> the rest you have to reverse engineer
12:01 < webczat:#liferay> of course
12:02 < webczat:#liferay> I should now thank you by disabling a20 on your running ddevice. I just don't see from this distance if it's x86 or not haha
12:02 < webczat:#liferay> where to upload this image? forgot the url
12:03 <@jhf:#liferay> imgur.com
12:03 <@jhf:#liferay> no idea if that site is accessible though :)
12:04 < webczat:#liferay> ha ha. maybe it's not? :D I loooove them.
12:04 < webczat:#liferay> actually I'm not sure
12:06 < webczat:#liferay> hey, I'm getting angry.
12:06 < webczat:#liferay> next please :D
12:06 < webczat:#liferay> people don't like us haha
12:06 < webczat:#liferay> any other site?
12:07 <@jhf:#liferay> hmm
12:07 <@jhf:#liferay> http://postimage.org/
12:08 < webczat:#liferay> how nice. translation in polish. btw, polish translation of liferay needs a real fix :D
12:09 < webczat:#liferay> and this site will work
12:09 <@jhf:#liferay> well, I have just the team for you think
12:09 <@jhf:#liferay> http://www.liferay.com/community/wiki/-/wiki/Main/Liferay+Translation+Team
12:10 <@jhf:#liferay> https://www.liferay.com/community/wiki/-/wiki/Main/Translation+Team#section-Translation+Team-Polish+(pl)
12:10 <@jhf:#liferay> if you want to help with translations, I recommend posting to https://www.liferay.com/web/guest/community/forums/-/message_boards/category/1925364
12:10 <@jhf:#liferay> btw we have a polish subcategory on the forums: https://www.liferay.com/community/forums/-/message_boards/category/21045100
12:11 <@jhf:#liferay> and several active members and employees in Poland!
12:12 < webczat:#liferay> haha it all depends.
12:12 < webczat:#liferay> It would be hard for me to do something if I would be forced to uninstall liferay or something. if I'll be able to use it then I will probably try to fix the translation manually. and if I'll ever do, I'll share it.
12:15 < webczat:#liferay> do you see something?
12:15 < webczat:#liferay> http://s27.postimg.org/muiwo3per/screenshot.png
12:16 <@jhf:#liferay> yep. it appears you have triggered a search
12:16 <@jhf:#liferay> when I click on the search button (at your screen res, this appears to be as a magnifying glass icon), I see what you have in that screenshot
12:16 <@jhf:#liferay> a search entry box that takes up the whole width of the popup
12:16 <@jhf:#liferay> however, I only get that if I actually click on the magnifying glass button
12:17 <@jhf:#liferay> before that, I see the 'three horizontal stripe' button next to the magnifying glass icon
12:17 <@jhf:#liferay> if I trigger a search, then click 'outside' the search box, the long search entry box disappears and the original two buttons (magnifying glass and three-horizontal-stripe) come back
12:17 < webczat:#liferay> I am able to get to the search box
12:20 < webczat:#liferay> and where do you see the add button then?
12:20 <@jhf:#liferay> when I first click on Manage->Structures
12:20 <@jhf:#liferay> I see a box at the top, with two icons on the right
12:20 <@jhf:#liferay> a magnifying glass (search) and a three-horizontal-stripe button
12:21 <@jhf:#liferay> when I click the three-horizontal-stripe button, it reveals a small menu, on which there is only one option: "Add"
12:21 <@jhf:#liferay> only when I click on the magnifying glass button do I see the search entry box that you show in your screenshot
12:24 < webczat:#liferay> so why I see the one but not the other? two unlabelled clickable icons >>>  one unlabelled and one invisible
12:24 <@jhf:#liferay> that sounds like an accessibility problem - somewhere we are missing an important (likely related to ARIA) tag somewhere in the responsive classic theme
12:25 < webczat:#liferay> and...
12:25 < webczat:#liferay> I'm not sure what theme can I use.
12:26 < webczat:#liferay> and I'm not sure why liferay was able to deploy marketplace, but says that hot deploy is disabled
12:26 < webczat:#liferay> like unsupported, not disabled
12:26 <@jhf:#liferay> which app server are you using?
12:26 <@jhf:#liferay> or servlet container (e.g. Tomcat?)
12:26 < webczat:#liferay> hmm wildfly. it's ... you would say jboss8 if you don't know what wildfly is
12:27 < webczat:#liferay> compatible enough to run liferay properly with one exception: some bug in one or the other forced me to comment the gzip filter in web.xml :) but apart from that all instructions from jboss7 work
12:27 <@jhf:#liferay> ah yeah, that's a known issue - I don't think jboss8 (wildfly) is supported yet.
12:28 <@jhf:#liferay> the thing that detects whether hot deploy is enabled or not doesn't know about jboss8 .. yet.
12:28 <@jhf:#liferay> and it's long story as to why marketplace-portlet was able to be deployed :)
12:28 < webczat:#liferay> I would understand that it's not supported. but can't I tell the app that hot deploy is supported no matter what it thinks?
12:29 < webczat:#liferay> like "i.know.better"
12:30 < webczat:#liferay> ehm what a cool name for the portal.properties property. :D with a comment like "set to true if you want to use very advanced settings that override the autodetection logic"
12:30 <@jhf:#liferay> haha is there an override?? i did not know that.
12:30 <@jhf:#liferay> here's the code that attempts to detect hot deploy-ness: https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/blob/5a8640237521b2b8d68dd4a4fdfc478aa7426cf5/portal-impl/src/com/liferay/portal/server/capabilities/JBossServerCapabilities.java
12:31 < webczat:#liferay> mhm
12:33 < webczat:#liferay> what a hack...
12:33 < webczat:#liferay> anyway
12:33 < webczat:#liferay> I have the deployment scanner enabled, working etc. and as I sait marketplace has been deployed
12:34 < webczat:#liferay> also the deployment scanner in liferay is active
12:36 < webczat:#liferay> I actually have an additional test portal instance in my liferay installation with default passwords :D
12:37 <@jhf:#liferay> unfortunately, you happen to be on the bleeding edge of Liferay: brand new (unsupported) app server, polish language, relying on accessibility, and a netbook to boot. it's really great to see this!
12:37 <@jhf:#liferay> (to see that you've gotten that far).. we're not perfect, but this is a really useful test case. so I really appreciate you trying everything out :)
12:38 < webczat:#liferay> actually, it is the same server, just slightly newer so I'm surprised
12:38 < webczat:#liferay> and changed, j2ee7
12:39 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah....... java ee 7 was just finalized back in june.
12:39 < webczat:#liferay> and so everything except the gzip filter (probably wildfly bug that I've reported) and except hot deploy works normally
12:39 <@jhf:#liferay> and don't call it j2ee - you'll get in big trouble with the head java ee boss people
12:40 < webczat:#liferay> I know javaee7 was just finalized. and I just had to use it. I'm not a javaee7 developer (or actually not a javaee developer) but I'm going to learn it in the future.
12:41 < webczat:#liferay> and I have some basic knowledge about the theory
12:43 < webczat:#liferay> could you check how this portlet adding by add button works?
12:44 < webczat:#liferay> like how it lays out content
12:45 <@jhf:#liferay> for me, in 6.2, when I click the 'add' button, it's always added at the top of column 1
12:45 <@jhf:#liferay> (based on the layout template). most layout templates have 2 or 3 columns total, so apps always get added to the top of the first (left-most) column
12:46 < webczat:#liferay> okay so it's what I thought. I add bottom-up. it's uncomfortable :D
12:46 <@jhf:#liferay> that's weird.. hmm.. maybe it behaves differently in a small screen. testing..
12:46 < webczat:#liferay> top of the first column
12:47 < webczat:#liferay> I understood it as like it adds it always on the top
12:47 < webczat:#liferay> and this would mean that the second added portlet is above the first
12:47 <@jhf:#liferay> nope it also adds to the top of column 1 for me, even on small screens
12:47 <@jhf:#liferay> right, that's how it should work.
12:47 <@jhf:#liferay> does it not work like that for you?
12:47 < webczat:#liferay> hmm wait
12:47 < webczat:#liferay> the first portlet is added at the top of column1
12:48 < webczat:#liferay> the secon dportlet is where? below the first? or above the first?
12:48 <@jhf:#liferay> it should be above the first
12:48 < webczat:#liferay> so it's bottom-up adding. :D
12:49 < webczat:#liferay> the first is at the top, but then it goes down. and this is uncomfortable because I would rather first add naigation, then something etc
12:50 < webczat:#liferay> Is adding top to bottom a very bad idea visually?
12:51 < webczat:#liferay> how bad I cannot do like in gtk horizontal layouts
12:53 <@jhf:#liferay> well I am not a user experience expert, but I don't have a strong preference either way. you have more experience than me!
12:54 < webczat:#liferay> hmm resizing portlets adds to the picture, doesn't it?
12:55 <@jhf:#liferay> I suppose...
12:56 < webczat:#liferay> I don't imagine myself seeing this accessible. but at least saying that I want the portlet to occupy the second column and lie below the topmost
12:56 < webczat:#liferay> would be great
12:56 <@jhf:#liferay> what if there are 3 columns?
12:56 < webczat:#liferay> what if you would add a selection of columns? like set a column, set where, set what etc
12:57 <@jhf:#liferay> there's another wrinkle: layout templates can also contain multiple sets of columns. so for example you have three columns at the top of the page, then a single column below that, then below that are two columns. so it's more like a grid from that perspective.
12:57 <@jhf:#liferay> 3-1-2
12:57 <@jhf:#liferay> or 3-2-3 or something.
12:58 < webczat:#liferay> :D:D:D
12:59 < webczat:#liferay> I would say i don't imagine myself seeing this really accessible and it's the thing I understand
12:59 < webczat:#liferay> because I don't know how a screenreader would ever be able to describe something like that
13:00 < webczat:#liferay> answering your question: it is possible to once ask how does this layout look like or something, then I can do what I want
13:02 <@jhf:#liferay> when you add a portlet to a page, it is done via client-side ajax and DOM manipulation.. I imagine screen readers don't take too kindly to that kind of in-place surgery?
13:03 < webczat:#liferay> no problem with it suddenly appearing, really
13:04 < mvlach:#liferay> hi all
13:04 < mvlach:#liferay> i have problem with thema
13:04 < webczat:#liferay> aye
13:04 < mvlach:#liferay> i created custom design and I want do use dockbar.css
13:05 < mvlach:#liferay> but the build remove this definition from css file
13:05 < mvlach:#liferay> know somebody why ?
13:05 < mvlach:#liferay> [java] Parsed /home/mvlach/liferay-plugins-sdk-6.2.0/themes/JVTheme-theme/docroot/css/dockbar.css in 95 ms
13:08 < apucay:#liferay> are your theme files not in the _diffs folder/
13:08 < apucay:#liferay> ?
13:12 < webczat:#liferay> jhf: what theme does liferay itself have?
13:12 <@jhf:#liferay> you mean liferay.com  (the website)?
13:13 < webczat:#liferay> yes
13:13 <@jhf:#liferay> it's a custom theme that's not open source :)
13:14 <@jhf:#liferay> also, liferay.com currently runs Liferay Portal 6.1 EE
13:14 < mvlach:#liferay> apucay: yes - my files are in _diff folder
13:15 < webczat:#liferay> okay, now a question. if an app says it's requirement is 6.1, does it mean 6.1 up so 6.2 too, or 6.1 only?
13:17 < apucay:#liferay> mvlach, and the build is removing it from the _diffs folder?
13:17 < webczat:#liferay> because it doesn't have a version for 6.2 but it may be compatiblee
13:17 <@jhf:#liferay> webczat: Marketplace apps, when they say "6.1+" means any 6.1, but NOT 6.2
13:17 <@jhf:#liferay> and when you're talking themes, it is most likely NOT going to work in 6.2 if it was built in 6.1.
13:18 <@jhf:#liferay> because of the major UI changes in 6.2 and associated incompatible css/js/html changes in themes.
13:18 < webczat:#liferay> oh my. so what now? was any theme created for 6.2 yet?
13:18 <@jhf:#liferay> it happens every release, unfortunately. themes are one of the last bastions of "too hard to really make compatible from release to release" however there is a tool that our UI team wrote to do most of the conversion from 6.1 to 6.2 if interested.
13:19 < webczat:#liferay> I'm not going to do any more hacks
13:19 <@jhf:#liferay> I don't think so, but work is in progress to upgrade the existing themes (at least those written by Liferay) to be 6.2 compatible.
13:20 < webczat:#liferay> so am I stuck? :D
13:20 < webczat:#liferay> I don't feel like downgrading
13:21 <@jhf:#liferay> so is the only thing blocking you the inability to add structures?
13:22 < webczat:#liferay> hmmm actually
13:22 < webczat:#liferay> structures, templates... all popups that are resized block me, I'm not sure if any other exist
13:23 <@jhf:#liferay> oh also.. can you try different browsers on that netbook? like firefox, chrome, IE.. see if they all have the same accessibility issue?
13:24 < webczat:#liferay> yes, I could. ie has a strange issue like it does not allow me to log in, liferay says that I should enable cookies while they are enabled. chrome hmm has probably the same accessibility problems + the next one because in chrome I don't see a label of many menus.
13:24 < webczat:#liferay> but I'm not sure if chrome is a very good browser for accessibility in general, although I could use it.
13:25 < webczat:#liferay> problems over problems :D
13:26 < webczat:#liferay> when liferay started it's accessibility work as a whole?
13:27 <@jhf:#liferay> a long time ago, actually.. it began with a "section 508 theme"
13:27 <@jhf:#liferay> way back in like 2007
13:27 < webczat:#liferay> mhm it's possible 6.1 was accessible. not sure though
13:27 <@jhf:#liferay> also, you may be interested in Julio's blog post: https://www.liferay.com/web/julio.camarero/blog/-/blogs/liferay-accessible-websites
13:27 <@jhf:#liferay> listing accessible sites built on Liferay
13:28 <@jhf:#liferay> and some other useful links
13:28 < webczat:#liferay> I would assay leray.com itself is rather accessible
13:28 < webczat:#liferay> *liferay.com
13:28 <@jhf:#liferay> yay!
13:28 <@jhf:#liferay> it's actually easier to make an accessible website as compared to making Liferay itself accessible :)
13:28 < webczat:#liferay> but too bad I don't have any theme
13:29 <@jhf:#liferay> well I imagine if you tried to access the administrative interfaces on liferay.com you'd run into issues.
13:29 < webczat:#liferay> maybe, but not necessarily
13:30 <@jhf:#liferay> although ,the theme is definitely simpler than the 6.2 one.. but there is also a separate theme for control panel, which you don't see on liferay.com, and it's likely not nearly as accessible
13:30 < webczat:#liferay> actually liferay's control panel is 100% accessible, site admin pages have problems, etc. popups have problems because they are mobile when the rest of the page is not
13:30 <@jhf:#liferay> ah so its the popups.. yeah 6.1 has much less popups.
13:31 < webczat:#liferay> not only but mainly. it's the theme's adaptive behaviour, not popups. popups itself are nice.
13:31 < webczat:#liferay> eee wait a while buhaha
13:34 < webczat:#liferay> ok, nothing. I probably had the screen turned to the horizontal position by accidental keypress
13:34 < webczat:#liferay> but it didn't change anything so nevermind
13:35 < webczat:#liferay> popups work. the problem is just when they are resized to the mobile standards
13:36 < webczat:#liferay> so not sure what are my options excluding switching to things like drupal (at least temporarily) or something
13:36 < webczat:#liferay> or to previous version of liferay
13:37 <@jhf:#liferay> I would see if you can make progress with Julio - my guess is it's a really simple fix, but I don't know anything about ARIA or accessibility so have to rely on the experts.
13:49 < webczat:#liferay> i'm just very impatient
13:50 < webczat:#liferay> those popups are problematic, impossible to disable completely
13:50 < webczat:#liferay> and always show the reduced theme so you never know what you miss unless it's as trivial as an add button
13:51 < webczat:#liferay> maybe portal.properties can disable or change a way the theme resizes?
13:55 < webczat:#liferay> btw what's minification? :D
13:59 <@jhf:#liferay> magnification? it is the stripping of whitespace and changing long variable names to short variable names
13:59 <@jhf:#liferay> from content that goes across the wire in textual form (e.g. css and javascript)
13:59 <@jhf:#liferay> the idea is to minimize network traffic and parsing effort
14:00 <@jhf:#liferay> so 'var superLongVar = 2 ;" becomes "var b=2;"
14:00 <@jhf:#liferay> then superLongVar is replaced with 'b' everywhere :)
14:00 <@jhf:#liferay> and so forth.. and so on..
14:01 < webczat:#liferay> nevermind
14:09 < webczat:#liferay> there is even a bug in the editor. if I'll add a link and then try to read this line, reading will stop at the link
14:09 < webczat:#liferay> I will not hear what the link is unless I use arrows
14:13 < webczat:#liferay> this is a minor issue when editing, major when you read something
14:15 < webczat:#liferay> because you don't know that you hit a link
14:16 <@jhf:#liferay> so you mean when your screenreader tries to read the content inside the WYSIWYG editor?
14:16 <@jhf:#liferay> what if you publish it out to a 'real' webpage, does it work as epxected?
14:17 < webczat:#liferay> it's just html. it would be really strange if it would not work
14:18 < webczat:#liferay> but in the editor, using arrows to read it triggers the bug. if you know that it's a link there you can use left/right and navigate to it and then it will work.
14:18 < webczat:#liferay> like I could edit links that I created in my mail notifications
14:18 <@jhf:#liferay> so when you said "major issue when you read something" - someone who is only reading something presumably is NOT using a WYSIWYG editor, but just reading the webpage as a traditional webpage, no?
14:19 < webczat:#liferay> but I couldn't see them when navigating line by line
14:19 < webczat:#liferay> by reading I meant reading in the editor. when you don't know what is it that you just need to edit and look around
14:20 < webczat:#liferay> the only thing I don't know is if it'll also happen if I'll put a link in a separate line.
14:20 <@jhf:#liferay> ah I see
14:20 <@jhf:#liferay> hmm
14:20 < webczat:#liferay> and not sure if it affects other things in the editor
14:21 < webczat:#liferay> too many accessibility bugs at once
14:23 < webczat:#liferay> I just want to make a website. So not sure if I want/can wait so long. not like it's time-constrained because it isn't. but it just took too long for me to set up my vm for it, I'm a lazy person :)
14:23 <@jhf:#liferay> coeditor is supposedly super-accessible
14:23 < webczat:#liferay> hm? :D
14:24 <@jhf:#liferay> http://ckeditor.com/blog/CKEditor-4.0.1-Released
14:24 <@jhf:#liferay> "CKEditor has a reputation for caring about accessibility, so this version includes numerous updates as well as improved Inline Editing compatibility with the JAWS screen reader."
14:24 <@jhf:#liferay> sooo
14:24 <@jhf:#liferay> maybe they don't test with NVDA :/
14:25 < webczat:#liferay> maybe
14:26 < webczat:#liferay> but when you read text, it's pretty good. as I sait, I know what I edit if it's not a link. and if I know where a link is, and navigate to it by character/etc, it says it's a link, i can see it, edit it etc
14:27 < webczat:#liferay> tested. worse if you don't know that you edit a link
14:27 < webczat:#liferay> or rather that here's a link. sometimes you know it because of the context of the sentence and sometimes you don't
14:27 < webczat:#liferay> editor menus/dialogs work.
14:29 < webczat:#liferay> what does liferay actually use?
14:30 <@jhf:#liferay> ckeditor 4.0.6
14:30 <@jhf:#liferay> err
14:30 <@jhf:#liferay> 4.0.3
14:30 < webczat:#liferay> mhm
14:31 < webczat:#liferay> actually a web editor like that is itself a very interesting idea for me when I'm used to normal textarea fields
14:32 < webczat:#liferay> and I can't believe it's still a webpage haha
14:32 < webczat:#liferay> I know what html5 can do but
14:32 < webczat:#liferay> I even know an accessible example of what html5 can do. like a game platform
14:33 < webczat:#liferay> it even includes the fact that nvda automatically reads what happens on the screen
14:34 < webczat:#liferay> so I must get used to the fact that html5 can do such things
14:37 < webczat:#liferay> so what would you recommend to do?
14:44 <@jhf:#liferay> can you post your findings to the ckeditor community and see if this is a known issue (and potentially find a workaround)?
14:46 < webczat:#liferay> this question was a general one, not for the ckeditor. it's one issue of few in liferay itself and I'm wondering what to try.
14:47 <@jhf:#liferay> I would write down all of the issues you've found so far, and post it to the accessibility forum (https://www.liferay.com/community/forums/-/message_boards/category/1229220)
14:48 < webczat:#liferay> why there?
14:48 <@jhf:#liferay> Julio can probably tell you straight away how much chance there is to get them fixed (or find suitable workarounds)
14:48 < webczat:#liferay> mhm
14:48 <@jhf:#liferay> it's the place where Liferay Accessibility questions go
14:49 <@jhf:#liferay> interesting.. the poland user group was the #2 most visited user group in december
14:49 < webczat:#liferay> if it would be possible to disable responsiveness...
14:49 < webczat:#liferay> whaaat? :D:D:D
14:50 < webczat:#liferay> maybe because of the really stupid translation errors? :D example: go to content was translated to "przejdź do komentarzy" and to my knowledge it would mean go to comments. :D
14:50 < webczat:#liferay> and some things were not translated at all
14:52 < webczat:#liferay> translation errors are okay as long as someone can fix them. because I could in theory do this, and because the maiin language of the website would be english, it's acceptable
14:53 < webczat:#liferay> accessibility bugs are not :)
14:53 < webczat:#liferay> like if no workarounds exist
15:01 <@jhf:#liferay> well guess what my friend
15:01 <@jhf:#liferay> translations are done through an automated website: translate.liferay.com
15:01 <@jhf:#liferay> http://translate.liferay.com/pootle/pl/portal/
15:01 <@jhf:#liferay> there are 11,017 words awaiting your contribution
15:02 <@jhf:#liferay> you ARE considering contributing, right? :)
15:02 <@jhf:#liferay> lets find that broken translation
15:02 <@jhf:#liferay> http://translate.liferay.com/pootle/pl/portal/Language_pl.properties/translate/?search=przejd%C5%BA+do+komentarzy&sfields=source&sfields=target
15:03 <@jhf:#liferay> someone didn't know what content meant (vs. commentary)
15:03 <@jhf:#liferay> clearly they need you :)
15:03 <@jhf:#liferay> so if you log in (using your liferay.com screen name and password)
15:03 <@jhf:#liferay> you will be able to provide the right translation
15:03 <@jhf:#liferay> it will be reviewed by the leaders for this language's translation
15:03 <@jhf:#liferay> and approved (most likely) in short order
15:04 <@jhf:#liferay> and then you can volunteer to become leader, so you can automatically approve your own suggestions :)
15:06 < webczat:#liferay> I'm not considering such things actually first because I'm not sure what will happen with my liferay installation, and also because I'm not sure if I will have time for that, I'm still at highschool.
15:09 < webczat:#liferay> but this one really annoys me and I'm going to fix it :D but not sure how to apply changes? :D
15:09 <@jhf:#liferay> well you can't, you can only "suggest" changes until you become a 'translation leader'
15:09 <@jhf:#liferay> (which requires approval from Julio and the current PL language lead)
15:10 < webczat:#liferay> of course. and I'm not going to become one unless I'll be sure that I know what I'm doing. but anyway, how to send suggestions? just go to next?
15:12 < webczat:#liferay> like I've edited this thing
15:12 < webczat:#liferay> and went next
15:12 < webczat:#liferay> unless I need to actually log in separately?
15:13 < webczat:#liferay> ahhh
15:13 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah you need to log in first
15:17 < webczat:#liferay> oka
15:21 < webczat:#liferay> proposed.
15:22 <@jhf:#liferay> \o/
15:22 <@jhf:#liferay> (what does your screenreader speak for that one :) )
15:22 <@jhf:#liferay> you should change it to recognize it and replace it with the sound of a roaring crowd
15:23 < webczat:#liferay> ee? :D
15:23 < webczat:#liferay> how could I tell you what it says? :D
15:23 <@jhf:#liferay> this: \o/  (backslash followed by the letter o followed by a forward slash)
15:23 <@jhf:#liferay> it's me raising my hands and saying "YEAH!!!"
15:24 < webczat:#liferay> a. didn't notice that :D:D
15:24 <@jhf:#liferay> hehehe
15:24 <@jhf:#liferay> yup
15:24 < webczat:#liferay> because it's so normal for me that I didn't even think that you meant that
15:24 <@jhf:#liferay> \o/ or \^o^/ — the 'yayman', representing the pose that someone with something to celebrate might adopt. In contexts such as forums, where small images replace emoticons, some type of happy emoticon image often replaces the 'o'.
15:24 < webczat:#liferay> hmm going to disable helo verification. I believe liferay fails helo verification
15:25 < webczat:#liferay> like liferay.com sending emails to my server
15:26 < webczat:#liferay> alright! :D
15:27 < webczat:#liferay> like I use the email I gave you, but I registered on liferay.com using the email from my domain because the liferay portal instance works on it
15:28 <@jhf:#liferay> I see..
15:28 < webczat:#liferay> and liferay.com couldn't send emails to me probably failing helo verification server-side
15:28 < webczat:#liferay> but not sure if it still does.
15:28 < webczat:#liferay> I know that sender verification passes
15:29 < webczat:#liferay> nevermind. looks like I'll need to wait for those issues to be resolved or something
15:31 < webczat:#liferay> I wanted to make a structure with things like a description header, etc. or maybe ... better to have a page template in this case? like a project page containing project descriptions, links to it's forum, developer instructions, etc...
15:31 < webczat:#liferay> I'm completely unexperienced in any form of webpage development or normal content editing
15:33 <@jhf:#liferay> ok.. site and page templates are useful when you know you'll be creating many copies of the same (or very similar) pages.
15:33 <@jhf:#liferay> or set of pages (i.e. a site)
15:34 <@jhf:#liferay> but for individual parts of a page, such as a list of links or developer instructions, you'd probably want to create a structure/template (which serves the same purpose as page templates - a way to make something once and make it easy to be repeated later)
15:39 < webczat:#liferay> actually it is going to later be a site template
15:39 < webczat:#liferay> because I'll host several projects
15:39 <@jhf:#liferay> ah cool. then yeah page templates, site templates, and structured web content is the way to go.
15:40 <@jhf:#liferay> they all serve the same purpose - scalable website creation and management :)
15:40 < webczat:#liferay> not sure if I shoult make a structured web content at all, or just a description header with web content portlet, below a related links header with another portlet etc
15:41 < webczat:#liferay> and let's resolve the problem of structures that i cannot create. luckily I can create site/page templates and also I'm able to edit structures in xml I believe
15:41 <@jhf:#liferay> just depends on how much leeway and editorial control you wish to give to your site owners
15:41 <@jhf:#liferay> I mean you can just stick and unstructured web content article on there, and let site owners go nuts with html/css/js, but then you might end up with myspace.com all over again
15:43 < webczat:#liferay> it's just like: 1. write a short description. 2. bugtracker is hosted on our bugzilla, git is hosted on our gerrit, maven is more global and hosted somewhere else in our server. it's actually my personal website but I like doing such things. I don't currently expect others to edit it, but I'd like to make it possible.
15:45 < webczat:#liferay> like I'd like to host my own ideas on it, no matter what will it look like later, I'm an amateur programmer and didn't finish any of my larger ideas, but I can still try :D
15:47 < webczat:#liferay> one of the newest is the windows api integration for java that I believe does not really exist
16:53 < pnutbutr:#liferay> anyone know if liferay supports active directory authentication?
16:53 < pnutbutr:#liferay> or more specifically, I'm trying to create a portlet that communicates with a third party which authenticates using active directory
16:54 < pnutbutr:#liferay> I'd like to authenticate once in liferay against active directory, and have that same authentication session be applied to the third party I'm communicating with in my portlet
16:54 < pnutbutr:#liferay> any suggestions where I could look for resources on how to implement this?
16:55 < pnutbutr:#liferay> most of the docs I've found are for integrating liferay to active directory for authentication, but not passing that authentication to a third party through a portlet
18:57 < apucay:#liferay> what do you mean by passing that authentication to a third party?
18:59 < apucay:#liferay> i think all LDAP auth does is check that there is a user is on the LDAP server with the user/pass combo that you give it
19:03 < apucay:#liferay> you can create an auto login hook modeled after RequestHeaderAutoLogin
