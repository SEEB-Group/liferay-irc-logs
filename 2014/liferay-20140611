09:05 < modd_:#liferay> why is it still not possible to select more than one category in liferays faceted search?
09:06 < modd_:#liferay> btw there's a bug then unchecking assets in the basic config of the search portlet
09:44 < sm`:#liferay> Hello
09:44 < sm`:#liferay> how do i get the text from <option> field
09:44 < sm`:#liferay> in the processAction method?
09:44 < sm`:#liferay> i seems ParamUtil.getString(field, request) returns the 'value' tag
09:45 < sm`:#liferay> nad i need the text
10:14 < topolik:#liferay> Hi, the option text/label is not submitted by the HTML form => you cannot read it from the request
10:15 < topolik:#liferay> but you could use JavaScript to copy the text into a hidden input when the <option> is selected ... hint: <select onchange=...>
13:40 < bijoo__:#liferay> rocknrol1_ need to define in portlet.xml
13:41 < bijoo__:#liferay> rocknrol1_: once you do that, you can get that param
13:44 < bijoo__:#liferay> rocknrol1_: Googling Liferay IPC gave this https://t.seebgroup.com/liferay-ipc-example
14:08 < bijoo__:#liferay> modd: not sure, but this why open source is great: you have access to add feature here
14:20 < modd:#liferay> ..and do it again with every new version because of breaking old code...yes
14:51 < bijoo__:#liferay> modd: no what I mean is to add it to core
14:53 < modd:#liferay> if lr staff don't want to add it, it won't be added to core
15:19 < bijoo__:#liferay> modd: true but unlikely since has value; plus it'll get added if has lots of votes; so openining JIRA ticket helps much; and advertise ticket in these channels (forum/IRC/community blog).
15:38 < modd:#liferay> i have already some tickets with feature request and even proposed code changes...most are open since months without comment :P
15:52 < bijoo__:#liferay> modd: yea, ticket system's like a firehose; need to bring attention to right person; https://issues.liferay.com/browse/LPS
15:52 < bijoo__:#liferay> modd: that page has leads for all the components
15:54 < bijoo__:#liferay> modd: People to check into:  Eudaldo Alonso (search in general, search framework, web content search portlet),  Raymond Auge (search portlet, lucene impl),  Michael Han (Elastic search impl), Marcellus Tavares (solr search)
15:55 < bijoo__:#liferay> modd: contacting them may help bring attention; and you can work with one to streamline it
15:56 < bijoo__:#liferay> modd: what are the LPS you submitted?
16:00 < modd:#liferay> most of them won't work anymore because they were designed for 6.1.20
16:01 < modd:#liferay> I did some changes to the search portlet a while ago to allow multiple tags- and category-selections, but I can't find the code :\
16:02 < modd:#liferay> moreover the 6.2 code looks slightly different, so far the code changes I remember doesn't work
16:02 < modd:#liferay> I have to dig deeper tomorrow
16:03 < modd:#liferay> another point I would need: some documentation about the workflow management system build in into liferay. I want to replace kaleo with camunda. I asked e.g. rotty3000 but never got an answer^^
16:11 < bijoo__:#liferay> modd: nice; for workflow, look on that page again.
16:12 < bijoo__:#liferay> modd: Tavares and Lundgren are your guys there.
