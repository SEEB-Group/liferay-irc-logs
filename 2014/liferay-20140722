09:46 < Yam`:#liferay> hi
10:42 < Yam`:#liferay> I created a "Liferay Portlet"  type "Theme" in Liferay's Developer Studio and just let it create the theme and did nothing with it. I tried then to make a page use this theme in Liferay but it displayed the following error:
10:42 < Yam`:#liferay> javax.servlet.jsp.JspException: com.liferay.portal.kernel.template.TemplateException: Unable to process template Red-theme_SERVLET_CONTEXT_/templates/portal_normal.ftl
10:42 < Yam`:#liferay> Have I missed something?
10:44 < jardineworks:#liferay> Yam`, you mean you created a Liferay PLUGIN that is a theme type ... so you made a Liferay Theme Plugin right?
10:44 < Yam`:#liferay> that must be it jardineworks
10:44 < jardineworks:#liferay> Yam`, and di dyou do it through the UI?
10:45 < jardineworks:#liferay> meaning eclipse IDE
10:45 < jardineworks:#liferay> oh you did
10:45 < jardineworks:#liferay> you said that
10:45 < Yam`:#liferay> yes I did haha
10:45 < jardineworks:#liferay> is there a reason you chose FTL? or just because that was the default?
10:46 < Yam`:#liferay> It must be the default because I don't see it anywhere when I try to create another liferay theme plugin
10:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> Yam`, ok, do you mind doing it again with me?
10:46 < Yam`:#liferay> (I don't even know what this is)
10:46 < Yam`:#liferay> not at all
10:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> ftl is the extension for freemaker ... which is a templating language.
10:47 < Yam`:#liferay> ok
10:47 < jardineworks:#liferay> the other option that I think is typically more commonly used is velocity (.vm)
10:47 < jardineworks:#liferay> right click on the current project and delete it ... make sure you check the box to remove all the files as well. (that way you can use the same name)
10:48 < Yam`:#liferay> ok it's done
10:48 < Yam`:#liferay> I've got an error while deleting
10:48 < jardineworks:#liferay> what was the error?
10:49 < Yam`:#liferay> "An exception has been caught while processing the refactoring 'Delete Resource'
10:49 < Yam`:#liferay> Reason:
10:49 < Yam`:#liferay> Problems encountered while deleting resources."
10:50 < jardineworks:#liferay> check on the disk and make sure it is gone.
10:50 < jardineworks:#liferay> if not then rm -rf it
10:51 < Yam`:#liferay> (I'm on windows now :()
10:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> also make sure that it is not in the TOMCAT_HOME/webapps directory
10:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> ok.. right click delete :)
10:51 < Yam`:#liferay> nope it's in liferay-plugins-sdk-6.2/themes
10:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> do a rmdir /s on it
10:52 < Yam`:#liferay> thank's I could not delete it with the GUI even after stopping the liferay servr
10:52 < Yam`:#liferay> +e
10:52 < jardineworks:#liferay> probably permissions... you need to open those windows "As an Administrator" I bet
10:53 < jardineworks:#liferay> anyway... all gone now?
10:53 < jardineworks:#liferay> including from the webapps?
10:53 < Yam`:#liferay> yes it's gone
10:54 < jardineworks:#liferay> ok.. back to eclipse.
10:54 < jardineworks:#liferay> we're going to make a theme but specify velocity. Are you using ANT or Maven?
10:55 < Yam`:#liferay> ANT
10:57 < jardineworks:#liferay> ad
10:57 < jardineworks:#liferay> oops
10:57 < jardineworks:#liferay> ah
10:57 < jardineworks:#liferay> on... so create your project using the normal New > Liferay Plugin Project .. fill in the fields and specify a plugin type of "Theme"
10:58 < jardineworks:#liferay> (I'm doing it at the same time
10:58 < jardineworks:#liferay> )
10:58 < Yam`:#liferay> jardineworks, done
10:58 < jardineworks:#liferay> Wait!
10:58 < jardineworks:#liferay> lol
10:58 < jardineworks:#liferay> did you click NEXT? or FINISH?
10:58 < Yam`:#liferay> No, no :')
10:58 < jardineworks:#liferay> You wanna click NEXT
10:59 < jardineworks:#liferay> then choose _unstyled from the first drop down, and velocity from the second
10:59 < Yam`:#liferay> oh right that's there
10:59 < Yam`:#liferay> done
10:59 < jardineworks:#liferay> ok ... so you have a new project now right?
10:59 < Yam`:#liferay> yes
11:00 < jardineworks:#liferay> in your ANT view (little window) .. double click the name to deploy it.
11:00 < Yam`:#liferay> done
11:00 < jardineworks:#liferay> ok -- now log into the portal as the adminitrator
11:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> Create a new page called "Test Theme" or something
11:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> then once it is created, go to that page
11:02 < Yam`:#liferay> I'm starting the server..
11:03 < jardineworks:#liferay> ok
11:05 < Yam`:#liferay> It's done
11:07 < jardineworks:#liferay> ok -- so go to your new page and the "Edit it" with that little pencil and paper on the left.
11:07 < jardineworks:#liferay> Scroll down a bit and find the "Look and Feel" section
11:08 < jardineworks:#liferay> Check the radio button for "Define Custom Look and Feel for this page"
11:08 < jardineworks:#liferay> Scroll down further and fine the "Available Themes" section... and there you will find you theme you just deployed.
11:08 < jardineworks:#liferay> Choose the radio button beside it and save.
11:09 < Yam`:#liferay> Ok, but isn't themes supposed to be the same as the classic except for the differences in the _diffs folder ?
11:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> it should be pretty ugly because your theme is based on the _unstyled theme
11:09 < Yam`:#liferay> yes it is
11:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> it could be the same as classic, but to do that you need to specify that as the theme it "inherits" from. If you are building your own theme that is likely different from the default one, I persoanlly have found it easier to start with the unstyled.
11:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> in the _diffs folder for your project, create a new folder called css
11:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> and in there place a file called custom.css
11:10 < Yam`:#liferay> I don't plan on developping a very different theme than the classic
11:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> oh
11:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> in that case one sec
11:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> in eclipse
11:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> open the build.xml for the theme project
11:12 < Yam`:#liferay> done
11:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> change the theme.parent property to classic
11:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> redeploy the theme
11:13 < Yam`:#liferay> redeploying
11:13 < jardineworks:#liferay> then refresh your page
11:14 < jardineworks:#liferay> you still want to do the other steps though... create a css folder inside _diffs and then create a file with your custom styles in there called custom.css
11:14 < Yam`:#liferay> ok thanks :) but I want the classic color scheme and not the dark one, how can I change that?
11:14 < jardineworks:#liferay> if you look into the css folder (at the same level as _diffs) you'll find a main.css file... in there you can see that the custom.css is loaded last.
11:15 < Yam`:#liferay> yes I've done that for another theme that crashed (css folder with custom css)
11:16 < jardineworks:#liferay> the darker is the colour scheme I think
11:17 < jardineworks:#liferay> you will have to place that inside the theme definition in the look-and-feel.xml
11:19 < jardineworks:#liferay> Yam`, Like this --
11:19 < jardineworks:#liferay> <look-and-feel>
11:19 < jardineworks:#liferay> 	<compatibility>
11:19 < jardineworks:#liferay> 		<version>6.2.10+</version>
11:19 < jardineworks:#liferay> 	</compatibility>
11:19 < jardineworks:#liferay> 	<theme id="Sample-project" name="Sample Theme">
11:19 < jardineworks:#liferay> 		<color-scheme id="02" name="Dark">
11:19 < jardineworks:#liferay> 			<css-class>dark</css-class>
11:19 < jardineworks:#liferay> 		</color-scheme>
11:19 < jardineworks:#liferay> 	</theme>
11:19 < jardineworks:#liferay> </look-and-feel>
11:19 < Yam`:#liferay> jardineworks, in liferay-portal(...)/tomcat(...)/webapps/ROOT/WEB-INF ?
11:19 < jardineworks:#liferay> Yam`, nope.. .it is in your project.
11:19 < jardineworks:#liferay> expand the WEB-INF folder
11:19 < jardineworks:#liferay> so yes I guess... lol
11:20 < Yam`:#liferay> Ok my bad
11:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> but you want to change it in your project, not in the deployment
11:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> there should be a liferay-look-and-feel.xml
11:20 < Yam`:#liferay> yes
11:22 < Yam`:#liferay> I want the default theme, is the css-class "default" ?
11:23 < Yam`:#liferay> ok it works, thanks jardineworks :)
11:27 < jardineworks:#liferay> no problemo.. isn't Liferay awesome :)
11:29 < Yam`:#liferay> haha :D
11:29 < Yam`:#liferay> jardineworks, do you know if I can do something like that in liferay: http://i.glrd.fr/03_demandes.png
11:30 < Yam`:#liferay> like a submenu with other links
11:30 < Yam`:#liferay> subpages of a page
11:30 < Yam`:#liferay> here, "'Accueil", "Demandes" etc. would
11:30 < Yam`:#liferay> be the subpages
11:30 < Yam`:#liferay> (and links)
11:31 < jardineworks:#liferay> those are breadcrumbs I think
12:13 < Yam`:#liferay> jardineworks, for the media and documents portlet, where do I put my documents to be displayed ?

16:18 < jardineworks:#liferay> any chance you are around rotty3000 ?
17:15 <@rotty3000:#liferay> hey jardineworks, sort of... ;)
17:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> rotty3000, I have to go grab my son :( ... but I have a fairly complicated question to ask you. Do you think you might be around tomorrow?
17:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> rotty3000, has to do with sharding and instances and database restores and tigers and bear oh my!
17:22 < jardineworks:#liferay> maybe a quartz scheduler in a clustered environment question if you have time :)
17:23 <@rotty3000:#liferay> hmm, sharding isn't my thing, but I'll be around tomorrow
18:18 < jardineworks:#liferay> rotty3000, if you are still there. I have some code that creates scheduled jobs on the fly. Basically it overrides the CheckArticle listener and provides the user the ability to create a precision expiration job when they create a piece of content.
18:19 < jardineworks:#liferay> rotty3000, I have this strange scenario where, in a cluster, sometimes it looks like jobs are being skipped. In a single node cluster or in a single stand alone server, the issue does not manifest itself.
18:19 < jardineworks:#liferay> rotty3000, and worse, I can't figure out the pattern for the failure.
18:19 < jardineworks:#liferay> rotty3000, do you know what class is used as the poller that invokes the triggers so that the jobs run?
18:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> (liferay 6.1)
18:23 < jardineworks:#liferay> (*6.1.1 to be precise)
