09:52 < dawn:#liferay> hi bijoo, u there
10:08 < bijoo_:#liferay> dawn: so sorry, was completely bogged last night.
10:17 < dawn:#liferay> bijoo_: no worries..let me know if you find any solution
10:27 < npskirk:#liferay> hey, question about 6.2 CE….
10:28 < npskirk:#liferay> My understanding is you shifted over to using Twitter bootstrap for the front end, themes, etc
10:29 < npskirk:#liferay> does this mean the YUI client and AlloyUI is gone from all the existing portlets?
11:49 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey bijoo have you built any portlet struts action hooks using 6.2 + Maven?
11:52 < jardineworks:#liferay> anyone else in here also?
11:53 < jardineworks:#liferay> for some reason, I can't seem to get my struts portlet action to override.
11:53 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik, any chance you can make my friday? lol
12:38 < jardineworks:#liferay> https://www.liferay.com/community/forums/-/message_boards/message/41191499 in case anyone can help
12:49 < jardineworks:#liferay> nevermind... I had the wrong struts mapping.
15:32 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: :) glad you got struts action to work; shouldn't matter to do with the maven; so long as the WAR file's package proper.
15:40 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo_, yeah i know -- I was grasping :). I just don't like Maven so I am always looking for a reason to give it a black eye ;)
15:47 < bijoo_:#liferay> dawn: I just did it and it worked fine here
15:47 < bijoo_:#liferay> I'll share you the project files so you see
15:48 < bijoo_:#liferay> dawn: reference to original ticket: https://issues.liferay.com/browse/IDE-376
15:48 < dawn:#liferay> bijoo_: sure
15:49 < bijoo_:#liferay> dawn: https://t.seebgroup.com/social-network-portlet.zip
15:52 < bijoo_:#liferay> dawn: fyi, file altered was jsp: docroot/wall/view.jsp
15:53 < dawn:#liferay> bijoo_: i thought we should have only modified files under docroot/
15:54 < bijoo_:#liferay> dawn: right, I unzipped the whole war in docroot; but shouldn't need to unzip the whole thing.
15:55 < bijoo_:#liferay> dawn: "ant merge" copies docroot to tmp folder.
15:55 < bijoo_:#liferay> npskirk: no, alloyui is more than just styles; bootstrap provides for the standard styling.
16:02 < dawn:#liferay> bijoo_: check this once...http://expirebox.com/download/dac0d3e941fb01652f7974e691665c24.html
16:03 < dawn:#liferay> bijoo_: do I need to carry over original liferay-plugin-package.properties and other metadata files as well from social portlet?
16:04 < bijoo_:#liferay> dawn: only if you want to modify them
16:06 < bijoo_:#liferay> dawn: it worked well; I don't see issue with war.
16:06 < dawn:#liferay> bijoo_: that is my dilemma..
16:06 < dawn:#liferay> in my environment it builds with name my-social-networking-portlet-6.2.10.${plugin.version}.war
16:07 < bijoo_:#liferay> dawn:       [zip] Building zip: /opt/lr/62ga2/lr2014appcontest/liferay-plugins-sdk-6.2/dist/my-social-networking-portlet-6.2.0.1.war
16:07 < bijoo_:#liferay> dawn: maybe something matter with SDK
16:07 < dawn:#liferay> bijoo_: weird..it couldn't find module-incremental-version field defined in plugin-package file..
16:07 < bijoo_:#liferay> dawn: is it a clean download of SDK?
16:08 < dawn:#liferay> yeah..sdk of 6.2 SP5
16:08 < dawn:#liferay> got it last week
16:08 < bijoo_:#liferay> dawn: want to try the GA2 CE one?
16:08 < bijoo_:#liferay> dawn: that's the one I'm using on my local
16:09 < dawn:#liferay> bijoo_: sure will give it a shot
16:09 < bijoo_:#liferay> dawn: nothing wrong with project; environment
16:22 < dawn:#liferay> bijoo_: you are right...something must be wrong in my sdk. it worked with CE GA2 sdk
16:26 < bijoo_:#liferay> dawn: since you have support, can open ticket; create and LPE if you want to?
16:26 < bijoo_:#liferay> create an* LPE if you want to
16:27 < dawn:#liferay> bijoo_: sure
16:40 < dawn:#liferay> bijoo_: I even tried with SP6 EE SDK, samething happens. Looks like an issue with EE sdk..
17:18 < bijoo_:#liferay> dawn: very well could be since not well-known thing
20:41 < bunbury:#liferay> evening all
21:56 < bijoo_:#liferay> bunbury: evening, how is it going here?
21:56 < bunbury:#liferay> hi bijoo_ - its ok
