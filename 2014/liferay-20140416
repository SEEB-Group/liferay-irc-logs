07:13 < modd_> I'm look for some overview page of LR and JSRs. especially I'm looking for JSR 333
07:14 < modd_> or at least jsr 283
08:36 < jardineworks> modd_, https://www.liferay.com/products/liferay-portal/tech-specs -- do a find in the page for "Standards"
08:37 < modd_> i know this page. jsr170 is listed, but the rest not
08:37 < modd_> a list of compatible browsers is also missing on this page
08:38 < jardineworks> good point
08:38 < jardineworks> modd_, sorry, so you just want to know whether or not Liferay is compliant with 333 and 283?
08:39 < modd_> yep
08:39 < jardineworks> what is the difference between 170, 283 and 333... they all seem to refeenrece the same thing "Content repository"
08:40 < jardineworks> just newer versions?
08:41 < modd_> I guess so
08:41 < modd_> but there must be a reason, why just 170 is listed
08:41 < jardineworks> I know that Jackrabbit is supposed to be one of the few fully compliant repos .. and Liferay supports Jackrabbit... so maybe by extrapolation, Liferay supports JSR 333? :)
08:41 < jardineworks> could just be out of date content
08:41 < jardineworks> (no pun intended :) )
08:42 < modd_> hmm
08:43 < modd_> well, I guess it's the way lr does documentation^^
08:43 < jardineworks> modd_, why do you ask? is it a requirement for your project? or pitch?
08:45 < modd_> I was asked if lr supports jsr333
08:45 < modd_> so I thought "let's make a quick google search"
08:45 < modd_> and here we are^^
08:46 < jardineworks> :)
08:46 < jardineworks> fair enough
12:11 < jardineworks> hey rotty3000 -- any chance you are around for a 10 - 15 min conversation?
12:11 < jardineworks> about search stuff.
12:17 < modd> please say semantic search :D
