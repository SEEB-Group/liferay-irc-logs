08:08 < ferrema:#liferay> hi all
08:09 < ferrema:#liferay> i'm having a problem migrating a liferay 6.0.6 to 6.1.x
08:09 < ferrema:#liferay> namely
08:09 < ferrema:#liferay> it looks like there are some images missing for the image gallery
08:09 < ferrema:#liferay> and that's causing the migration to stop
08:10 < ferrema:#liferay> com.liferay.portlet.documentlibrary.NoSuchFileException: /home/ferrema/devel/migration/liferay-portal-6.1.2/data/document_library/0/0/11/95/119551.png/119551_1.0.png
08:10 < ferrema:#liferay> ...
08:10 < ferrema:#liferay> [more images missing]
08:10 < ferrema:#liferay> Stopping the server due to unexpected startup errors
08:10 < ferrema:#liferay> any idea on how to circumvent this ?
08:41 < Axxell:#liferay> hey guys, how do i get the latest file version of a file that is in the form of an assetentry
09:08 < modd_:#liferay> hi topolik: do you mind to have a look at this: https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/blob/master/portal-impl/src/com/liferay/portlet/expando/service/impl/ExpandoValueLocalServiceImpl.java?source=cc#L542 - I guess STRING_LOCALIZED is missing. I'm getting a string cannot convert to map
09:14 < modd_:#liferay> maybe it's a question for rotty3000, seems like he did write this class^^
09:21 < modd_:#liferay> STRING_ARRAY_LOCALIZED is missing, too
10:39 < topolik:#liferay> Hi modd_
10:39 < topolik:#liferay> I don't understand
10:41 < topolik:#liferay> looking at the code, STRING_LOCALIZED is not specified => liferay tries to cast the argument to Map<Locale, ?>, which should be a map with localized strings
10:44 < modd_:#liferay> the content of that field is something like {en_GB=foo;ja_JP=bar}
10:45 < modd_:#liferay> but it throws this error
10:45 < modd_:#liferay> we've solved it for now by adding that file to and ext and implementing it by ourself
10:54 < gok_:#liferay> hi channel for alloyui?
12:25 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey topolik... if I share a stacktrace with you, can you help me try to figure out the root cause?
12:25 < jardineworks:#liferay> I can't seem to find the problem
12:25 < jardineworks:#liferay> something inside Liferay is mad at me :)
12:55 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey rotty3000 -- are you around? I am looking at code with your name on it and have a security question if you are :)

15:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> anyone around for a stupid java question. Stupid as in I should be able to do this myself but I am stuck for some reason
15:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> I need a rubber duck.
15:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf! \o/
15:06 <@jhf:#liferay> hey :)
15:06 <@jhf:#liferay> in california this week so a bit disconnected
15:06 <@jhf:#liferay> let's hear your dumb question!
15:08 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, california! lucky bastard... its been -30 degrees celcius 3 days in a row here!
15:08 <@jhf:#liferay> hahaha
15:08 <@jhf:#liferay> well it's snow-mageddon in Atlanta
15:08 <@jhf:#liferay> dang global warming
15:08 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, ok.. I have a jsp override for the navigation.jsp ... and it adds login options for twitter and google.
15:08 <@jhf:#liferay> k
15:08 < jardineworks:#liferay> for both I am using the scribe API
15:08 <@jhf:#liferay> you mean navigation.vm ?
15:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> no -- the one in the login portlet
15:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> the one that has facebook, etc.
15:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> I override and added a few more
15:09 <@jhf:#liferay> ahh
15:09 <@jhf:#liferay> ok
15:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> I have a scriptlet that tries to get a request token from tiwtter
15:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> I use the scribe api for this
15:10 <@jhf:#liferay> ok
15:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> everything was woking fine untul jan 14 when stupid twitter made https mandatory
15:10 <@jhf:#liferay> do
15:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> so.. looking at the scribe api...
15:10 <@jhf:#liferay> doh
15:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> TwitterApi.class has a static inner class called Authenticate -- that version uses https
15:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> soooooooo..
15:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> OAuthService service = new ServiceBuilder().provider(TwitterApi.class).....
15:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> becomes
15:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> OAuthService service = new ServiceBuilder().provider(TwitterApi.Authenticate.class)......
15:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> BUT
15:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> the jsp is telling me -- "TwitterApi.Authenticate cannot be resolved to a type
15:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> "
15:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> so I tried -- <%@ page import="org.scribe.builder.api.TwitterApi.Authenticate" %>
15:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> but that gives me a different error!
15:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> clearly I am doing something, or not doing something wrong.
15:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> but I can't figure out what it is... feels like chicken and egg
15:13 < jardineworks:#liferay> the other error (the import one) is "The import org.scribe.builder.api.TwitterApi.Authenticate cannot be resolved
15:13 < jardineworks:#liferay> "
15:13 < jardineworks:#liferay> but The import org.scribe.builder.api.TwitterApi does resolve :S
15:13 <@jhf:#liferay> hmmm
15:14 <@jhf:#liferay> as usual, I will have to do some googling because I can't ever remember the proper syntax for referring to this stuff
15:14 <@jhf:#liferay> perhaps its supported in the VM but not in the jsp compiler.. hmm.
15:15 <@jhf:#liferay> where is the javadoc for the Scribe API you're calling?
15:15 < jardineworks:#liferay> one sec
15:15 < jardineworks:#liferay> https://github.com/fernandezpablo85/scribe-java
15:21 <@jhf:#liferay> hmm
15:21 <@jhf:#liferay> can you try new TwitterApi.Authenticate().getClass() (instead of ".class")
15:22 <@jhf:#liferay> not sure why your original doesn't work, it seems right to me
15:23 <@jhf:#liferay> or possibly Class.forName("org.scribe.builder.api.TwitterApi.Authenticate")
15:23 < jardineworks:#liferay> k -- just rebooting... but I'll try those.
15:23 <@jhf:#liferay> k
15:23 < jardineworks:#liferay> why it can't resolve the type though, when it is in the same package, doesn't make sense to me
15:24 <@jhf:#liferay> me neither!
15:29 < jardineworks:#liferay> @#!%
15:29 <@jhf:#liferay> also is the class on the class path from the calling code's perspective? :)
15:31 < jardineworks:#liferay> well, it is inside the TwitterApi.class which does not have any complaints.
15:31 < jardineworks:#liferay> just to be sure I moved the scribe.jar into TOMCAT/lib/ext
15:34 < jardineworks:#liferay> "TwitterApi.Authenticate cannot be resolved to a type"
15:34 < jardineworks:#liferay> ultimately, I need to resolve the import --
15:37 < jardineworks:#liferay> hmm.. git history seems to show that it was updated in the last couple of days to make TwitterApi.class use SSL be default.
15:37 < jardineworks:#liferay> maybe new lib is the answer.
15:37 <@jhf:#liferay> yup I bet that'll do it too
15:37 <@jhf:#liferay> I think your issue is some jsp syntax thing
15:39 < jardineworks:#liferay> now to figure out where the hell to find the latest jar (assuming the update is in there)
15:49 < bradley:#liferay> does anyone know how to change page layout via a link in portal_normal.vm in velocity?
