16:54 < Naenyn:#liferay> rotty3000: would you happen to know who the best resource at Liferay would be to talk with about integrating Liferay with a proprietary CAS-based SSO system..?
16:55 < Naenyn:#liferay> best ^technical resource
16:56 <@rotty3000:#liferay> hmm
16:58 <@rotty3000:#liferay> .. I'm assuming you've taken all the front channels already?
16:59 < Naenyn:#liferay> Not yet. Just getting prepared for some upcoming work.
16:59 <@rotty3000:#liferay> looked at our current CAS impls.. etc.
17:00 < Naenyn:#liferay> I still need to do that. I've been focused on reading up on the proprietary system first.. then will switch to looking at how Liferay integrates with CAS and figuring out how to get these systems to play nice with eachother. =]
17:00 <@rotty3000:#liferay> yeah, we have quite a few SSO impls
17:01 <@rotty3000:#liferay> so it shouldn't be and overly complex exercise
17:01 < Naenyn:#liferay> I think the thing I'm most concerned with is how to associate users in the external system with users in the local liferay system.
17:02 <@rotty3000:#liferay> there are 3 known identifiers, and they are all reachable from our auth'n apis
17:02 <@rotty3000:#liferay> email, userId, screenName
17:02 <@rotty3000:#liferay> you have to choose which one most closely matches the external system
17:03 <@rotty3000:#liferay> userId: is a number, email: is .. an email address, screenName: is a string (limit charset)
17:04 < Naenyn:#liferay> Makes sense. That'd be email, in our case. Our Liferay instance currently exists on its own.. but once we add in the proprietary auth system, we'll need to update both Liferay and the external system appropriately with user information when the user logs in the first time..
17:05 <@rotty3000:#liferay> that should be pretty straight forward then
17:05 < Naenyn:#liferay> my SSO/auth skills are pretty weak. =|
17:05 <@rotty3000:#liferay> <same>
17:05 <@rotty3000:#liferay> my skilz there are not resplendant
17:07 < Naenyn:#liferay> Login hook functionality doesn't change when adding in an external SSO system to the mix, does it? User still gets auth'ed by external system, then liferay fires login hook(s)..?
17:07 <@rotty3000:#liferay> exactly
17:11 < Naenyn:#liferay> so it sounds like all I'd really need to do is pretend our external system is a CAS system and hook Liferay in to it as normal.. then code up some hooks for the extra stuff we need to do to handle the proprietary part.
17:20 <@rotty3000:#liferay> yes, that sounds right
17:20 <@rotty3000:#liferay> certainly what I would do
17:27 < Naenyn:#liferay> cool, thanks for discussing it with me. at some point I'll probably be back with more questions.. for now, off to reading more documentation. =]

21:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> Naenyn, I've done a pile of third party custom auth for Liferay so feel free to ask me any questions as well.
