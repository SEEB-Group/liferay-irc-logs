08:20 < modd_:#liferay> hey topolik, do you have a moment to check something for me? I'm curious if there's an 6.2 EE patch for this: https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/commit/e8ab55f3df0e5616698448f921be92072de9fcbc
08:26 < topolik:#liferay> hi modd_, yes
08:27 < topolik:#liferay> should be covered by these 2 fixpacks: 62-ee-sp4 or Â liferay-fixpack-platform-11-6210
08:27 < modd_:#liferay> ok, cool, thx! :)
08:28 < topolik:#liferay> n-p
08:28 < topolik:#liferay> n/p
09:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey topolik -- you still there?
09:26 < topolik:#liferay> hi jardineworks, how are you?
09:27 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik, awesome! how are you doing?
09:32 < topolik:#liferay> not bad :)
09:32 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik, getting ready for DevCon?
09:33 < topolik:#liferay> yup :)
09:33 < jardineworks:#liferay> I wish I could go this year ... if nothing else, I have never been to Germany :(
09:33 < jardineworks:#liferay> next year FOR SURE.
09:33 < jardineworks:#liferay> although my wife is pregnant... so she might like that idea hahaha
09:34 < jardineworks:#liferay> i do though!
09:34 < jardineworks:#liferay> ;)
09:34 < topolik:#liferay> whohoo, congrats!
09:34 < jardineworks:#liferay> \o/
09:34 < jardineworks:#liferay> but that's it man. 2 will be more than enough for me
09:35 < topolik:#liferay> unless you get twins... ;)
09:35 < jardineworks:#liferay> :O
09:35 < jardineworks:#liferay> TOPOLIK!
09:36 < jardineworks:#liferay> My buddy had twins for his first. That must be a nightmare. I remember how hard the first one was as a single -- mostly because you never really know what to do. But TWO?! TWO screaming kids? two sets of diapers, two sets of potty training... ugh
09:40 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik, I have a couple of questions for you actually.
09:40 < jardineworks:#liferay> 1. Do you know if the remote services are available for liferay.com? Meaning, could I pull details from my profile remotely
09:40 < jardineworks:#liferay> ?
09:41 < topolik:#liferay> 1. yes
09:41 < jardineworks:#liferay> awesome! so I could, for example, pull the number of forum posts I have?
09:42 < topolik:#liferay> probably, if there's the right service/method
09:42 < jardineworks:#liferay> nice
09:43 < jardineworks:#liferay> ok #2 -- more up your alley because its security related.
09:43 < jardineworks:#liferay> 2. I remember you telling me when I was on 6.1 that the Liferay.PortletURL javascript stuff was going to change in 6.2. If memory serves, the change was that the pauth would not be present
09:43 < jardineworks:#liferay> is that right?
09:44 < topolik:#liferay> p_p_auth, yes
09:44 < topolik:#liferay> p_auth also but it's available in window.Liferay.authToken
09:45 < topolik:#liferay> sorry, need to go AFK now, BBL
09:49 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik, if you have time later, ping me -- I have more questions!
09:49 < jardineworks:#liferay> :)
09:57 < topolik:#liferay> jardineworks: I'm back, let's continue
09:57 < jardineworks:#liferay> awesome
09:58 < jardineworks:#liferay> ok -- so I guess my question is, if I continue to use the Liferay.PortletURL js code, does that mean that my request might get rejected by the serve resource methods?
10:05 < topolik:#liferay> yes, in case the portlet is not on the page
10:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> ah I see
10:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> hmm.. but you are saying that I could possible grab the token from the window.Liferay.authToken and add it to the parameters?
10:41 < topolik:#liferay> jardineworks: sure, that's the purpose of it
10:41 < jardineworks:#liferay> ok cool -- thanks :)
10:42 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik, are you presenting at DevCon this year?
10:42 < topolik:#liferay> nope
10:42 < topolik:#liferay> I'm not a good presenter
10:42 < topolik:#liferay> I'm trying to avoid it at all costs ;)
10:42 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik, ?! I thought you did a pretty good job on that dev.life session :)
10:44 < topolik:#liferay> thanks friend ;)
21:53 < urug_:#liferay> Any straith forward way to get link to edit page of journal article in control panel with the knowledge of journal article ID??
21:54 < urug_:#liferay> Something like ConentUtil.getConentControlePanelEditLink() ...
22:03 < urug_:#liferay> maybe PortalUtil.getControlPanelFullURL(themeDisplay.getScopeGroupId(), PortletKeys.JOURNAL_CONTENT, portletParamsWithContentId) ...
22:53 < urug_:#liferay> lol ${request['theme-display']['url-portal']} is undefined according to log, yet it's printed with valid value.
22:56 < urug_:#liferay> unfortunatelly I can't suppress the error
