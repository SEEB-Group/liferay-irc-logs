09:16 < modd:#liferay> hey there. I could need some help. I have a portlet with a test.jsp. I want to get a render url to this jsp, however, it should be rendered in maximized state on a page, which normally does not contain the portlet
10:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey modd
10:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> modd, the portlet is on another page though?
10:15 < modd:#liferay> jardineworks: it is, but this page might be private while I have to allow guest access
10:16 < modd:#liferay> what I want is simply a url, which leads to the guest landing page but shows my portlet fullsized instead of the other content
10:16 < jardineworks:#liferay> modd, can you do a modal?
10:17 < modd:#liferay> well, it would be ok to render the page and show a popup, yes
