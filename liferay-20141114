09:16 < modd:#liferay> hey there. I could need some help. I have a portlet with a test.jsp. I want to get a render url to this jsp, however, it should be rendered in maximized state on a page, which normally does not contain the portlet
10:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey modd
10:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> modd, the portlet is on another page though?
10:15 < modd:#liferay> jardineworks: it is, but this page might be private while I have to allow guest access
10:16 < modd:#liferay> what I want is simply a url, which leads to the guest landing page but shows my portlet fullsized instead of the other content
10:16 < jardineworks:#liferay> modd, can you do a modal?
10:17 < modd:#liferay> well, it would be ok to render the page and show a popup, yes
10:17 < jardineworks:#liferay> or ... in the layout template put a check for the guest user and embed your test portlet if the user is not logged in?
10:18 < modd:#liferay> no, I cannot have any changes to the template or theme
10:18 < modd:#liferay> I thought about a hidden page with another instance, but I don't really like this idea
10:18 < jardineworks:#liferay> modd, no -- that seems a little gross.
10:18 < jardineworks:#liferay> :)
10:19 < modd:#liferay> I can't think of a good solution...
10:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> modd, I am drawing a picture. So you have Page A with a TestPortlet on it. You have Page B with a whole bunch of other portlets. If a user who is default (anonymous) goes to Page B, then you want to instead show them the content from your TestPortlet.
10:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> is that it?
10:20 < modd:#liferay> not exactly
10:20 < modd:#liferay> I have my guest site with a "home" page
10:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> great -- now my drawing is no good :)
10:21 < modd:#liferay> and I have another page with the portlet on a private page/site/whatever
10:21 < modd:#liferay> in this portlet I create a random parameter string and this portlet has also a servlet filter hook
10:23 < modd:#liferay> now in my servlet filter, I want to get a URL to the home page, where the portlet will render a special_view.jsp and gets the random parameter string as parameter so it can show/do things with it
10:24 < jardineworks:#liferay> and the "test portlet" is on the private page?
10:24 < modd:#liferay> yep
10:26 < modd:#liferay> I think I have to create an invisible portlet on the "home" page to render a modal :\
10:27 < modd:#liferay> or somehow render the portlet without any page
10:27 < jardineworks:#liferay> so -- when the user goes to the "guest homepage" ... they should see the Test Portlet content. Everything? or only in certain scenarios?
10:28 < jardineworks:#liferay> there was someone in the forum a few weeks back asking about getting the render content for another portlet as part of a serveResource call.
