09:16 < modd:#liferay> hey there. I could need some help. I have a portlet with a test.jsp. I want to get a render url to this jsp, however, it should be rendered in maximized state on a page, which normally does not contain the portlet
10:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey modd
10:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> modd, the portlet is on another page though?
10:15 < modd:#liferay> jardineworks: it is, but this page might be private while I have to allow guest access
10:16 < modd:#liferay> what I want is simply a url, which leads to the guest landing page but shows my portlet fullsized instead of the other content
10:16 < jardineworks:#liferay> modd, can you do a modal?
10:17 < modd:#liferay> well, it would be ok to render the page and show a popup, yes
10:17 < jardineworks:#liferay> or ... in the layout template put a check for the guest user and embed your test portlet if the user is not logged in?
10:18 < modd:#liferay> no, I cannot have any changes to the template or theme
10:18 < modd:#liferay> I thought about a hidden page with another instance, but I don't really like this idea
10:18 < jardineworks:#liferay> modd, no -- that seems a little gross.
10:18 < jardineworks:#liferay> :)
10:19 < modd:#liferay> I can't think of a good solution...
10:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> modd, I am drawing a picture. So you have Page A with a TestPortlet on it. You have Page B with a whole bunch of other portlets. If a user who is default (anonymous) goes to Page B, then you want to instead show them the content from your TestPortlet.
10:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> is that it?
10:20 < modd:#liferay> not exactly
10:20 < modd:#liferay> I have my guest site with a "home" page
10:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> great -- now my drawing is no good :)
10:21 < modd:#liferay> and I have another page with the portlet on a private page/site/whatever
10:21 < modd:#liferay> in this portlet I create a random parameter string and this portlet has also a servlet filter hook
10:23 < modd:#liferay> now in my servlet filter, I want to get a URL to the home page, where the portlet will render a special_view.jsp and gets the random parameter string as parameter so it can show/do things with it
10:24 < jardineworks:#liferay> and the "test portlet" is on the private page?
10:24 < modd:#liferay> yep
10:26 < modd:#liferay> I think I have to create an invisible portlet on the "home" page to render a modal :\
10:27 < modd:#liferay> or somehow render the portlet without any page
10:27 < jardineworks:#liferay> so -- when the user goes to the "guest homepage" ... they should see the Test Portlet content. Everything? or only in certain scenarios?
10:28 < jardineworks:#liferay> there was someone in the forum a few weeks back asking about getting the render content for another portlet as part of a serveResource call.
10:28 < jardineworks:#liferay> I think he was getting the HTML, returning it to the page (via ajax call) and then updating the DOM.
10:29 < jardineworks:#liferay> do you have control over the portlets that appear on the homepage?
10:29 < modd:#liferay> rendering parts or whole other portlets by ajax isn't very hard
10:29 < modd:#liferay> but in this case I don't have a portlet, which will do this rendering
10:30 < modd:#liferay> I have control, but I really don't want to add new portlets to the "home" page
10:31 < jardineworks:#liferay> is there a condition where this information would not be shown on the homepage?
10:32 < modd:#liferay> if I directly browse to the home page, nothing will render
10:32 < modd:#liferay> well, except of the normal page + portlets of course
10:33 < jardineworks:#liferay> ok -- so what about a service post hook, that will grab the content from the test portlet and place it into the request? and then on the homepage ... oh wait, you don't want to change anything on the homepage.
10:33 < jardineworks:#liferay> poop.
10:33 < modd:#liferay> the best solution is to completely ignore the home page
10:34 < modd:#liferay> like having the portal frame and only the portlet in this frame instead of any whole page
10:34 < jardineworks:#liferay> but something on the homepage has to detect whether or not to render the test portlet info right? so in that case, is it possible to completely ignore the homepage?
10:35 < modd:#liferay> I can build the url the way I want
10:35 < modd:#liferay> user gets this: host/myportlet/foobar
10:35 < modd:#liferay> the servlet filter will then use myportlet and foobar to render the portlet
10:36 < jardineworks:#liferay> I see... or host/yourportlet/anotherbar
10:36 < modd:#liferay> but how to load the portal frame without having it load a page
10:36 < modd:#liferay> yes
10:36 < jardineworks:#liferay> can you create a page on the fly? :)
10:36 < modd:#liferay> well, yes, but it's a bad solution ;P
10:36 < jardineworks:#liferay> Create a layout, but don't save it to the database?
10:36 < jardineworks:#liferay> haha
10:37 < jardineworks:#liferay> doesn't see that bad to me :)
10:37 < modd:#liferay> hmm, I don't think it's possible
10:37 < modd:#liferay> if it's not stored to DB how will liferay find it to render it
10:37 < modd:#liferay> an unpersistent layout object will be unknown for the portal
10:37 < jardineworks:#liferay> I've never tried... but there is nothing stopping you from creating a layout model, setting all the attribtues and passing it around. I mean, the LayoutServiceLocalUtil.get ... just returns to you a Layout right?
10:38 < jardineworks:#liferay> but you just need the layout for that request?
10:39 < modd:#liferay> creating a portletURL will need a plid. I can create a layout and pass it's plid, but as it's never persisted, the portal cannot find that layout later
10:39 < jardineworks:#liferay> you don't need it forever right? so if I send in .. /host/portletA/pageA ... this time, then I get back a 1 column layout with my portletA on it. Next time I ask for /host/portetB/pageB ...
10:39 < jardineworks:#liferay> hmm
10:39 < jardineworks:#liferay> good point
10:39 < jardineworks:#liferay> I didn't think you needed it again later though
10:39 < jardineworks:#liferay> I don't think I am fully up to speed :) ... can you show me a demo?
10:39 < modd:#liferay> I don't have to, but the portal has to
10:40 < jardineworks:#liferay> ok
10:40 < jardineworks:#liferay> what if
10:40 < modd:#liferay> hmm..it's somehow like the login portlet. if I'm a guest and try to use a url to access the control panel, I get redirected to the guest default page and see the login portlet fullsized, eventhoug it's not on that page
10:41 < jardineworks:#liferay> you got whatever layout was specified, and then on the fly in your filter changed the portlets on it?
10:41 < modd:#liferay> that's even worse^^
10:41 < jardineworks:#liferay> haha
10:41 < modd:#liferay> what if someone else renders the page the same moment
10:41 < jardineworks:#liferay> but you wouldn't SAVE the changed portlets...
10:42 < modd:#liferay> hmm
10:42 < modd:#liferay> I'm not sure, if this is possible at all^^
10:42 < jardineworks:#liferay> so the Layout as it is stored in the database still has portlet a,b,c .. but for your user, he has asked for (say the homepage) you have detected soemthing, so the one you give back to him removes those portlets and ... or even just ADDS the test portlet in full screen
10:42 < jardineworks:#liferay> neither am I
10:42 < jardineworks:#liferay> haha I'm just throwing out ideas
10:43 < jardineworks:#liferay> but your login example...
10:43 < jardineworks:#liferay> when you try to access the control panel, and you are not logged in, you are redirected to /c/portal/login
10:43 < jardineworks:#liferay> right?
10:43 < modd:#liferay> the problem is simply "when". If I change it before redirecting, I can only pass the plid and nothing happens
10:44 < jardineworks:#liferay> and that struts action returns the login portlet maximized.
