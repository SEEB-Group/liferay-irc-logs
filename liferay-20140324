16:54 < Naenyn:#liferay> rotty3000: would you happen to know who the best resource at Liferay would be to talk with about integrating Liferay with a proprietary CAS-based SSO system..?
16:55 < Naenyn:#liferay> best ^technical resource
16:56 <@rotty3000:#liferay> hmm
16:58 <@rotty3000:#liferay> .. I'm assuming you've taken all the front channels already?
16:59 < Naenyn:#liferay> Not yet. Just getting prepared for some upcoming work.
16:59 <@rotty3000:#liferay> looked at our current CAS impls.. etc.
17:00 < Naenyn:#liferay> I still need to do that. I've been focused on reading up on the proprietary system first.. then will switch to looking at how Liferay integrates with CAS and figuring out how to get these systems to play nice with eachother. =]
17:00 <@rotty3000:#liferay> yeah, we have quite a few SSO impls
