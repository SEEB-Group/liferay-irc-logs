05:30 < Axxell:#liferay> hmm testing to upgrade from liferay 6.2 GA1-GA2 and ive got this problem: the assetpublisher which worked on GA1 with an display template gets the following error: entry.getAssetRenderer() is undefined. It cannot be assigned to assetRenderer..  i wonder what the problem might be?
