08:54 < Yam`:#liferay> yo !
09:10 < Yam`:#liferay> is there a way to make en entire search container row clickable, that leads to process action in the java main class?
09:11 < Yam`:#liferay> I've found how to make a cell clickable (search-container-column-text) but I would like the whole row to be clickable
09:18 < jardineworks_:#liferay> Yam`, what happens if you wrap the <search-container:row/> tag with an <div/> tag and then give that div a click event?
09:19 < Yam`:#liferay> jardineworks_, how do I define a click event in jsp that links to my process action
09:19 < Yam`:#liferay> ?*
09:20 < jardineworks_:#liferay> hmm
09:20 < jardineworks_:#liferay> well, using javascript you can register a callback when the div is clicked.
09:20 < jardineworks_:#liferay> Then in that JS you could probably use alloy ui to create an action
09:20 < Yam`:#liferay> I can call the java process action with JS?
09:22 < jardineworks_:#liferay> Yam`, sure -- if you look at what a <portlet:actionURL/> produces, it's just a url :)
09:23 < jardineworks_:#liferay> In fact, you could even create a <portlet:actioURL/> and then pass it as an argument to the JS call and then just call it -- that way you don't have to build it in the JS.
09:24 < Yam`:#liferay> mhh, how do I link the div and the portlet action ?
09:25 < jardineworks_:#liferay> Yam`, well, first, google for a tutorial on how to register a click event for a div (if you don't already know how to do that)... and then try it and make sure it works (just do an alert("made it!"); or something for your callback)
09:25 < jardineworks_:#liferay> then create the actionURL as a next step and make sure it looks right
09:25 < jardineworks_:#liferay> hmmm
09:26 < jardineworks_:#liferay> wait, registered callbacks are implicitly called so I guess you can't pass the argument. I think you will have to build the URL in the JS
09:28 < Yam`:#liferay> "then create the actionURL as a next step and make sure it looks right" that's that that I don't know how to do
09:45 < jardineworks_:#liferay> Yam`, which version of LR are you on again?
09:46 < Yam`:#liferay> 6.2 CE
09:47 < jardineworks_:#liferay> https://www.liferay.com/documentation/liferay-portal/6.2/development/-/ai/creating-portlet-urls-in-javascript-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-07-en
09:47 < jardineworks_:#liferay> Yam`, the way you do it between 6.1 and 6.2 changed ... so make sure you give that page a good read. I can see references to both.
09:48 < Yam`:#liferay> thanks jardineworks_
