08:54 < Yam`:#liferay> yo !
09:10 < Yam`:#liferay> is there a way to make en entire search container row clickable, that leads to process action in the java main class?
09:11 < Yam`:#liferay> I've found how to make a cell clickable (search-container-column-text) but I would like the whole row to be clickable
09:18 < jardineworks_:#liferay> Yam`, what happens if you wrap the <search-container:row/> tag with an <div/> tag and then give that div a click event?
