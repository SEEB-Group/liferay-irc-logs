04:04 < goku_:#liferay> hi ,is there any way to change the liferay search container pager style ,i need to show icons instead of "next" and "previous" text ,how to do that?
04:40 < winem_:#liferay> good morning, we still have the same issue as yesterday. we try to update lar-archives over the web-gui and get instant an error "aborted". there is nothing written to the log files. anyone an idea why this happens?
05:34 < winem_:#liferay> we are able to reproduce this behaviour on 3 servers with centos or windows and jboss wildfly as application server and JDK 7u45
05:49 < winem_:#liferay> got it, it's fixed with the latest GA which is available since june
08:14 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> hi there
08:14 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> I'm looking for a workaround of this bug : https://issues.liferay.com/browse/LPS-44153 (not able to save layout template on a page if current layout set is not deployed in liferay)
