04:04 < goku_:#liferay> hi ,is there any way to change the liferay search container pager style ,i need to show icons instead of "next" and "previous" text ,how to do that?
04:40 < winem_:#liferay> good morning, we still have the same issue as yesterday. we try to update lar-archives over the web-gui and get instant an error "aborted". there is nothing written to the log files. anyone an idea why this happens?
05:34 < winem_:#liferay> we are able to reproduce this behaviour on 3 servers with centos or windows and jboss wildfly as application server and JDK 7u45
05:49 < winem_:#liferay> got it, it's fixed with the latest GA which is available since june
08:14 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> hi there
08:14 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> I'm looking for a workaround of this bug : https://issues.liferay.com/browse/LPS-44153 (not able to save layout template on a page if current layout set is not deployed in liferay)
08:15 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> we're on 6.1.2 CE and this bug only seems to be corrected on 6.1.x EE and 6.2 EE
08:20 < modd_:#liferay> check out the diff: https://github.com/lipusz/liferay-portal/commit/4e5c5d138cfc2b9c097c3b6a8ab16a0fd19ae541
09:24 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> modd_ thanks, but it seems the LayoutTypePortletImpl class I have (6.1.2 CE) is different from the one in the GIT.
09:33 < Yam`:#liferay> hey
09:33 < Yam`:#liferay> are you there jardineworks_?
09:44 < jardineworks_:#liferay> Yam`, I am now
09:44 < jardineworks_:#liferay> what's up
09:45 < Yam`:#liferay> hey :D
09:45 < Yam`:#liferay> I have an object I retrieved from my database
09:45 < Yam`:#liferay> And I want to display the values in my jsp
09:45 < jardineworks_:#liferay> ok
09:45 < Yam`:#liferay> Like <p>Name</p> <% valueFromDatabase.name %>
09:46 < Yam`:#liferay> Do you know if there's a simple way to do it?
09:46 < jardineworks_:#liferay> did you retrieve it in the portlet class?
09:46 < Yam`:#liferay> yes
09:46 < jardineworks_:#liferay> in the render method?
09:46 < jardineworks_:#liferay> (assuming you are using an MVC Portlet)
09:46 < Yam`:#liferay> I've already done the renderRequest.setAttribute
09:46 < jardineworks_:#liferay> ok
09:46 < Yam`:#liferay> Like that : renderRequest.setAttribute(Constants.ATTRIBUTE_ACCESS_REQUEST_DETAILS.toString(), iteratorURL);
09:47 < jardineworks_:#liferay> what is the value of ATTRIBUTE_ACCESS_REQUEST_DETAILS?
09:47 < Yam`:#liferay> It's a string
09:56 < jardineworks_:#liferay> if its a string you don't need toString().
09:56 < jardineworks_:#liferay> but what's that actual assigned value?
09:57 < Yam`:#liferay> there's no value it's an enum
09:57 < Yam`:#liferay> hence the toString
09:58 < Yam`:#liferay> so proud of saying hence professionally
10:14 < jardineworks_:#liferay> Yam`, even with an enum, when you use it, there is a value right? the way the setAttribute works is you give it a string (which representing the key) and the value (under which the key is store). ... so If I say setAttribute(" jardineworks", Company ); then in my JSP I can access it as ${ jardineworks.companyName } ... provided that the Company object has a getCompanyName() method.
10:15 < Yam`:#liferay> Ok I see, I'll try that thanks jardineworks_
10:17 < Yam`:#liferay> jardineworks_, can I do ${foo} without a c:out to display it?
10:19 < jardineworks_:#liferay> {$foo} will output the objects toString() which if you haven't overrided probably isn't very useful. Better to do ${foo.<getmethod>}
10:29 < Yam`:#liferay> thanks jardineworks_ it works as expected :)
10:29 < jardineworks_:#liferay> np
10:36 < Yam`:#liferay> jardineworks_, what would be the best way to change the content of a portlet depending of a variable?
10:36 < Yam`:#liferay> for example, if "requestAccessId" is null, I display an error message in the porlet such as "Please select a request access" and if it is not I display the details of the request
10:44 < jardineworks_:#liferay> <c:choose><c:when test='${ is empty requestAccessId }'><div> Please...</div></c:when><c:otherwise> // other stuff here </c:otherwise>
10:44 < jardineworks_:#liferay> Yam`, ^^
10:59 < jardineworks_:#liferay> Yam`, you get my last message?
11:00 < Yam`:#liferay> nope, Internet connexion issues
11:00 < jardineworks_:#liferay> <c:choose><c:when test='${ is empty requestAccessId }'><div> Please...</div></c:when><c:otherwise> // other stuff here </c:otherwise>
