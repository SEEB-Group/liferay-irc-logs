08:21 < modd_:#liferay> hi topolik (or topolik1^^): do you know if vaadin will be updated in liferay and/or the liferay ide?
08:23 < topolik1:#liferay> hi modd_ :) I'm sorry, Vaadin is completely out of my sight
08:23 < modd_:#liferay> ohh :(
08:24 < topolik1:#liferay> but feel free to ping Greg
09:13 < jardineworks_:#liferay> topolik1, any thoughts on why an auto.login.hook might now be firing? In fact any of them for that matter. I've tried configuring not just my custome one by OpenSSO, SiteMinder, etc. In every case the only breakpoint that gets hit is in the LoginAction class (after I manually type in my username and password)
