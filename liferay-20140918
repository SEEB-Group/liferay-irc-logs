08:21 < modd_:#liferay> hi topolik (or topolik1^^): do you know if vaadin will be updated in liferay and/or the liferay ide?
08:23 < topolik1:#liferay> hi modd_ :) I'm sorry, Vaadin is completely out of my sight
08:23 < modd_:#liferay> ohh :(
08:24 < topolik1:#liferay> but feel free to ping Greg
09:13 < jardineworks_:#liferay> topolik1, any thoughts on why an auto.login.hook might now be firing? In fact any of them for that matter. I've tried configuring not just my custome one by OpenSSO, SiteMinder, etc. In every case the only breakpoint that gets hit is in the LoginAction class (after I manually type in my username and password)
09:14 < jardineworks_:#liferay> ... actually before as well, on the way to be being redirected to the login page.
09:14 < jardineworks_:#liferay> modd_, I've never tried anything with Vaadin -- can I pick your brain on it?
09:21 < topolik1:#liferay> jardineworks_: AutoLoginFilter is mapped to several locations, for example /c/portal/login
09:21 < topolik1:#liferay> when you try this URL does the breakpoint hit?
09:26 < urug_:#liferay> I need to copy Liferay to another server. Can I just basically copy the whole tomcat+liferay bundle folder and export-import DB?
09:30 < jardineworks_:#liferay> hey topolik1 that is the one I was trying but the only breakpoint that is hit is the one in the LoginAction class. I have breakpoints set in several other classes though.
09:30 < jardineworks_:#liferay> it's so strange... I have never actually had a problem with this feature in the past. three steps, done ...
09:33 < topolik1:#liferay> hmm, can you put breakpoint into AutoLoginFilter?
09:36 < jardineworks_:#liferay> topolik1, I think i have one there... but let m edouble check
09:36 < jardineworks_:#liferay> I have one at line 152
09:36 < jardineworks_:#liferay> never gets hits
09:37 < jardineworks_:#liferay> which is why i think the auto login is not being invoked?
09:37 < jardineworks_:#liferay> but I have not overridden the  com.liferay.portal.servlet.filters.autologin.AutoLoginFilter from the portal.properties -- it is still set to true.
09:38 < topolik1:#liferay> hmm, then you need to stop inside InvokerFilterChain
09:39 < topolik1:#liferay> and see what filters are applied to the URL and look if/how they are applied
09:39 < jardineworks_:#liferay> topolik1, never done that before :)
09:39 < jardineworks_:#liferay> so line 72?
09:39 < jardineworks_:#liferay> right at the top of doFilter basically
09:40 < jardineworks_:#liferay> hmmm
09:41 < jardineworks_:#liferay> I don't see AutoLoginFilter in the list of _filters.
09:42 < jardineworks_:#liferay> oh! found it
09:45 < jardineworks_:#liferay> topolik1, ok very weird. I see the AutoLogin filter. I also see the OpenSSOFilter. WHen I expand it, I see _filterEanbled TWICE... one value has true and the other has false.
09:45 < jardineworks_:#liferay> I do have two instances setup... and this is an instance specific setting I believe... is that why I woul dbe seeing it twice?
09:46 < topolik1:#liferay> these values are read from config files
09:46 < topolik1:#liferay> and should not be shared across cluster
09:47 < topolik1:#liferay> it's possible that it's once defined by portal and for the second time by some your custom hook settings?
09:47 < jardineworks_:#liferay> strange thing is ... I don't see my hook in the list of filters.
09:47 < topolik1:#liferay> hmm
09:48 < topolik1:#liferay> can you try to undeploy the hook and test first w/o it?
09:48 < jardineworks_:#liferay> I was trying to do it without my hook originally ... I just want to trace through OpenSSOFilter... and it wasn't breaking so I added my hook to see if that would work.
09:48 < jardineworks_:#liferay> I'll undeploy though to see
09:52 < modd_:#liferay> jardineworks_: sry, I was afk. I'm pretty new in this vaadin stuff, so I don't know
09:52 < jardineworks_:#liferay> modd_, just curious -- is there some advantage in Vaadin over the other frameworks?
09:53 < jardineworks_:#liferay> urug_, yeah you can do that... you could event leave the copy connected to the original db server if you want.
09:53 < modd_:#liferay> well, it's another kind of doing things... you'll do the view logic in Java, not jsp/xhtml/whatever
09:54 < jardineworks_:#liferay> modd_, right -- I think I read that somewhere... sounds almost like Swing for web applications :)
09:55 < modd_:#liferay> yes
09:55 < modd_:#liferay> but it's gwt
09:56 < jardineworks_:#liferay> modd_, interesting. I guess I need to do more research to see if there is actually any advantage.
09:57 < modd_:#liferay> it's hard to use
09:57 < modd_:#liferay> liferay comes with vaadin 6.8
09:57 < modd_:#liferay> so you need to update
09:58 < jardineworks_:#liferay> topolik1, ok -- so I have removed any properties I set in the portal-ext or my portal-<webid>.properties files -- so now all that remains should be the portal.properties settings. OpenSSOFilter is set to true, and included in the list of auto.login.hooks.... so lets see.
09:58 < jardineworks_:#liferay> modd_, hard to use!? in that case there MUST be some advantage to it .. unless people just like frustrating themselves.
