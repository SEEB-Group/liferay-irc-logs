08:21 < modd_:#liferay> hi topolik (or topolik1^^): do you know if vaadin will be updated in liferay and/or the liferay ide?
08:23 < topolik1:#liferay> hi modd_ :) I'm sorry, Vaadin is completely out of my sight
08:23 < modd_:#liferay> ohh :(
08:24 < topolik1:#liferay> but feel free to ping Greg
09:13 < jardineworks_:#liferay> topolik1, any thoughts on why an auto.login.hook might now be firing? In fact any of them for that matter. I've tried configuring not just my custome one by OpenSSO, SiteMinder, etc. In every case the only breakpoint that gets hit is in the LoginAction class (after I manually type in my username and password)
09:14 < jardineworks_:#liferay> ... actually before as well, on the way to be being redirected to the login page.
09:14 < jardineworks_:#liferay> modd_, I've never tried anything with Vaadin -- can I pick your brain on it?
09:21 < topolik1:#liferay> jardineworks_: AutoLoginFilter is mapped to several locations, for example /c/portal/login
09:21 < topolik1:#liferay> when you try this URL does the breakpoint hit?
09:26 < urug_:#liferay> I need to copy Liferay to another server. Can I just basically copy the whole tomcat+liferay bundle folder and export-import DB?
09:30 < jardineworks_:#liferay> hey topolik1 that is the one I was trying but the only breakpoint that is hit is the one in the LoginAction class. I have breakpoints set in several other classes though.
09:30 < jardineworks_:#liferay> it's so strange... I have never actually had a problem with this feature in the past. three steps, done ...
09:33 < topolik1:#liferay> hmm, can you put breakpoint into AutoLoginFilter?
09:36 < jardineworks_:#liferay> topolik1, I think i have one there... but let m edouble check
09:36 < jardineworks_:#liferay> I have one at line 152
09:36 < jardineworks_:#liferay> never gets hits
09:37 < jardineworks_:#liferay> which is why i think the auto login is not being invoked?
09:37 < jardineworks_:#liferay> but I have not overridden the  com.liferay.portal.servlet.filters.autologin.AutoLoginFilter from the portal.properties -- it is still set to true.
09:38 < topolik1:#liferay> hmm, then you need to stop inside InvokerFilterChain
09:39 < topolik1:#liferay> and see what filters are applied to the URL and look if/how they are applied
09:39 < jardineworks_:#liferay> topolik1, never done that before :)
09:39 < jardineworks_:#liferay> so line 72?
09:39 < jardineworks_:#liferay> right at the top of doFilter basically
09:40 < jardineworks_:#liferay> hmmm
09:41 < jardineworks_:#liferay> I don't see AutoLoginFilter in the list of _filters.
09:42 < jardineworks_:#liferay> oh! found it
