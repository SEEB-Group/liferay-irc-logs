07:47 < leroy:#liferay> In liferay 6.1 I could use http://localhost:8080/c/journal/view_article_content?groupId=10199&articleId=11316 to view an article. In 6.2 the blank page is shown. How can I view the article in Liferay 6.2?

11:42 < marrk:#liferay> hallo
11:44 < marrk:#liferay> is IPC working with 2 different projects aswell? or do both portlets have to be in the same project?
12:08 <@jhf:#liferay> marrk: IPC can cross project boundaries (I assume you are referring to IDE concept of "projects"?). But even if you're referring to plugins, IPC can also cross plugin boundaries.
12:09 < marrk:#liferay> well i have 2 projects in my eclipse(each project for a site) and i want to communicate within those projects (portlets)
12:09 < marrk:#liferay> can i do it the way its written here? http://www.liferay.com/de/community/wiki/-/wiki/Main/Portlet+to+Portlet+Communication?_36_pageResourcePrimKey=6629472   (2.1 IPC)
12:11 <@jhf:#liferay> yep. JSR 286 IPC (via public render parameters or events) can be done between two portlets even if they're not in the same eclipse project
12:15 < marrk:#liferay> ok thanks
12:21 < marrk:#liferay> so i need a link to a function that uses ActionResponse? or is it possible to set the parameters in a jsp ?
12:22 < marrk:#liferay> i need a link that goes to a new page + setting a parameter for the IPC
12:31 <@jhf:#liferay> you can construct the link's URL using the built-in taglibs and <portlet:param> to specify render parameters. here are some examples: http://www.liferaysavvy.com/2013/11/working-with-liferay-urls.html
14:28 < marrk:#liferay> jhf: so i need portlet:actionUrl for calling the function and portlet:renderURL for the link?
