11:44 < marrk:#liferay> is IPC working with 2 different projects aswell? or do both portlets have to be in the same project?
12:08 <@jhf:#liferay> marrk: IPC can cross project boundaries (I assume you are referring to IDE concept of "projects"?). But even if you're referring to plugins, IPC can also cross plugin boundaries.
