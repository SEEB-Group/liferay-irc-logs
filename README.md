These are the Liferay IRC chat logs. Starting with 2013 June 26th; sporadic until 2013 August 10th; then regularly until the present.

You can search these logs through this URI:
http://liferay.seebgroup.com/irc-search.php?q=[search term]

Where [search term] may use regexp and spaces.

Note to self: git commit time's wrong; until 2014 Marc 16 there; then switched to commit on message instead; so from then should be more accurate now.

Gaps in the logs:
- These logs started on the following date:
2013 June 26th
- All prior to below is sporadic:
2013 August 10th 
- 19 June 2014 - 26 June 2014 - forgot to start irssi startup; really need to add startup script for it
