03:28 < modd_:#liferay> hey topolik. I have a problem: I'm creating sites in a portlet using a template. it works fine, the site appears in the sites admin list, however, the site does not appear in the "my sites" menu. when clicking on the entry in the sites admin list I see the sites config page and everything is ok (also the pages from the template are there) and now the site also appears in the drop down menu. any idea what I have to do?
03:28 < modd_:#liferay> I found that as long as I didn't click on the site admin entry the pagecount in layoutset table is 0
09:25 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey topolik ... I don't need anything, I just thought for once I would say hi :)
09:26 < jardineworks:#liferay> without asking for help haha
09:26 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, Are you still around man? I haven't talked to you in forever!
09:37 < topolik:#liferay> jardineworks: hi, haha :)
10:12 < Yam`:#liferay> hi
10:14 < Yam`:#liferay> is it possible to add a page in the control panel?
10:19 < jardineworks:#liferay> Yam`, Yes, you can create portlets that are for the control panel
10:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> Yam`, http://www.liferay.com/web/minhchau.dang/blog/-/blogs/adding-a-plugins-portlet-to-the-control-panel
10:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> The three bullet points are the keys you need to add to the liferay-portlet.xml to get it to work.
10:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik, ok I lied.. I do have a question :)
10:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik, assuming that you use maven at all when doing plugins
10:24 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik, when I create a new plugin project, say a portlet for example, does the maven version using the same SDK_HOME/tools/portlet.tmpl folder to generate the code?
10:25 < topolik:#liferay> jardineworks: I'm sorry, I don't use archetypes to create portlet projects in maven :(
10:26 < topolik:#liferay> assuming you create the new plugin project using some mvn archetype
10:28 < jardineworks:#liferay> good question. I am actually doing it from the Liferay IDE plugins.
10:29 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik, I am a total n00b to maven... just a client requirement. I am guessing that the archetype is what I need to customize (based on what you are saying) and that the tools/* folder changes would only affect the generation if done with ANT.
10:30 < topolik:#liferay> I'm sorry jardineworks, I don't use Liferay IDE and don't know how it creates the project there :(
10:30 < jardineworks:#liferay> bust.
10:30 < jardineworks:#liferay> alright -- I'll keep digging. I'll let you know when I figure it out :)
10:31 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik, ok -- so the changes to SDK_HOME/tools/* definitely are used when you build using an ANT project.
10:45 < Yam`:#liferay> jardineworks, but can I do a page like a page based on a template and then put it in the control panel?
10:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> when you say template, you meant a Web Content Template?
10:47 < jardineworks:#liferay> Yam' ^^
10:48 < jardineworks:#liferay> I mean Yam` ^^ x2 :)
10:49 < Yam`:#liferay> jardineworks, no I mean a page template, not just one portlet
10:50 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> jardineworks: Still alive and kicking. ;) The channel has been very quiet of late.
10:52 < jardineworks:#liferay> Yam`, I'm not sure I understand but you could have a portlet that has other portlets embedded in it? Maybe if you describe to me what it is you are trying to do (don't say put a page template in the control panel :) ) then I'll understand better...
10:52 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, Summer time. Programmers leaving their caves to get sun burns ;)
10:52 < jardineworks:#liferay> and World Cup
10:53 < jardineworks:#liferay> Spain is out -- I'm sad. So I think my fallback team this year is Germany ... \o/ for you guys :)
10:57 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik, I checked out the lifray-maven-support project from git. I think I have ti make my changes there and rebuild/install into a local maven repo in order to do what I am looking for.
10:57 < Yam`:#liferay> jardineworks, well "a portlet" is just one element of a page, no?
10:57 < jardineworks:#liferay> which kinda sucks... a lot more work for future changes. Boo. Why can't the world just continue to love ANT
10:58 < jardineworks:#liferay> Yam`, sure, unless it is the ONLY element on the page. I mean, everything you see in the control panel is a portlet.
10:58 < jardineworks:#liferay> Yam`, don't forget there is also a "full screen" view for a portlet where it can take over the page.
10:58 < Yam`:#liferay> jardineworks, ok, but I want a page with 5/6 portlets on it so it's not just "a portlet"
11:00 < jardineworks:#liferay> Yam`, so two questions...
11:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> Yam`, 1. Do they have to be individual portlets? I often find that developers break features that are really ONE portlet into many ... it's like plugin fever :)
11:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> Yam`, 2. I still think you could do it with embedding runtime portlets.
11:02 < jardineworks:#liferay> just make a wrapper portlet and in its view, add 5 - 6 runtime portlets sstatements
11:03 < jardineworks:#liferay> I think the tag is something like -- <runtime-portlet name="<portlet name>" instance="<some id here>" queryString=""/>
11:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> so you would a have something like :
11:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> <div id="cp-portlet-wrapper">
11:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> 	<div>	
11:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> 		<runtime-portlet name="portlet-1" instance="1234" queryString=""/>
11:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> 	</div>
11:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> 	<div>	
11:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> 		<runtime-portlet name="portlet-2" instance="5678" queryString=""/>
11:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> 	</div>
11:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> 	<div>	
11:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> 		<runtime-portlet name="portlet-3" instance="9012" queryString=""/>
11:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> 	</div>
11:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> </div>
