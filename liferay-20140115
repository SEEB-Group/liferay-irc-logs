03:55 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> hi there
03:57 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> we have browser caching problems with liferay 5.2.3. Here is the gtmetrix report : http://gtmetrix.com/reports/www.interiale.fr/lMUGc9tc. Anyone got advices on configuration ?
04:23 < haba713:#liferay> hi! can you open service.xml with your liferay ide? i get an error message "Failed to create the part's controls". i've installed eclipse again and liferay ide into it. i created a new workspace but i get still the same error.
04:24 < haba713:#liferay> ah... it's maybe this issue: https://support.liferay.com/browse/IDE-1360
04:40 < lapache:#liferay> Hello, i perform an ldap auth with my liferay 6.1.1 instance, but i have a question. Is it possible that all the user's dependant informations are stored inside the ldap ? like secret answer, roles etc... ?
04:47 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> lapache: If I recall correctly, Liferay only syncs it's user database with LDAP. I don't think you can completely replace the user database with LDAP ootb.
04:47 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> *its
05:23 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Does somebody know if this issue has been fixed in any version of Liferay? -> https://www.liferay.com/de/web/kzhang/blog/-/blogs/solving-performance-issue-in-liferay-6-1-staging
07:59 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> hi, we're using liferay 5.2.3 on tomcat 6.0 and we seems to have cache issue (gtmetrix report : http://gtmetrix.com/reports/www.interiale.fr/fujrtHH8). Any advices ?
08:48 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> anyone know how to get the robots.txt file from liferay 5.2.3 ? I would like to be able to access it through : http://[server]/robots.txt
08:49 <@rotty3000:#liferay> Quick Poll: How Many people use SASS anywhere other than themes?
08:54 < whatsoever:#liferay> hey anyone ever used the jsp to connect to another API?
09:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> rotty3000, outside of a theme -- you mean in a plugin itself?
09:19 <@rotty3000:#liferay> yeah, or otherwise?
09:19 <@rotty3000:#liferay> like in a plugin's own CSS files for instance, inline CSS, etc
09:23 < jardineworks:#liferay> rotty3000, I have not had to do that yet, but I can defintiely think of cases where I would.
09:24 <@rotty3000:#liferay> wondering because we want to actually eliminate all runtime SASS compilation
09:25 <@rotty3000:#liferay> it's horribly inefficient.. and making it efficient has an immense cost in engineering and maintenance
09:25 <@rotty3000:#liferay> we're seeing little value in fixing it
09:27 < jardineworks:#liferay> rotty3000, 100% agree. At least make it so that you can turn it off and on.
09:27 < jardineworks:#liferay> its a PITA on our project right now
09:27 < jardineworks:#liferay> For our custom styles we're SASSing it all before we put it into the theme
09:27 <@rotty3000:#liferay> right
09:28 <@jhf:#liferay> rotty3000: would agree -after playing with themes for a while (for my webinar later today) I've come to the conclusion that sass is a good idea but not for runtime :)
09:30 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> rotty3000: I think even for using it in portlets it would be preferable, if SASS compilation would just be integrated into the build process.
09:30 <@rotty3000:#liferay> alright.. I'm sold..
09:30 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> We've been wondering about the whole on-the-fly SASS compilation since we started working with Liferay.
09:30 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> It's especially annoying when you want to use a CDN.
09:30 <@rotty3000:#liferay> I was hoping there would be no backlash from anyone in the community
09:30 < jardineworks:#liferay> yeah yeah! make it a OPTIONAL build step... like "build-service" :)
09:31 < jardineworks:#liferay> +1 beer for this
09:31 < jardineworks:#liferay> -1 hanging
09:31 <@rotty3000:#liferay> :)
09:31 <@jhf:#liferay> hey rotty3000 does that mean one could get rid of DynamicCSSFilter then?
09:31 <@jhf:#liferay> or would it just not do the sass bit
09:31 <@rotty3000:#liferay> jhf, yeah
09:31 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I would be odd to see Liferay using SCSS itself, but not having it available for your own portlets.
09:31 <@jhf:#liferay> there's an option in portal.properties to disable it, but LR itself depends on it
09:31 <@rotty3000:#liferay> but just the sass part
09:32 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> *It
09:33 <@rotty3000:#liferay> thx all
09:33 <@rotty3000:#liferay> valuable information
09:33 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> If I may interrupt: Is there something similar to /c/journal/view_article_content but with the ability to select the template to be used?
09:33 < jardineworks:#liferay> best kill me of the day -- check out what I have to do to calculate the number of rows required for a bananas search results layout --
09:33 < jardineworks:#liferay> <c:set var="totalRows" value="${ fn:substring(totalItems / 4 + ((totalItems mod 4 > 0) ? 1: 0), 0, 1) }"/>
09:33 < jardineworks:#liferay> i love designers.
09:34 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> We have a situation where we are supposed to integrate one part of a Liferay page into another one. And sadly the default template doesn't work for that, so we want to propose creating a second template and then load the content using this template via /c/journal/view_article_content.
09:34 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> But it seems like switching the template isn't possible there... :-(
09:34 < jardineworks:#liferay> "'ll just put a box here, and another one here... and OU! let's overlap them by 1.5 px ... and... OH! I KNOW! different siszes! ... but they have to line up of course. Done."
09:35 < whatsoever:#liferay> <whatsoever> hey anyone ever used  jsp to connect to another API?
09:38 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> anyone know how to get robots.txt file from liferay 5.2.3 ? can't get it
09:42 < jardineworks:#liferay> whatsoever, can you elaborate?
09:42 < jardineworks:#liferay> nicolas_FR, what do you mean "get"?
09:42 < jardineworks:#liferay> you mean you want to see what is in it?
09:44 < whatsoever:#liferay> jardineworks, i need to connect my portlet to the API of my firms software, i  got the developers documentation with all classes, but i have no clue how to connect to the API
09:44 < whatsoever:#liferay> it is running on a tomcat as far as i know
09:45 < jardineworks:#liferay> whatsoever, does your firms software have external access? meaning --  are there services exposed that you can call?
09:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> also -- what kind of software is it? is it just a webapp that accesses a data store?
09:46 < whatsoever:#liferay> well not too sure what you mean: another employee managed to do it with vaadin, but i wanna use JSP for it. well dont know how i can explain my problem exactly ^_^
09:47 < whatsoever:#liferay> he used a services.xml to connect to the API (like that:          <import resource="classpath*:rmi/auth_rmi-client-services.xml" />  )
09:48 < whatsoever:#liferay> and stuff like that: (  <bean class="de.metasonic.support.context.ApplicationContextUtil" /> )
09:48 < jardineworks:#liferay> chances are what he has done in the portlet (.java file) you can do in the jsp. Just copy and paste the code into a <% ... %>
09:48 < jardineworks:#liferay> :)
09:48 < whatsoever:#liferay> yeah that were my toughts , as you can use any java code in jsp
09:49 < jardineworks:#liferay> right -- but not really a best practice
09:49 < whatsoever:#liferay> but i fail to connect to the API, due i am not sure if i can use serviceS.xml?
09:49 < whatsoever:#liferay> well i cant use his code anyway, its just about getting a connection to the API to use the classes
09:49 < jardineworks:#liferay> after including the services.xml in your plugin project, did you run the build-service ant target?
09:50 < whatsoever:#liferay> well that was a point i was worried about: is services.xml a servicelayer? if i just copy the services.xml , i have no option to run the build.service
09:51 < whatsoever:#liferay> but if i create a service layer on my own, its called service.xml, not serviceS.xml, not too sure about the difference though
09:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> oh I see --
09:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> why not ask your coworker what he did?
09:53 < whatsoever:#liferay> well i have a meeting next week, does not help me much atm ^_^
09:55 < whatsoever:#liferay> well just gonna make it with my own service layer and see whats happening ^_^
09:58 < jardineworks:#liferay> whatsoever, either way, you should probably be making the API calls from the portlet class (the .java file(s)) .. not the JSP.
09:59 < whatsoever:#liferay> hmm.. gonna be working in some cases, but when i have a table that shows information about user (for example), i cant do it over the .java file?)
