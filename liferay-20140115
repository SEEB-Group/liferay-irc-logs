03:55 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> hi there
03:57 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> we have browser caching problems with liferay 5.2.3. Here is the gtmetrix report : http://gtmetrix.com/reports/www.interiale.fr/lMUGc9tc. Anyone got advices on configuration ?
04:23 < haba713:#liferay> hi! can you open service.xml with your liferay ide? i get an error message "Failed to create the part's controls". i've installed eclipse again and liferay ide into it. i created a new workspace but i get still the same error.
04:24 < haba713:#liferay> ah... it's maybe this issue: https://support.liferay.com/browse/IDE-1360
04:40 < lapache:#liferay> Hello, i perform an ldap auth with my liferay 6.1.1 instance, but i have a question. Is it possible that all the user's dependant informations are stored inside the ldap ? like secret answer, roles etc... ?
04:47 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> lapache: If I recall correctly, Liferay only syncs it's user database with LDAP. I don't think you can completely replace the user database with LDAP ootb.
04:47 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> *its
05:23 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Does somebody know if this issue has been fixed in any version of Liferay? -> https://www.liferay.com/de/web/kzhang/blog/-/blogs/solving-performance-issue-in-liferay-6-1-staging
07:59 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> hi, we're using liferay 5.2.3 on tomcat 6.0 and we seems to have cache issue (gtmetrix report : http://gtmetrix.com/reports/www.interiale.fr/fujrtHH8). Any advices ?
08:48 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> anyone know how to get the robots.txt file from liferay 5.2.3 ? I would like to be able to access it through : http://[server]/robots.txt

08:54 < whatsoever:#liferay> hey anyone ever used the jsp to connect to another API?
09:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> rotty3000, outside of a theme -- you mean in a plugin itself?
09:19 <@rotty3000:#liferay> yeah, or otherwise?
09:19 <@rotty3000:#liferay> like in a plugin's own CSS files for instance, inline CSS, etc
09:23 < jardineworks:#liferay> rotty3000, I have not had to do that yet, but I can defintiely think of cases where I would.
