00:32 < nancy_>  Hi anybody is familiar about integrating alfresco into liferay?
00:32 < nancy_> I have got a small issue can anybody help me out on the same?
03:25 < Yamw> <jardineworks> Yamw_, how's it going? you get the dev env. setup? > I'm French so I wasn't there anymore, the setup took me til the end of my working hours
03:51 < nicolas_FR> hi there
03:53 < nicolas_FR> hi jardineworks , I just saw you called for me yesterday 9pm ?
03:56 < nicolas_FR> does anyone know if having 2 communities, we can have the same login portlet which will only allow people with the right community to log in, and others will be refused (even if they already have an account for the other community)
03:57 < nicolas_FR> like having a portal with a "game" and a "work" community. You have to create an account for both community because your "game" account won't be accepted to log in the "work" community. Possible ?
05:03 < nicolas_FR> problem solved : DNS servers were moved and changes were not in the conf of the server I'm working on
08:52 < jardineworks> Yamw, ah -- so you have your environment up and running though?
08:53 < Yamw> yes I do
08:55 < Yamw> jardineworks, so if I want to do my own portlet with bootstrap, javascript, html and css I need to create the portlet in eclipse?
09:14 < jardineworks> Yamw, you don't have to... it's just easier with the Liferay IDE. Do Window > Open Perspective > Other and then look for Liferay
09:14 < Yamw> jardineworks, done
09:15 < jardineworks> Yamw, now, you have to configure the SDK and tomcat server. Window > Preferences and then in the left hand pane of the dialog window find Liferay
09:16 < jardineworks> expand it and choose Installed Plugin SDK
09:16 < jardineworks> Click Add .. and then you basically navigate to where ever you unpacked the SDK archive.
09:16 < jardineworks> Then, in the left pane, find Server > Runtime Environments
09:17 < jardineworks> Add > Expand Liferay and choose your version (6.2CE I think it was)
09:20 < Yamw> yep that's it
09:20 < jardineworks> ok ..
09:21 < jardineworks> now in the Navigator pain (left of the editor workbench) ... right click New > Liferay PLugin Project and choose to create a portlet plugin
09:21 < Yamw> ok
09:22 < jardineworks> do NOT launch the new portlet wizard. You should when you get the hang of this, but for now, keep it simple.
09:22 < jardineworks> once the project is created
09:22 < Yamw> what's the different between creating a portlet and a plugin project?
09:22 < jardineworks> expand it and find docroot/WEB-INF/ and click on liferay\-display.xml
09:22 < jardineworks> liferay-display.xml
09:23 < jardineworks> click on the source tab (at the bottom of the workbench pane) and set the category name="Yam"
09:23 < jardineworks> then in the bottom right, add the ANT target for the project (click the +, find the project, expand it and choose the build.xml)
09:24 < jardineworks> Is your server running?
09:24 < Yamw> yes it is
09:25 < jardineworks> great, if you double click the ant window entry, then it will build and copy the WAR to the /deploy folder in LIFERAY_HOME. The autodeploy listener should pick it up, unpack it and move it into webapps.
09:25 < jardineworks> (there is one thing I think we missed but lets see)
09:25 < jardineworks> in a terminal window, you should tail -f TOMCAT_HOME/logs/catalina.out so that you can see that it's all working
09:25 < jardineworks> if its not, let me know
09:25 < jardineworks> :)
09:26 < jardineworks> we're basically just validating that the project you just made works and that your environment is configured. Next we'll add the portlet to a page and then put your code in.
09:26 < Yamw> the plugin project is still creating for now
09:27 < jardineworks> gotcha.

09:44 < Yamw:#liferay> and I don't know what you meant with your "to", the sentence is great without :)
09:44 < Yamw:#liferay> I work near Paris (like 1km north)
09:45 < jardineworks:#liferay> I was in Paris last summer!  and Lyons, and Montpellier.
09:45 < jardineworks:#liferay> and Lamure sur Lazergu and Villefranche :)
09:46 < Yamw:#liferay> Nice, for holidays?
09:46 < Yamw:#liferay> I've never been to Lyon or Montpellier but it is known to be great cities
09:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> yeah -- went backpacking with my Wife and 3 year old. Scotland -> France -> Spain
09:46 < Yamw:#liferay> Great :D
09:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> Lyon was awesome. The food was amazing. And Montpellier was just for a couple of days layover for a train but it was beautiful as well.
09:47 < Yamw:#liferay> yeah, the south of France is beautiful
09:48 < Yamw:#liferay> well, Lyon must be beautiful too, I love moutains
09:50 < jardineworks:#liferay> yeah -- I am sad that I didn't make it over to the beach part but that's just an excuse to go back :)
09:52 < jardineworks:#liferay> Yamw, Ok, I am going to go back to my code audit. Ping me when you are ready to continue.
09:54 < Yamw:#liferay> yep no problem
10:03 < Yamw:#liferay> jardineworks, I've set the category name to Yam and I tried to add the ANT target but I don't find the build.xml in the window
10:03 < Yamw:#liferay> but there's already a "Demands-portlet" entry in the ant tab
10:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> Yamw, ah, its already there
10:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> double-click it
10:04 < Yamw:#liferay> I've tried double clicking it and it ends up on an error (null pointer exception)
10:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> ok so...
10:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> go to the folder where you unpacked SDK
10:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> in there tell me if you see a file called build.properties.
10:05 < Yamw:#liferay> yes there is, and theres a build.yam.properties
10:05 < Yamw:#liferay> that I've set up following the wiki
10:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> ah ok
10:06 < jardineworks:#liferay> are you in a GUI folder view or in the terminal?
10:06 < Yamw:#liferay> both
10:15 < jardineworks:#liferay> ok -- in terminal, do me a favour
10:15 < jardineworks:#liferay> go into the portlet/demands-portlet folder
10:15 < jardineworks:#liferay> and run ant deploy
10:20 < Yamw:#liferay> ECJ wasn't installed so it installed it after the first ant deploy and I had to do it again
10:20 < Yamw:#liferay> build successful
10:21 -!- mode/#liferay [+o jhf] by ChanServ
10:26 < jardineworks:#liferay> Yamw, awesome. Now, log into the portal as an administrator
10:26 < jardineworks:#liferay> then Add a page.
10:26 < jardineworks:#liferay> go to that page
10:27 < jardineworks:#liferay> from the tool bar on the side choose the + , then choose applications, find the YAM category and drag your portlet onto the page.
10:29 < Yamw:#liferay> there's a $theme.runtime("145") in the top left of the liferay site
10:29 < Yamw:#liferay> I don't know if it's related
10:30 < jardineworks:#liferay> that is trying to embed portlet name 145 in the theme.
10:30 < jardineworks:#liferay> do you see the menu? (I'm not sure which portlet 145 is)
10:30 < Yamw:#liferay> nope
10:30 < jardineworks:#liferay> shoot... it might be the menu. One sec.
10:31 < jardineworks:#liferay> Yeah -- its the docbar.
10:31 < jardineworks:#liferay> do you have any JS errors in your firebug/inspector?
10:31 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, \o/
10:31 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, I have advanced Liferay question to grill someone from Liferay with :)
10:32 <@jhf:#liferay> havent’ seen that CFP submission yet…
10:32 <@jhf:#liferay> :)
10:32 < Yamw:#liferay> no I don't
10:32 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, I contacted Rally (Sprouts) about it. Apparently Mercatus hasn't paid their bill but they are hoping that it will be paid this/next week... in which case they will reach out to the CIO to see what he says.
10:33 < jardineworks:#liferay> Yamw, try closing your broser and starting over :)
10:33 < jardineworks:#liferay> browser*
10:33 <@jhf:#liferay> yay! whats the question?
10:33 < jardineworks:#liferay> haha
10:34 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, On .. I have done all sorts of madness with clustering and session replication. I know so much more about Tomcat/JGroups/Tribes etc than I ever wanted to know. Now, the thing is, the replication mechanism doesn't always seems to work properly. So my client is saying, let's just not replicate sessions and implement a policy of not using the session to store stuff.
10:34 < jardineworks:#liferay> BUT
10:35 < Yamw:#liferay> same issue after relaunching firefox
10:35 < jardineworks:#liferay> Liferay no doubt uses the session right? like at the very least LIFERAY_SHARED vars, and if I am not mistake PRP are stored at in the application session right?
10:35 < jardineworks:#liferay> so we can't just "turn sessions" off
10:35 < jardineworks:#liferay> Yamw, last resort. Shut down the server, clear the work/temp folders in TOMCAT_HOME and restart the server.
10:38 <@jhf:#liferay> jardineworks: i’ve no experience with clustering but reading https://www.liferay.com/community/wiki/-/wiki/Main/Clustering says to turn off session replication, and instead configure your load balancer for sticky sessions (so if you hit one node, you’ll stay on that node for the life of your session)
10:39 < Yamw:#liferay> jardineworks, rm -rf * in temp and work?
10:40 <@jhf:#liferay> also, an expert (Olaf Kock) recommends the same, recently: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21749687/liferay-cluster-session-replication
10:40 < jardineworks:#liferay> Yam yeah  --- rm -rf temp && rm -rf work && mkdir temp && mkdir work
10:41 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, I know I know... but I didn't listen to any of you because my client wouldn't listen :) So I went ahead and got it working anyway... even the Tomcat guys say not to use it.
10:42 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, it works MOST of the time but ever now and then a Member from the cluster falls out and then comes back. So what I have convinced the client to do is use sticky sessions + replication in hopes that in a disaster scenario where a node explodes, the user can continue to work but is passed to the other node.
10:43 < jardineworks:#liferay> I don't think we can eliminate the session altogether. I think the best we can hope for is to implement a valve (or find one that is already done) that can be used to pipe session data to a cache so that the internals of Tomcat and LR remain the same but we can use somehting like memcache or ehcache to save session state
10:44 < jardineworks:#liferay> If we could leverage Liferays ehcache that would be idea since the replication is already managed.
10:44 <@jhf:#liferay> that sounds good, but you’re well beyond my abilities already :)
10:44 < jardineworks:#liferay> This just sounds like a complicated thing to solve.
10:44 < jardineworks:#liferay> personally, I would vote for a lost session! :)
10:50 < Yamw:#liferay> jardineworks, that didn't change the problem :/
10:58 < jardineworks:#liferay> Yamw, damit.
10:58 < jardineworks:#liferay> What browser are you using?
11:00 < Yamw:#liferay> jardineworks, firefox
11:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> Yamw, can you try with Chrome (just curious)
11:02 < Yamw:#liferay> I don't have it but I'll try with Midori (webkit)
11:04 < Yamw:#liferay> same
11:04 < Yamw:#liferay> brb
11:07 < jardineworks:#liferay> Yamw, and still no errors in the JS console?
11:41 < barrie:#liferay> hello all... I'm trying to limit the search results by a users permission (6.1 CE) and know there is a way.. but I'm a bit rusty
11:41 < barrie:#liferay> any suggestions?
11:43 < barrie:#liferay> pretty sure it has to do with overriding
11:43 < barrie:#liferay> 	private static final boolean _PERMISSION_AWARE = false;
11:48 < Yamw:#liferay> jardineworks, nope
11:50 < jardineworks:#liferay> barrie, It's not done implicitly?
11:50 < jardineworks:#liferay> Yamw, boo
11:50 < Yamw:#liferay> haha :(
11:51 < modd_:#liferay> anyone created sites in java code already?
11:52 < jardineworks:#liferay> Yamw, was it working before you deployed your plugin?
11:55 < Yamw:#liferay> it worked a few days before and yesterday the menu disappeared, but I didn't have the $theme.runtime("145") until today (after the plugin I think)
11:56 < jardineworks:#liferay> Yamw, have you developed your own theme?
11:56 < Yamw:#liferay> jardineworks, not at all, just sites and pages
11:58 < jardineworks:#liferay> hmm
11:59 < jardineworks:#liferay> did you say that you were using a MySQL db? yes right?
11:59 < Yamw:#liferay> yes
12:00 < jardineworks:#liferay> Yamw, anything you can't lose? I am about to suggest you dump the portal install and start over. Basically drop the database, recreate it and restart Liferay
12:02 < Yamw:#liferay> well it's a test platform but I wouln't lose it again when it is the prod version
12:02 < jardineworks:#liferay> right
12:03 < jardineworks:#liferay> I'm not sure what happened to be honest -- just trying to stick to our initial goal of showing you how to build a portlet to do what you are trying to do outside Liferay :)
12:03 < jardineworks:#liferay> .. so that you can do it inside Liferay
12:03 < barrie:#liferay> jardineworks no.. it's showing results the user should not see and when they click, it gives them an error
12:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> barrie, is this Web Content search of federated search?
12:08 < barrie:#liferay> it's a search done in custom code (I didn't write it.. just reviewing the bug)
12:09 < Yamw:#liferay> I'll have to build another VM in real conditions (those of the client) in the near future so... I'll see tomorrow morning if I can have the new VM or else I'll clean the existing liferay as you've said
12:09 < Yamw:#liferay> for that scenario, what are the steps to make (to do?)?
12:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> which scenario? to rebuild?
12:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> barrie, you mean the code is making its own Boolean Query and context and then firing it off?
12:10 < Yamw:#liferay> yes, to rebuild
12:11 < barrie:#liferay> jardineworks using AssetEntriesFacet and creating a searchContext
12:12 < barrie:#liferay> jardineworks Indexer indexer = FacetedSearcher.getInstance();
12:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> Yamw, If you clone the current VM all you need to do is in your clone, drop the schema from mysql. Then create it again (same name) and add the user that is configured in the portal-ext for Liferay with full privileges.
12:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> Yamw, when you restart the server you will see it creating the tables and everything from scratch.
12:12 < Yamw:#liferay> In that scenario I won't clone the VM I'll just keep the existing one
12:13 < jardineworks:#liferay> barrie, Looking at he SearchContext.java class there is a method --
12:13 < jardineworks:#liferay> 	public boolean isScopeStrict() {
12:13 < jardineworks:#liferay> 		return _scopeStrict;
12:13 < jardineworks:#liferay> 	}
12:16 < barrie:#liferay> jardineworks and great javadocs for that too :-)
12:17 < jardineworks:#liferay> lol
12:19 < barrie:#liferay> jardineworks just tried it.. no difference.. but thanks..
12:19 < barrie:#liferay> jardineworks seems like a missing permission checker.. or the index is not using permissions
12:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> barrie, you need rotty... his name is on the FacetedSearcher class. but I can see in the search() method for the FacetedSearcher that it does --
12:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> PermissionChecker permissionChecker =
12:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> 				PermissionThreadLocal.getPermissionChecker();
12:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> if (isFilterSearch(searchContext) && (permissionChecker != null)) {
12:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> 				searchContext.setEnd(end + INDEX_FILTER_SEARCH_LIMIT);
12:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> 				searchContext.setStart(0);
12:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> 			}
12:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> it must be a postProcessor since the permissions are not stored in lucene right?
12:21 < barrie:#liferay> jardineworks I'm guessing that as well...
12:21 < barrie:#liferay> jardineworks OK.. thanks.. I'll also have a look there. appreciate the help
12:22 < barrie:#liferay> jardineworks also may be something with isFilterSearch
12:22 < jardineworks:#liferay> right
12:23 < jardineworks:#liferay> but that seems to just check that class types (journal, dlentry, etc)
12:23 < jardineworks:#liferay> for (String entryClassName : searchContext.getEntryClassNames()) {
12:23 < jardineworks:#liferay> 			Indexer indexer = IndexerRegistryUtil.getIndexer(entryClassName);
12:24 < jardineworks:#liferay> IndexerPostProcessor is an interface and is only implemented by BaseIndexerPostProcessor... and there are only two classes that extend it -- OrganizationIndexerPostProcessor and UserIndexerPostProcessor.
12:25 < barrie:#liferay> jardineworks yea.. was just looking at that
12:29 < jardineworks:#liferay> barrie, SearchEngineUtil.setSearchPermissionChecker( SearchPermissionChecker searchPermissionChecker)
