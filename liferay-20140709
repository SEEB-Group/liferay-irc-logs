00:32 < nancy_>  Hi anybody is familiar about integrating alfresco into liferay?
00:32 < nancy_> I have got a small issue can anybody help me out on the same?
03:25 < Yamw> <jardineworks> Yamw_, how's it going? you get the dev env. setup? > I'm French so I wasn't there anymore, the setup took me til the end of my working hours
03:51 < nicolas_FR> hi there
03:53 < nicolas_FR> hi jardineworks , I just saw you called for me yesterday 9pm ?
03:56 < nicolas_FR> does anyone know if having 2 communities, we can have the same login portlet which will only allow people with the right community to log in, and others will be refused (even if they already have an account for the other community)
03:57 < nicolas_FR> like having a portal with a "game" and a "work" community. You have to create an account for both community because your "game" account won't be accepted to log in the "work" community. Possible ?
05:03 < nicolas_FR> problem solved : DNS servers were moved and changes were not in the conf of the server I'm working on
08:52 < jardineworks> Yamw, ah -- so you have your environment up and running though?
08:53 < Yamw> yes I do
08:55 < Yamw> jardineworks, so if I want to do my own portlet with bootstrap, javascript, html and css I need to create the portlet in eclipse?
09:14 < jardineworks> Yamw, you don't have to... it's just easier with the Liferay IDE. Do Window > Open Perspective > Other and then look for Liferay
09:14 < Yamw> jardineworks, done
09:15 < jardineworks> Yamw, now, you have to configure the SDK and tomcat server. Window > Preferences and then in the left hand pane of the dialog window find Liferay
09:16 < jardineworks> expand it and choose Installed Plugin SDK
09:16 < jardineworks> Click Add .. and then you basically navigate to where ever you unpacked the SDK archive.
09:16 < jardineworks> Then, in the left pane, find Server > Runtime Environments
09:17 < jardineworks> Add > Expand Liferay and choose your version (6.2CE I think it was)
09:20 < Yamw> yep that's it
09:20 < jardineworks> ok ..
09:21 < jardineworks> now in the Navigator pain (left of the editor workbench) ... right click New > Liferay PLugin Project and choose to create a portlet plugin
09:21 < Yamw> ok
09:22 < jardineworks> do NOT launch the new portlet wizard. You should when you get the hang of this, but for now, keep it simple.
09:22 < jardineworks> once the project is created
09:22 < Yamw> what's the different between creating a portlet and a plugin project?
09:22 < jardineworks> expand it and find docroot/WEB-INF/ and click on liferay\-display.xml
09:22 < jardineworks> liferay-display.xml
09:23 < jardineworks> click on the source tab (at the bottom of the workbench pane) and set the category name="Yam"
09:23 < jardineworks> then in the bottom right, add the ANT target for the project (click the +, find the project, expand it and choose the build.xml)
09:24 < jardineworks> Is your server running?
09:24 < Yamw> yes it is
09:25 < jardineworks> great, if you double click the ant window entry, then it will build and copy the WAR to the /deploy folder in LIFERAY_HOME. The autodeploy listener should pick it up, unpack it and move it into webapps.
09:25 < jardineworks> (there is one thing I think we missed but lets see)
09:25 < jardineworks> in a terminal window, you should tail -f TOMCAT_HOME/logs/catalina.out so that you can see that it's all working
09:25 < jardineworks> if its not, let me know
09:25 < jardineworks> :)
09:26 < jardineworks> we're basically just validating that the project you just made works and that your environment is configured. Next we'll add the portlet to a page and then put your code in.
09:26 < Yamw> the plugin project is still creating for now
09:27 < jardineworks> gotcha.

09:44 < Yamw:#liferay> and I don't know what you meant with your "to", the sentence is great without :)
09:44 < Yamw:#liferay> I work near Paris (like 1km north)
09:45 < jardineworks:#liferay> I was in Paris last summer!  and Lyons, and Montpellier.
09:45 < jardineworks:#liferay> and Lamure sur Lazergu and Villefranche :)
09:46 < Yamw:#liferay> Nice, for holidays?
09:46 < Yamw:#liferay> I've never been to Lyon or Montpellier but it is known to be great cities
09:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> yeah -- went backpacking with my Wife and 3 year old. Scotland -> France -> Spain
09:46 < Yamw:#liferay> Great :D
09:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> Lyon was awesome. The food was amazing. And Montpellier was just for a couple of days layover for a train but it was beautiful as well.
09:47 < Yamw:#liferay> yeah, the south of France is beautiful
09:48 < Yamw:#liferay> well, Lyon must be beautiful too, I love moutains
09:50 < jardineworks:#liferay> yeah -- I am sad that I didn't make it over to the beach part but that's just an excuse to go back :)
09:52 < jardineworks:#liferay> Yamw, Ok, I am going to go back to my code audit. Ping me when you are ready to continue.
09:54 < Yamw:#liferay> yep no problem
10:03 < Yamw:#liferay> jardineworks, I've set the category name to Yam and I tried to add the ANT target but I don't find the build.xml in the window
10:03 < Yamw:#liferay> but there's already a "Demands-portlet" entry in the ant tab
10:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> Yamw, ah, its already there
10:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> double-click it
10:04 < Yamw:#liferay> I've tried double clicking it and it ends up on an error (null pointer exception)
10:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> ok so...
10:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> go to the folder where you unpacked SDK
10:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> in there tell me if you see a file called build.properties.
10:05 < Yamw:#liferay> yes there is, and theres a build.yam.properties
10:05 < Yamw:#liferay> that I've set up following the wiki
10:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> ah ok
10:06 < jardineworks:#liferay> are you in a GUI folder view or in the terminal?
10:06 < Yamw:#liferay> both
10:15 < jardineworks:#liferay> ok -- in terminal, do me a favour
10:15 < jardineworks:#liferay> go into the portlet/demands-portlet folder
10:15 < jardineworks:#liferay> and run ant deploy
10:20 < Yamw:#liferay> ECJ wasn't installed so it installed it after the first ant deploy and I had to do it again
10:20 < Yamw:#liferay> build successful
10:21 -!- mode/#liferay [+o jhf] by ChanServ
10:26 < jardineworks:#liferay> Yamw, awesome. Now, log into the portal as an administrator
10:26 < jardineworks:#liferay> then Add a page.
10:26 < jardineworks:#liferay> go to that page
10:27 < jardineworks:#liferay> from the tool bar on the side choose the + , then choose applications, find the YAM category and drag your portlet onto the page.
10:29 < Yamw:#liferay> there's a $theme.runtime("145") in the top left of the liferay site
10:29 < Yamw:#liferay> I don't know if it's related
10:30 < jardineworks:#liferay> that is trying to embed portlet name 145 in the theme.
10:30 < jardineworks:#liferay> do you see the menu? (I'm not sure which portlet 145 is)
10:30 < Yamw:#liferay> nope
10:30 < jardineworks:#liferay> shoot... it might be the menu. One sec.
10:31 < jardineworks:#liferay> Yeah -- its the docbar.
10:31 < jardineworks:#liferay> do you have any JS errors in your firebug/inspector?
10:31 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, \o/
10:31 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, I have advanced Liferay question to grill someone from Liferay with :)
10:32 <@jhf:#liferay> havent’ seen that CFP submission yet…
10:32 <@jhf:#liferay> :)
10:32 < Yamw:#liferay> no I don't
10:32 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, I contacted Rally (Sprouts) about it. Apparently Mercatus hasn't paid their bill but they are hoping that it will be paid this/next week... in which case they will reach out to the CIO to see what he says.
