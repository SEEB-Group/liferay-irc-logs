00:32 < nancy_>  Hi anybody is familiar about integrating alfresco into liferay?
00:32 < nancy_> I have got a small issue can anybody help me out on the same?
03:25 < Yamw> <jardineworks> Yamw_, how's it going? you get the dev env. setup? > I'm French so I wasn't there anymore, the setup took me til the end of my working hours
03:51 < nicolas_FR> hi there
03:53 < nicolas_FR> hi jardineworks , I just saw you called for me yesterday 9pm ?
03:56 < nicolas_FR> does anyone know if having 2 communities, we can have the same login portlet which will only allow people with the right community to log in, and others will be refused (even if they already have an account for the other community)
03:57 < nicolas_FR> like having a portal with a "game" and a "work" community. You have to create an account for both community because your "game" account won't be accepted to log in the "work" community. Possible ?
05:03 < nicolas_FR> problem solved : DNS servers were moved and changes were not in the conf of the server I'm working on
08:52 < jardineworks> Yamw, ah -- so you have your environment up and running though?
08:53 < Yamw> yes I do
08:55 < Yamw> jardineworks, so if I want to do my own portlet with bootstrap, javascript, html and css I need to create the portlet in eclipse?
09:14 < jardineworks> Yamw, you don't have to... it's just easier with the Liferay IDE. Do Window > Open Perspective > Other and then look for Liferay
09:14 < Yamw> jardineworks, done
09:15 < jardineworks> Yamw, now, you have to configure the SDK and tomcat server. Window > Preferences and then in the left hand pane of the dialog window find Liferay
09:16 < jardineworks> expand it and choose Installed Plugin SDK
09:16 < jardineworks> Click Add .. and then you basically navigate to where ever you unpacked the SDK archive.
09:16 < jardineworks> Then, in the left pane, find Server > Runtime Environments
09:17 < jardineworks> Add > Expand Liferay and choose your version (6.2CE I think it was)
09:20 < Yamw> yep that's it
09:20 < jardineworks> ok ..
09:21 < jardineworks> now in the Navigator pain (left of the editor workbench) ... right click New > Liferay PLugin Project and choose to create a portlet plugin
09:21 < Yamw> ok
09:22 < jardineworks> do NOT launch the new portlet wizard. You should when you get the hang of this, but for now, keep it simple.
09:22 < jardineworks> once the project is created
09:22 < Yamw> what's the different between creating a portlet and a plugin project?
09:22 < jardineworks> expand it and find docroot/WEB-INF/ and click on liferay\-display.xml
09:22 < jardineworks> liferay-display.xml
09:23 < jardineworks> click on the source tab (at the bottom of the workbench pane) and set the category name="Yam"
09:23 < jardineworks> then in the bottom right, add the ANT target for the project (click the +, find the project, expand it and choose the build.xml)
09:24 < jardineworks> Is your server running?
09:24 < Yamw> yes it is
09:25 < jardineworks> great, if you double click the ant window entry, then it will build and copy the WAR to the /deploy folder in LIFERAY_HOME. The autodeploy listener should pick it up, unpack it and move it into webapps.
09:25 < jardineworks> (there is one thing I think we missed but lets see)
09:25 < jardineworks> in a terminal window, you should tail -f TOMCAT_HOME/logs/catalina.out so that you can see that it's all working
09:25 < jardineworks> if its not, let me know
09:25 < jardineworks> :)
09:26 < jardineworks> we're basically just validating that the project you just made works and that your environment is configured. Next we'll add the portlet to a page and then put your code in.
09:26 < Yamw> the plugin project is still creating for now
09:27 < jardineworks> gotcha.

09:45 < jardineworks:#liferay> and Lamure sur Lazergu and Villefranche :)
09:46 < Yamw:#liferay> Nice, for holidays?
09:46 < Yamw:#liferay> I've never been to Lyon or Montpellier but it is known to be great cities
09:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> yeah -- went backpacking with my Wife and 3 year old. Scotland -> France -> Spain
09:46 < Yamw:#liferay> Great :D
09:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> Lyon was awesome. The food was amazing. And Montpellier was just for a couple of days layover for a train but it was beautiful as well.
09:47 < Yamw:#liferay> yeah, the south of France is beautiful
