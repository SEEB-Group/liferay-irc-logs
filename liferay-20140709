00:32 < nancy_>  Hi anybody is familiar about integrating alfresco into liferay?
00:32 < nancy_> I have got a small issue can anybody help me out on the same?
03:25 < Yamw> <jardineworks> Yamw_, how's it going? you get the dev env. setup? > I'm French so I wasn't there anymore, the setup took me til the end of my working hours
03:51 < nicolas_FR> hi there
03:53 < nicolas_FR> hi jardineworks , I just saw you called for me yesterday 9pm ?
03:56 < nicolas_FR> does anyone know if having 2 communities, we can have the same login portlet which will only allow people with the right community to log in, and others will be refused (even if they already have an account for the other community)
03:57 < nicolas_FR> like having a portal with a "game" and a "work" community. You have to create an account for both community because your "game" account won't be accepted to log in the "work" community. Possible ?
05:03 < nicolas_FR> problem solved : DNS servers were moved and changes were not in the conf of the server I'm working on
08:52 < jardineworks> Yamw, ah -- so you have your environment up and running though?
08:53 < Yamw> yes I do
08:55 < Yamw> jardineworks, so if I want to do my own portlet with bootstrap, javascript, html and css I need to create the portlet in eclipse?
09:14 < jardineworks> Yamw, you don't have to... it's just easier with the Liferay IDE. Do Window > Open Perspective > Other and then look for Liferay
09:14 < Yamw> jardineworks, done
09:15 < jardineworks> Yamw, now, you have to configure the SDK and tomcat server. Window > Preferences and then in the left hand pane of the dialog window find Liferay
09:16 < jardineworks> expand it and choose Installed Plugin SDK
09:16 < jardineworks> Click Add .. and then you basically navigate to where ever you unpacked the SDK archive.
09:16 < jardineworks> Then, in the left pane, find Server > Runtime Environments
09:17 < jardineworks> Add > Expand Liferay and choose your version (6.2CE I think it was)
09:20 < Yamw> yep that's it
09:20 < jardineworks> ok ..
09:21 < jardineworks> now in the Navigator pain (left of the editor workbench) ... right click New > Liferay PLugin Project and choose to create a portlet plugin
09:21 < Yamw> ok
09:22 < jardineworks> do NOT launch the new portlet wizard. You should when you get the hang of this, but for now, keep it simple.
