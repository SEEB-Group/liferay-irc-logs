06:54 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Meh. When I try to open the publishing dialog, I get a "Failed to load content" after about a minute. So annoying...
07:12 < hufg:#liferay> 8)
07:13 < hufg:#liferay> yeah seen that a few times
08:20 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I honestley regret using Liferay by now.
08:20 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> We would have been better off with Wordpress or even statis HTML.
08:20 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> *static

09:04 < hufg:#liferay> :-(
09:09 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> And I also get the feeling that I'm the only idiot trying to get a Liferay cluster running in the Amazon cloud.
09:14 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Feels like using staging is similar to being suicidal.
09:36 < hufg:#liferay> i can give you a script that prints liferay related quotes when you use your terminal
09:36 < hufg:#liferay> 500% morale boost
09:37 < hufg:#liferay> I love the smell of Liferay in the morning!
09:37 < hufg:#liferay> 'very nice
09:37 < hufg:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur: staging is a bit risky but local staging without migrations has worked for us so far
09:37 < hufg:#liferay> in GA2
09:37 < hufg:#liferay> remote staging is a baaad mistake
09:39 < hufg:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/825713844e351e175531 run that script on bashrc, single 500% morale boost every day
09:40 < hufg:#liferay> no need for echo on line 17 :(
09:52 < jardineworks:#liferay> hufg, hahah .. awesome
09:52 < jardineworks:#liferay> you should easter egg this into your deployment.
09:52 < hufg:#liferay> yes :D
10:08 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I just tried disabling staging.
10:08 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Just for fun.
10:08 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> It broke my entire local setup. :D
10:43 < timmy_:#liferay> hello
10:46 < timmy_:#liferay> is it possible to publish content with default "guest view" permission?
10:59 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I hate this. Why does Liferay even do anything with the DL when I publish something that doesn't even have anything to do with the DL? -.-
11:11 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> hufg: You still around?
11:12 < timmy_:#liferay> jhf: do you know if it possible to publish web content by default with view permission for guests?
11:13 <@jhf:#liferay> timmy_: yes this is possible, we do this on liferay.com as well.. just trying to think where the setting is.
11:25 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Wow. Apparently some of these issues with the publishing dialog are due to overly long request URIs. What the...!?
11:30 < timmy_:#liferay> jhf: thanks, I could not find it either
11:30 <@jhf:#liferay> still looking timmy_ - got sidetracked. it's most likely some impossible to remember portal property
11:32 < timmy_:#liferay> ok, as long as it's not some custom hook or so?
11:44 <@jhf:#liferay> timmy_: so I'm looking at the default resource permissions for new journal articles. I believe the "Guest" role has permissions to VIEW newly created articles.
11:45 <@jhf:#liferay> https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/blob/master/portal-impl/src/resource-actions/journal.xml#L79
11:45 <@jhf:#liferay> what am I missing?
11:51 < timmy_:#liferay> Is this overridden in an ext plugin?
11:57 < jardineworks:#liferay> timmy_, I think that is a question you would answer for us :)
11:58 < jardineworks:#liferay> or do you mean COULD this be overridden? In which case I would hazard a guess at yes since you can pretty much override anything with an EXT.
11:59 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah the only way to override this for the OOTB portlets is with an ext plugin. unless something's changed in 6.2.
12:04 < modd:#liferay> hey jhf, I have a question about the liferay.com EE lesa ticket system/portlet
12:04 < modd:#liferay> is it tied to an internal jira?
12:04 <@jhf:#liferay> modd: nope, does not use JIRA as a backend - it's a custom LR service implemented in Liferay
12:05 < modd:#liferay> so completely done in liferay.
12:05 < modd:#liferay> we're thinking currently how to do something like this
12:06 < modd:#liferay> we have some jira integration in some portlets, but it's not as easy to allow a more general purpose
12:06 < modd:#liferay> it may be easier to integrate OTRS
12:08 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah.. possibly. I'm not 100% about why we switched from JIRA to our own.. guess we had too many customization requirements maybe?
12:09 < modd:#liferay> yeah, jira sucks at integrationability^^
12:09 <@jhf:#liferay> http://cmsreport.com/articles/liferay-releases-liferay-enterprise-support-application-2798
12:09 <@jhf:#liferay> guess we also did not like JIRA's UX :)
12:09 <@jhf:#liferay> I can believe that. customers faced with tons of fields with weird names.
12:09 < modd:#liferay> would be nice to see it at your market place^^
