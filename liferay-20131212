08:20 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I honestley regret using Liferay by now.
08:20 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> We would have been better off with Wordpress or even statis HTML.

09:04 < hufg:#liferay> :-(
09:09 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> And I also get the feeling that I'm the only idiot trying to get a Liferay cluster running in the Amazon cloud.
09:14 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Feels like using staging is similar to being suicidal.
09:36 < hufg:#liferay> i can give you a script that prints liferay related quotes when you use your terminal
09:36 < hufg:#liferay> 500% morale boost
09:37 < hufg:#liferay> I love the smell of Liferay in the morning!
09:37 < hufg:#liferay> 'very nice
09:37 < hufg:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur: staging is a bit risky but local staging without migrations has worked for us so far
09:37 < hufg:#liferay> in GA2
09:37 < hufg:#liferay> remote staging is a baaad mistake
09:39 < hufg:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/825713844e351e175531 run that script on bashrc, single 500% morale boost every day
09:40 < hufg:#liferay> no need for echo on line 17 :(
09:52 < jardineworks:#liferay> hufg, hahah .. awesome
09:52 < jardineworks:#liferay> you should easter egg this into your deployment.
09:52 < hufg:#liferay> yes :D
10:08 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I just tried disabling staging.
10:08 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Just for fun.
10:08 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> It broke my entire local setup. :D
10:43 < timmy_:#liferay> hello
10:46 < timmy_:#liferay> is it possible to publish content with default "guest view" permission?
