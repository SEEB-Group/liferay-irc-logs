06:59 < netspoof:#liferay> Hi, what's the best version of liferay that work with Jboss EAP 6 and Jboss 7.1.1 AS
07:01 < modd_:#liferay> try to use always the latest version
17:44 < Naenyn:#liferay> Can one hook have multiple service wrappers within it?
17:45 < Naenyn:#liferay> if they each have their own hook tag in liferay-hook.xml ?
18:26 < Naenyn:#liferay> Looks like it can, but for some reason my UserLocalServiceWrapper implementation of addUser is never being called. =\
19:31 < Naenyn:#liferay> .. solved! =]
