09:19 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> hi there
09:21 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> our "1 week problem" still unresolved =( : ClassCastException on com.liferay.portlet.PortletPreferencesWrapper. Something bad seems to happen when we deploy a portlet with PortletPreferences call. Might be linked to our new environnment (64bits instead of 32 before).
09:27 < NutsPT:#liferay> Hi ppl, we are trying to publish progamaticly a journal article trough our workflow and auto-approve it
09:27 < NutsPT:#liferay> we use this
09:27 < NutsPT:#liferay> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/b8511ffa7d61d168c944
09:27 < NutsPT:#liferay> can someone give us a hint?
09:27 < NutsPT:#liferay> please :)
10:08 < jardineworks:#liferay> NutsPT, ... and it's not working?
10:08 < NutsPT:#liferay> nop
10:08 < jardineworks:#liferay> NutsPT, is the status set correctly in the database?
10:08 < NutsPT:#liferay> let me check
10:11 < NutsPT:#liferay> yeps, both versions are 0
10:11 < NutsPT:#liferay> state
10:11 < NutsPT:#liferay> status at 0 on the JournalArticle table
10:13 < jardineworks:#liferay> NutsPT, ok -- and how are you trying to retrieve it?
10:13 < jardineworks:#liferay> OOTB portlet? custom portlet? search query?
10:14 < NutsPT:#liferay> OOTB Asset Publisher
10:15 < NutsPT:#liferay> addJournalArticle method also notifies the appropriate model listeners.
10:15 < NutsPT:#liferay> so when we create a new version, it works.. weird
10:16 < NutsPT:#liferay> this ones donâ€™t notify:
10:16 < NutsPT:#liferay> addArticle
10:16 < NutsPT:#liferay> updateJournalArticle
10:16 < NutsPT:#liferay> can this be it?
10:37 < jardineworks:#liferay> NutsPT,
10:37 < jardineworks:#liferay> sorry
10:37 < jardineworks:#liferay> was away
10:38 < jardineworks:#liferay> could be that the search index is not updating
10:38 < jardineworks:#liferay> are you explicitly adding it to the asset publisher?
10:38 < jardineworks:#liferay> or are you getting it as part of a search result?
10:40 < NutsPT:#liferay> ok, so neither
10:41 < NutsPT:#liferay> we publish and the new ones should appear
10:41 < NutsPT:#liferay> we are also checking in content in the control panel
10:41 < NutsPT:#liferay> and the state is approved but not appearing
10:42 < NutsPT:#liferay> the asset publisher is configured to show all those kind of articles
10:42 < NutsPT:#liferay> can we reinforce indexing or something ?
11:03 < jardineworks:#liferay> NutsPT, you shouldn't have to, it should be reindexing as part of the save process
11:03 < jardineworks:#liferay> but one way to validate -- assuming that the index is even the issue
11:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> in the Server Administration, increase the log level to ALL for the LuceneIndexWriter class
11:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> com.liferay.portal.search.lucene.LuceneIndexWriter
11:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> and then do it again and see if there is a debug statement in the log.
11:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> you could also install Luke (lucene Luke) and use it to browse the search index.
11:07 < NutsPT:#liferay> ok, where on test now, be right back with more info
