08:08 < d-tail:#liferay> Hi all! Is there any way to reset a single portlet session variable on every page load (not ajax requests, though)
08:09 < d-tail:#liferay> I'm trying to share data between ajaxable portlets through portlet session, but I don't want to store the data between "real" page loads
08:35 < modd_:#liferay> jhf: using portletConfig helped but I can't use it in my localservice as it's not related to genericportlet. :\
