08:08 < d-tail:#liferay> Hi all! Is there any way to reset a single portlet session variable on every page load (not ajax requests, though)
08:09 < d-tail:#liferay> I'm trying to share data between ajaxable portlets through portlet session, but I don't want to store the data between "real" page loads
08:35 < modd_:#liferay> jhf: using portletConfig helped but I can't use it in my localservice as it's not related to genericportlet. :\

16:49 < Naenyn:#liferay> jhf: any idea when rotty will be back? =]
16:50 <@jhf:#liferay> Naenyn: not entirely sure, I know he's been traveling.  I'll let him know he's sought after :)
16:50 < Naenyn:#liferay> thanks! =]
16:50 < Naenyn:#liferay> I have hook questions!
16:52 < barrie_:#liferay> anyone ever get this when trying to enable security on Tomcat?
16:52 < barrie_:#liferay> Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: CE
16:52 < barrie_:#liferay> Caused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: CE
16:52 < barrie_:#liferay>         at java.net.URLClassLoader$1.run(URLClassLoader.java:202)
16:54 <@jhf:#liferay> that IS bizarre
16:54 < barrie_:#liferay> if I don't use the -security switch .. all is fine.
16:55 < barrie_:#liferay> On a Mac - Mavericks 10.9.2
16:55 < barrie_:#liferay> THis is with a liferay 6.2 CE GA2 bundle
16:56 < Naenyn:#liferay> jhf: on a side note.. if I had developer-related questions on how to implement something for one of my clients and wasn't able to find the answer here or on the forums, would it be appropriate to ask via Liferay's support ticketing system?
16:57 <@jhf:#liferay> if the client is an EE subscriber, then yes :)
16:58 < Naenyn:#liferay> That they are. Cool, I wasn't sure if I could use that for getting dev help or if it was just for dealing with production issues.
16:59 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah... client would need to give you login info for LESA (our EE subscriber ticketing system)
17:01 < Naenyn:#liferay> I think I already have access? I've already submitted plenty of tickets on their behalf for production-related issues. =]
17:01 <@jhf:#liferay> oh yeah then you're good to go. however, I THINK that if your question is more "how do I develop" you might get pitched on consultancy
17:02 <@jhf:#liferay> and I dunno if there is some kind of limit on the # of tickets you can file per unit of time..
17:02 < Naenyn:#liferay> Mmm.. it's more like questions on how things work that I can't find answers for in the documentation.
17:03 <@jhf:#liferay> well if something's not working as expected and there're no docs, I'd consider that a "bug" to some degree :)
17:03 < Naenyn:#liferay> For example, I'm having trouble telling what point(s) I can hook in to during the user creation process. I need to be able to, at the end of user creation, connect to an external system to do some magic and then update the newly created LR user accordingly.
17:03 < Naenyn:#liferay> I've found some documentation on the hook points available.. but it isn't clear to me where those exist in the flow.
17:04 < Naenyn:#liferay> I've gotten so used to saying, "I'll just go ask Ray on irc.." =]
17:06 < barrie_:#liferay> if you want to hook into user creation .. you can use a hook and implement a UserLocalServiceWrapper
17:06 <@jhf:#liferay> you can create a 'model listener hook' for the User model.. then put your code in the 'onAfterCreate' hook, and at the end, call something like UserLocalSeviceUtil.updateUser(user)
17:07 < barrie_:#liferay> Wrapper is a bit cleaner.. if you can use it..
17:12 < Naenyn:#liferay> What I was stuck on was knowing what to hook in to. the user model thing makes sense, but is there a list somewhere of what all the places are that can be .. hook-able? At one point I had a list (I think from portal.properties) but I can't seem to find it at the moment.
17:13 < Naenyn:#liferay> barrie_: regarding the wrapper, sort of the same question.. could you perhaps point me at an example wrapper?
17:13 < Naenyn:#liferay> As long as I can understand where and how to hook, I am good. =]
17:14 < Naenyn:#liferay> All of the hooks I've written so far have been jsp changes.. with one exception.. a post login hook. Hm, need to look at that one again.
