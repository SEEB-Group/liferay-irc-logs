02:24 < hufg_:#liferay> jardineworks: you need to set permissions for(some) custom attributes
02:29 < hufg_:#liferay> perhaps even all custom fields

05:11 < hufg_:#liferay> rotty3000: minifier filter needs a major rework
05:11 < hufg_:#liferay> it caches per request which is nuts
05:11 < bjornjohansson:#liferay> Someone who has experience with open office and liferay?
05:12 < hufg_:#liferay> and the limited file cache does not work(???)
05:12 < bjornjohansson:#liferay> My soffice crasch from time to time and thus breaking the function of creating previews, downloading pdfs etc from the document portlet
05:12 < hufg_:#liferay> it filled a 10G /tmp like nothiing
05:16 < hufg_:#liferay> maybe remove dynamicssfilter and minifierfilter
05:16 < hufg_:#liferay> they suck
05:16 < hufg_:#liferay> 8)
07:02 < hufg_:#liferay> provide all liferay css precompiled/js minified disable both filters make them optional
07:02 < hufg_:#liferay> easy work!
08:12 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Mhm?
08:12 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I don't even want to hear anything about compiled or minified CSS/JS any more.
08:12 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> So much hassle...
10:49 < hufg_:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur: i  may be wrong there may be a flaw in the tests but anyways we still would like to disable the filters
10:49 < hufg_:#liferay> but it's haard
10:52 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> It sure is.
10:53 < wednesday_questi:#liferay> Clustered Liferay 6.1GA2; configured with Solr index system. Setting "index.on.startup=true" on all nodes forces re-index; but is this done on all the nodes' startup? If so, I should definitely not.
10:56 < jardineworks:#liferay> hufg_,  your comment earlier about the minifier... was that just for css or for the js as well?
11:14 < hufg_:#liferay> both
11:14 < hufg_:#liferay> but it may be that the request params were wrong in the sense that this does not really happen
11:14 < hufg_:#liferay> the requests are recorded
11:14 < hufg_:#liferay> and it may be that they have been recorded with the wrong settings
11:15 < hufg_:#liferay> the thing is that our /tmp resides in san network disk and this will not change and we do not like those /tmp writes
11:15 < hufg_:#liferay> or reads
11:16 < hufg_:#liferay> wednesday_questi: yes yes i have seen it on my own eyes it tries to update on the cluster whether this actually works or not idk
11:16 < hufg_:#liferay> on startup
11:17 < hufg_:#liferay> with out index.on.startup
11:17 < hufg_:#liferay> or are you asking if index.on.startup=true on single node updates all, it does not work like taht
11:17 < hufg_:#liferay> or perhaps it does hehe
