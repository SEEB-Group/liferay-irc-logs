02:24 < hufg_:#liferay> jardineworks: you need to set permissions for(some) custom attributes
02:29 < hufg_:#liferay> perhaps even all custom fields

05:11 < hufg_:#liferay> rotty3000: minifier filter needs a major rework
05:11 < hufg_:#liferay> it caches per request which is nuts
05:11 < bjornjohansson:#liferay> Someone who has experience with open office and liferay?
05:12 < hufg_:#liferay> and the limited file cache does not work(???)
05:12 < bjornjohansson:#liferay> My soffice crasch from time to time and thus breaking the function of creating previews, downloading pdfs etc from the document portlet
05:12 < hufg_:#liferay> it filled a 10G /tmp like nothiing
05:16 < hufg_:#liferay> maybe remove dynamicssfilter and minifierfilter
05:16 < hufg_:#liferay> they suck
05:16 < hufg_:#liferay> 8)
07:02 < hufg_:#liferay> provide all liferay css precompiled/js minified disable both filters make them optional
07:02 < hufg_:#liferay> easy work!
08:12 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Mhm?
08:12 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I don't even want to hear anything about compiled or minified CSS/JS any more.
08:12 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> So much hassle...
10:49 < hufg_:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur: i  may be wrong there may be a flaw in the tests but anyways we still would like to disable the filters
10:49 < hufg_:#liferay> but it's haard
10:52 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> It sure is.
10:53 < wednesday_questi:#liferay> Clustered Liferay 6.1GA2; configured with Solr index system. Setting "index.on.startup=true" on all nodes forces re-index; but is this done on all the nodes' startup? If so, I should definitely not.
10:56 < jardineworks:#liferay> hufg_,  your comment earlier about the minifier... was that just for css or for the js as well?
11:14 < hufg_:#liferay> both
11:14 < hufg_:#liferay> but it may be that the request params were wrong in the sense that this does not really happen
11:14 < hufg_:#liferay> the requests are recorded
11:14 < hufg_:#liferay> and it may be that they have been recorded with the wrong settings
11:15 < hufg_:#liferay> the thing is that our /tmp resides in san network disk and this will not change and we do not like those /tmp writes
11:15 < hufg_:#liferay> or reads
11:16 < hufg_:#liferay> wednesday_questi: yes yes i have seen it on my own eyes it tries to update on the cluster whether this actually works or not idk
11:16 < hufg_:#liferay> on startup
11:17 < hufg_:#liferay> with out index.on.startup
11:17 < hufg_:#liferay> or are you asking if index.on.startup=true on single node updates all, it does not work like taht
11:17 < hufg_:#liferay> or perhaps it does hehe
11:18 < hufg_:#liferay> find the spot where the cluster gets updated and debug and tell me what happens?!
11:22 < wednesday_questi:#liferay> Thanks hufg_ ; right, I meant "index.on.startup" on all nodes;
11:23 < wednesday_questi:#liferay> hufg_: and the related piece of code is this:  https://t.seebgroup.com/github-liferay-lucene-helper-reindex-method
11:24 < wednesday_questi:#liferay> com.liferay.portal.search.lucene.LuceneIndexer.reindex()
11:28 < jardineworks:#liferay> hufg_, hmmm right now we have the dynamic css setting disabled because we have been having issues with it. We have the js one turned on, but I haven't done any resource monitoring to make sure that nothing whacky is happening. Now you have me concerend :)
11:28 < wednesday_questi:#liferay> hufg_: another way to do same thing is this : com.liferay.portal.search.lucene.LuceneHelperUtil.startup(long)
11:30 < wednesday_questi:#liferay> Tagging this discussion for log searcher: #indexing #clustered #solr
11:35 < Slagwag:#liferay> hmm anyone ever use Bloomfire? i keep seeing it on liferay websites
11:35 < Slagwag:#liferay> as an alternative
11:35 < Slagwag:#liferay> but it seems too well reviewed
11:53 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Wow. Odd. Did any of you ever encountered an exception that the class SAXParser could not be found?
11:53 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> One of our custom portlets causes this exception.
11:53 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I can't understand how that is possible. XML parsing is done everywhere in Liferay. How can the SAXParser not be available all of a sudden?
11:55 < wednesday_questi:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, check the global classpath ${CATALINA_HOME}/lib/ext/ and portlet's class path ${PORTLET_DIR}/WEB-INF/lib ; if not there, then need to put in plugin'- properties to request that jar from portal's lib.
11:57 < wednesday_questi:#liferay> Slagwag:  don't know since Bloomfire not opensource.
11:59 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> wednesday_questi: Which jar would that be? sax2.jar or something else?

13:39 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey jhf -- do you know where I can find the schema for the lucene index OOTB?
13:45 <@jhf:#liferay> jardineworks: hmmmm
13:45 <@jhf:#liferay> nope, do not.. rotty3000 would know though.
13:46 <@jhf:#liferay> also, I'm not a search expert. I didn't even know there was a schema :)
13:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, I want to see what fields are on a record so I can see what is "searchable". Tags and categories in particular :)
13:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> I assume they are, but curiosity is now betting the better of me
13:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> rotty3000, looks like he is away
13:47 <@jhf:#liferay> i'll look around the source and see if there's an obvious lucene_schema_for_liferay.<something>
13:47 <@jhf:#liferay> :)
13:48 < jardineworks:#liferay> haha
13:48 < jardineworks:#liferay> all I found was the spring config
13:54 <@jhf:#liferay> jardineworks: https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/blob/master/portal-service/src/com/liferay/portal/kernel/search/Field.java ?
13:54 <@jhf:#liferay> these seem to be used when indexing content, e.g. in the blogs portlet: https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/blob/master/portal-impl/src/com/liferay/portlet/blogs/util/BlogsIndexer.java#L98
13:54 <@jhf:#liferay> some docs on using fields for searching here: https://www.liferay.com/documentation/liferay-portal/6.2/user-guide/-/ai/searching-for-content-in-liferay-liferay-portal-6-2-user-guide-06-en
13:55 <@jhf:#liferay> from there: "Note: You can identify available indexed fields by enabling the Search portlet’s Display Results in Document Form configuration setting and then expanding individual results by clicking the + symbol to the left of their titles."
13:56 <@jhf:#liferay> oh sweet
13:56 <@jhf:#liferay> you should try that
13:56 <@jhf:#liferay> add search portlet to a page, go to its configuration, turn on "show results in document form"
13:56 <@jhf:#liferay> then search for something
13:56 <@jhf:#liferay> there's a little + button next to each result showing all the fields for that type of document
13:57 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, is this 6.2 specific?
13:57 < jardineworks:#liferay> i am on 6.1.2
13:57 <@jhf:#liferay> hmm
13:58 <@jhf:#liferay> possibly. i did this on 6.2. lemme check 6.1. is there no such option there?
13:58 < jardineworks:#liferay> one sec
13:58 < jardineworks:#liferay> lemme see
13:58 <@jhf:#liferay> I see this for 6.2: http://i.imgur.com/CU8RS6q.png
14:02 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf,  is the search portlet the one under tools? or is this supposed to be the web content search?
14:02 <@jhf:#liferay> the one under tools.. the generic search one.
14:02 < jardineworks:#liferay> shoot -- I added it but I am not getting any handles on it ( to remove it, or to configure it)
14:02 <@jhf:#liferay> checking 6.1 docs..
14:03 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah it should be in 6.1 too https://www.liferay.com/documentation/liferay-portal/6.1/user-guide/-/ai/lp-6-1-ugen05-using-faceted-search-0
14:03 <@jhf:#liferay> do you have 'edit controls' turned on?
14:03 < jardineworks:#liferay> i do
14:03 < jardineworks:#liferay> weird
14:03 < jardineworks:#liferay> now I can't remove it hhaaha
14:03 < jardineworks:#liferay> burn
14:03 <@jhf:#liferay> heh
14:03 <@jhf:#liferay> do you see the config (wrench) for other portlets on that page?
14:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> yeah -- the others I add I can see the handles
14:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> aha!
14:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> hahah
14:04 <@jhf:#liferay> that is odd. perhaps your theme is messing with it?
14:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> the labels are white and they are inside the text field (with a white bg)
14:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> need my ghost pen
14:04 <@jhf:#liferay> nice
14:06 < jardineworks:#liferay> so I enbale this -- "Display Results in Document Form "
14:06 < jardineworks:#liferay> then do a search?
14:06 <@jhf:#liferay> yep. and each "hit" will have a little + button next to it
14:07 < jardineworks:#liferay> awesome!
14:07 <@jhf:#liferay> click the + and it shows each field used to index that particular doc type
14:07 <@jhf:#liferay> that's how you find out which fields can be used to search for specific doc types..
14:07 <@jhf:#liferay> guess there's no giant xml somewhere that lists them all... it's in the java code.
14:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> this is sweet. Thanks man :)
14:09 <@jhf:#liferay> n/p have fun!
15:08 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey jhf -- I have another question for you :)
15:09 <@jhf:#liferay> k
15:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> I have a structure that has a field -- "isFeatured" which is a true/false. In the index the value that is being written contains the instance value --
15:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> web_content/article_is_featured/LlUKX8wY:true
15:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> for example
15:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> do you know if it is possible to wildcard part of the saerch term?
15:10 <@jhf:#liferay> ehh.. nope, I've no idea :( that's definitely a rotty3000 question
15:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> where is that guy?! playin hookie?
15:54 < jardineworks:#liferay> does anyone know where rotty is?
15:54 < jardineworks:#liferay> :)
15:54 <@jhf:#liferay> dunno.. may just be off today.. I don't think he's on holiday.
21:55 <@jhf:#liferay> rotty3000 or rotty30001 ?
