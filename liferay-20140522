05:29 < modd_> hi. did someone already use url rewriting? I'd like to change a url from host/web/sitename/pagename to host/sitename/parentpagename/pagename - so basically I want to add parent pages of a page into the url
05:36 < topolik> modd_: if you are on 6.2 try to look at LayoutFriendlyURLLocalServiceImpl
05:37 < modd_> yep, 6.2
05:40 < modd_> am I supposed to override addLayoutFriendlyURL methods and simply add the friendlyURL of the parent page to whatever gets saved?
05:40 < modd_> I found this old post: http://www.liferay.com/de/community/forums/-/message_boards/message/29170097 - he's doing something similiar, just on another class
09:24 < jardineworks> does anyone know if there is an easy way to set the order of the related asset items assigned to a piece of content?
