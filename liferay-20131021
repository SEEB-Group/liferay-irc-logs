07:44 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> is there a way to get the list of all sites accessible to a user in a custom portlet?
07:46 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> nevermind, got it ;)
09:22 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> hi, i created a configuration page for my portlet following https://www.liferay.com/community/wiki/-/wiki/Main/Add+Config+Page+to+Plugin+Portlet#section-Add+Config+Page+to+Plugin+Portlet-Specify+your+Config+Action+Impl  but how can i get the stored preference in the view mode from this?
10:22 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> avinashrbhat: Did you manage to solve your problem already?
10:43 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> yes
10:43 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> :-)
10:44 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, using PortalUtil.getPreferences(request) i got it finally.
15:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey topolik are you around?
15:22 < topolik:#liferay> hi jardineworks yes
15:22 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik, got a second for a question?
15:22 < topolik:#liferay> I try to
15:22 < jardineworks:#liferay> I have a hook that adds property keys to the language bundle that I use in my theme.
15:23 < jardineworks:#liferay> If I am the GUEST user it works without issue. As soon as I log in though all I see are the keys.
15:23 < jardineworks:#liferay> have you come across that one before?
15:24 < topolik:#liferay> hmm, never before
15:25 < topolik:#liferay> do you provide also a default locale bundle?
15:25 < jardineworks:#liferay> I was wondering if maybe that was it.
15:25 < topolik:#liferay> and locale variations?
15:25 < jardineworks:#liferay> I think I have only en right now
15:25 < jardineworks:#liferay> (checking)
15:25 < topolik:#liferay> to be honest, I don't know how the locale fallback works when using hooks
15:26 < topolik:#liferay> but I'd try to provide also default locale bundle
15:26 < jardineworks:#liferay> right
15:26 < topolik:#liferay> in the worst case you'll have to debug it
15:26 < jardineworks:#liferay> yeah, I have only en. Let me copy it to just a Langueage.properties and see if that fixes it.
15:27 < topolik:#liferay> jardineworks: I'm going to bed, I hope it helps you. Anyway, ping me tomorrow with the result and we look at it in case it wont' work, thx!
15:30 < jardineworks:#liferay> k thanks. g'night
