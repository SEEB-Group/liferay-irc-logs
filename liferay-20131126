04:44 < hufg:#liferay> kermitt: see marketplace
04:59 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Good morning.
05:00 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Do you guys know what Liferay does when you provide all the JDBC connection settings instead of a JDBC pool name?
05:00 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Does Liferay create it's own connection pool?
05:00 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Because it looks like our Liferay opens way too many connections to the DB.
05:12 < hufg:#liferay> goood morning
05:35 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Never mind. I found it.
06:27 < hufg:#liferay> i have a wicked problem with load balancer in front all redirects "fail" in liferay, 302 just doesn't happen and this affects the usability of the admin ui
06:27 < hufg:#liferay> seems pretty far fetched that liferay has this kind of a bug
06:29 < hufg:#liferay> essentially it's implying the host from request has some effect on liferay behavious
06:29 < hufg:#liferay> behaviour
06:29 < hufg:#liferay> doubt it :Z
06:43 < hufg:#liferay> i take that back
06:43 < hufg:#liferay> :D
06:55 < hufg:#liferay> there are some lfieray security settings in play here
06:59 < hufg:#liferay> no bug, feature!
07:45 < jardineworks:#liferay> hufg, Tar-Minyatur -- have you guys encountered the bug where portlets in a custom them execute their render method multtiple times on one load?
07:45 < hufg:#liferay> no
07:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> I suppose it would depend how many, if any, logging statements you have in your render method :)
07:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> I have a custom carousel portlet that loads 5 times!
07:47 < jardineworks:#liferay> https://issues.liferay.com/browse/LPS-40984
07:47 < jardineworks:#liferay> its listed as a minor big, but I would call it a little more severe than minor.
07:58 < hufg:#liferay> hmm portlets in a custom theme
07:58 < hufg:#liferay> you mean a portlet instantied in theme
07:59 < hufg:#liferay> that is very strange
07:59 < hufg:#liferay> we don't have a logging policy that would catch this
08:01 < hufg:#liferay> doesn't seem too legit
08:01 < hufg:#liferay> you can see sass failures in the linked forum post
08:04 < hufg:#liferay> anything is possible though but the correlation of custom theme and "duplicate" render request calls is a bit far fetched imho
08:05 < hufg:#liferay> have you tried using the classic theme?
08:07 < hufg:#liferay> i'm not saying you don't have problems just that the issue is very weak and lacks any insight, same for the forum post
08:32 < gruntz:#liferay> Hi. There's a bunch of tutorials how to setup liferay's tomcat with oracle xe database, but merely none which metions how to do this with liferay+jboss7 bundle, any useful links or hints will be very much appreciated!
08:48 < hufg:#liferay> doesn't the user guide have instructions for every applicatio nserver
08:48 < hufg:#liferay> then you have to figure out how to create jdbc resources for oracle in jboss7
08:54 < hufg:#liferay> with jboss7+bundle your only trouble is to configure jdbc resources
08:54 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Mhm. Does anyone know what Liferay uses to build portlet.css?
08:54 < hufg:#liferay> without looking i'm saying sass
08:54 < hufg:#liferay> or what do you mean?
08:54 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Yes. I guess so.
08:54 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> But where is the original.
08:55 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> There are loads of definitions in there, which I can't find anywhere.
08:55 < hufg:#liferay> the styled theme is the original
08:55 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> And the portlet.css only appears in the target/ folder.
08:55 < hufg:#liferay> at least in 6.1 there are three themes, styled, unstyled and classic
08:55 < hufg:#liferay> styled has admin ui styles predefined, unstyled has nothing(LOL) and classic is the showcase
08:55 < hufg:#liferay> so you derive your theme from unstyled which has the portlet.css
08:56 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> So I should be able to override some if the stuff and SASS will merge it with the original file from the classic theme?
08:56 < hufg:#liferay> then because maven plugin is so shitty you let DynamicCssFilter compile it to sass at runtime
08:56 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> *of
08:56 < hufg:#liferay> yes and how this happens totally depends on your theme b uild
08:56 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay>  Mhm. My maven build seems to generate the portlet.css...
08:57 < hufg:#liferay> yes but it's still shitty, don't argue with me man!
08:57 < hufg:#liferay> 8)
08:57 < hufg:#liferay> you can't precompile sass with maven theme plugin 6.1.1
08:57 < hufg:#liferay> which means you either create your own compile and stab it into the heart of liferay maven theme plugin or let DynamicCssFilter do it's business
08:58 < hufg:#liferay> anyways just copy portlet.css to the same path, my understanding is that this will override the original
09:01 < gruntz:#liferay> hufg: thanks for help.
09:02 < hufg:#liferay> hmm /css/portlet.css
09:02 < hufg:#liferay> is the path
09:02 < hufg:#liferay> copy paste from original source, modify and hope the maven plugin compiles your sass and you are done
09:02 < hufg:#liferay> oh no scratch that i already forgot about dynamiccssfilter
09:02 < hufg:#liferay> no compiling
09:03 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Ok. I'll try that. Thanks.
09:05 < hufg:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur: the maven plugin "overlays" the parent theme into your theme and keeps your files that are overlapping
09:05 < hufg:#liferay> or thats how it's supposed to work
09:06 < jardineworks:#liferay> hufg, I haven't actually dug into it yet to be honest ... I was just curious if anyone else has seen it too. Next week I am hoping to get to it.
09:06 < hufg:#liferay> hehe yeah
09:06 < jardineworks:#liferay> I'll let  you know if I find anything out
09:06 < jardineworks:#liferay> for now, the site still responds fast enough.
09:06 < hufg:#liferay> someone bought us shitty machines
09:07 < hufg:#liferay> no speed for me
09:07 < hufg:#liferay> !!
09:07 < jardineworks:#liferay> and it's not consistent as an issue which is very disconcerting. I mean the carousel portlet nearly always does it, but there are instances where it does not. And then I have some other portlets that never do it at all.
09:07 < hufg:#liferay> some indians moving them transistors
09:07 < hufg:#liferay> mm yes that is strange
