04:59 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Good morning.
05:00 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Do you guys know what Liferay does when you provide all the JDBC connection settings instead of a JDBC pool name?
05:00 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Does Liferay create it's own connection pool?
05:00 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Because it looks like our Liferay opens way too many connections to the DB.
05:12 < hufg:#liferay> goood morning
05:35 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Never mind. I found it.
06:27 < hufg:#liferay> i have a wicked problem with load balancer in front all redirects "fail" in liferay, 302 just doesn't happen and this affects the usability of the admin ui
06:27 < hufg:#liferay> seems pretty far fetched that liferay has this kind of a bug
06:29 < hufg:#liferay> essentially it's implying the host from request has some effect on liferay behavious
06:29 < hufg:#liferay> behaviour
06:29 < hufg:#liferay> doubt it :Z
06:43 < hufg:#liferay> i take that back
06:43 < hufg:#liferay> :D
06:55 < hufg:#liferay> there are some lfieray security settings in play here
