04:59 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Good morning.
05:00 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Do you guys know what Liferay does when you provide all the JDBC connection settings instead of a JDBC pool name?
05:00 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Does Liferay create it's own connection pool?
05:00 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Because it looks like our Liferay opens way too many connections to the DB.
05:12 < hufg:#liferay> goood morning
