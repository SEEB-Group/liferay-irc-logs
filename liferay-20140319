06:15 < Alex_____:#liferay> hi! does anyone know how to delete the last private page? I get the error that I need at least one...
09:24 < Alex_____:#liferay> hi! does anyone know how to delete the last private page? I get the error that I need at least one...
10:57 < jardineworks:#liferay> Alex_____, sounds like you need at least one. What's the big deal with just having it?
10:57 < jardineworks:#liferay> I imagine that it is because you have to have at least one user, the admin right?
10:58 < jardineworks:#liferay> you can disable private pages altogether so that they are not used, but at least one must exist it seems.
11:11 < Alex_____:#liferay> jardineworks: thanks for your answer. The deal with having it is that it shows up on the users pulldown eventhough there is no private site
11:12 < Alex_____:#liferay> I just created a page for test reasons and now I can not get rid of it!
11:15 < Alex_____:#liferay> There are some suggestions on the forum but none worked for me
11:56 < jardineworks:#liferay> Alex_____, have you tried disabling private layouts?
11:56 < jardineworks:#liferay> private pages rater.
11:57 < jardineworks:#liferay> rather**
11:57 < jardineworks:#liferay> lol
11:57 < jardineworks:#liferay> not a good typing day for me apparently.
11:58 < jardineworks:#liferay> Alex_____, portal-ext property -- 	layout.user.private.layouts.enabled=false
11:58 < jardineworks:#liferay> that might hide the menu option altogether.
