09:29 <@jhf:#liferay> In about 30 minutes - hangout with jardineworks and discover real world Liferay search integration techniques - head over to #liferay-dev-life to join the discussion and join the live hangout at http://liferay.com/community/dev.life
09:29 <@jhf:#liferay> get the pre-hangout materials here: https://www.liferay.com/community/dev.life/upcoming-sessions
09:29 <@jhf:#liferay> no signup, no login, just good clean dev fun
09:41 < modd:#liferay> jhf: oh noes, typo: "Create cusom apps" ;)
09:42 <@jhf:#liferay> wow.. JIRA is broken big time
09:42 <@jhf:#liferay> modd: I have scheduled a meeting to discuss this typo
09:43 <@jhf:#liferay> we should have it fixed in a few weeks
09:43 <@jhf:#liferay> after UAT testing
09:43 < modd:#liferay> ^^
09:43 <@jhf:#liferay> :) fixed!
09:43 <@jhf:#liferay> does anyone else get big red ugly errors at issues.liferay.com ?
09:43 <@jhf:#liferay> I think there is some kind of cert issue too.
09:43 <@jhf:#liferay> maybe some CA cert expired last night
09:43 < modd:#liferay> nope, loads just fine
09:44 <@jhf:#liferay> what if you log in? can you search for issues?
09:44 <@jhf:#liferay> I type anything into the upper search box
09:44 <@jhf:#liferay> adn get a big red error
09:45 < modd:#liferay> login works but afterwards in almost every part of the page:
09:45 < modd:#liferay> An internal server error occurred when requesting resource.
09:45 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah exactly. ok. it's definitely broken.
09:46 < modd:#liferay> I'll have a look at the hangout later on yt
09:46 <@jhf:#liferay> \o/
11:07 < modd:#liferay> without any asset renderer, clicking on the link should fail
11:07 < modd:#liferay> so one have to add assetrenderer class and assetrendererfactory class
11:25 < modd:#liferay> ^^
11:26 < modd:#liferay> this will only work when it'S set to search in context
11:26 < modd:#liferay> thx, it was great, nice example :)
11:28 < jardineworks:#liferay> modd, thanks -- I never realized how much of a rabbit hole search could be lol
11:28 < jardineworks:#liferay> until I started prepping for this
11:29 < modd:#liferay> yeah, I had my experience too, as I tried to index data from an external database
11:30 < modd:#liferay> actually, I never finished the "search in context" part with the portletURL. using a simple asset renderer was enough so I wasn't digging deeper
11:31 < modd:#liferay> you could use the gistfile to create a blog entry on liferay.org so people will find it better and have a more "highlighted" view of it ;)
11:35 < jardineworks:#liferay> modd, true -- I  keep saying I am going to start a blog... and then never do. I should probably leverage Liferay since it is already there :)
11:40 < modd:#liferay> I think I will copy some of my blog entries to liferay.org, too, so it get's easier to find them
11:41 <@jhf:#liferay> \o/ on blogging!!
11:41 <@jhf:#liferay> if you do I will be sure to highlight them!
11:42 < modd:#liferay> well, for now it will only have some copies of my existing ones at athe ancud page
11:42 < modd:#liferay> the*
11:43 < modd:#liferay> and I have some portlets I want to release soon
12:30 < bijoo_:#liferay> Liferay DEV Life R0x; thanks for the session.
15:12 < modd:#liferay> liferay websites are currently sooo slow
16:39 < henriquev:#liferay> jhf: Jon Mak?
16:40 <@jhf:#liferay> nope -- James Falkner
16:41 < henriquev:#liferay> oh, sorry :)
