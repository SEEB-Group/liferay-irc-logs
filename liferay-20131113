03:24 < hufg:#liferay> maan
03:24 < hufg:#liferay> i have a crazy problem
03:25 < hufg:#liferay> a user is missing admin controls but it has the exact same user group and roles as a working user
03:25 < hufg:#liferay> an user
03:35 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Which controls are missing for him?
03:35 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Morning btw.
03:37 < hufg:#liferay> morning!
03:37 < hufg:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur: everything that counts
03:37 < hufg:#liferay> was unable to reproduce the problem so it's solved
03:37 < hufg:#liferay> very weird
03:37 < hufg:#liferay> create user -> add user group -> everything works
03:39 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Strange. I was going to suggest checking if there are any special site roles or something.
03:39 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I personally think that the permission system can be quite confusing.
04:43 < hufg:#liferay> yeah
05:16 < lesnick:#liferay> hi ia m new to liferay

07:42 < Jusle:#liferay> Hello. On the page http://www.liferay.com/documentation/liferay-portal/6.2/user-guide/-/ai/installing-liferay-on-tomcat-7-liferay-portal-6-2-user-guide-15-en is mentioned: "The Liferay .war file should be called liferay-portal-6.2.x-[date].war"
07:42 < Jusle:#liferay> But, on the additional files page, Download-button for the war-file does not give war file.
07:42 < Jusle:#liferay> for me
07:43 < lesnick:#liferay> i am getting mojoexecuton exception
07:43 < lesnick:#liferay> while trying to do mvn package
07:43 < lesnick:#liferay> build failed
07:44 < Jusle:#liferay> It downloads file liferay-portal-6.2.0-ce-ga1-20131101192857659.zip where I can't find the war file
07:44 < Jusle:#liferay> Have I missed something or is there some wrong link in Liferay.com?
08:21 < vsingleton:#liferay> lesnick: which package are you trying to build?
08:41 < hufg:#liferay> Jusle: http://sourceforge.net/projects/lportal/files/Liferay%20Portal/

10:00 < LRAdminInNeed32:#liferay> hi
10:00 < LRAdminInNeed32:#liferay> anybody know how to fix this error? Chat error: Liferay IMS is not connected to the Jabber server
10:04 < LRAdminInNeed32:#liferay> /nick anormallu
10:32 < imox1234:#liferay> Web Form is temporarily unavailable.
10:32 < imox1234:#liferay> I moved the lifray from another server to a new server
10:35 < jardineworks:#liferay> LRAdminInNeed32, look for the Instant Messenger section in the portal.properties and then provide your overrides in the portal-ext.properties
11:49 < jardineworks:#liferay> anyone around still?
12:29 < bradley_:#liferay> How do we figure out where JAVA_HOME= is
12:29 < apucay:#liferay> bradley, do i know you?
12:30 < apucay:#liferay> echo %JAVA_HOME% on windows
12:31 < bradley_:#liferay> this is bradley wood
12:31 < bradley_:#liferay> I'm on a mac
12:31 < npskirk:#liferay> I think the question is "how do I know where Liferay thinks JAVA_HOME is?"
12:32 < npskirk:#liferay> Which you can find by going to the control panel
12:32 < npskirk:#liferay> in "Server Administration"
12:32 < npskirk:#liferay> "Properties" tab
12:32 < apucay:#liferay> ah
12:32 < npskirk:#liferay> it is one of the env.* properties
12:34 < npskirk:#liferay> but if you want to know what your logged in user's JAVA_HOME is on mac, you can use terminal
12:35 < npskirk:#liferay> cat ENV | grep JAVA
12:35 < npskirk:#liferay> oops, just 'env
12:35 < npskirk:#liferay> 'env | grep JAVA'
12:35 < npskirk:#liferay> sorry, fat fingers this morning
12:38 < bradley_:#liferay> that doesn't seem to work
12:40 < apucay:#liferay> well if you just executed env on the command line you can see if it's set at all
12:41 < npskirk:#liferay> right
12:42 < npskirk:#liferay> if you do 'env' and there's no JAVA_HOME, then the user who typed 'env' doesn't have it set
12:42 < npskirk:#liferay> but the user's environment is probably not the environment that Liferay is running in anyway
12:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey jhf, question. My Portlet class calls a Util class I created (static method call). That method then makes a call to the PrefsPropsUtil. When this happens at runtime though I am getting a java.lang.IllegalAccessError: tried to access method ...
12:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, any idea why?
12:52 <@jhf:#liferay> what's the full IllegalAccessError message?
12:56 < jardineworks:#liferay> ill send it to you pvt to avoid the channel flood :)
18:35 < darkos:#liferay> hey there @jhf are you there?
