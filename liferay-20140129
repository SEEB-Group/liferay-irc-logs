08:08 < ferrema:#liferay> hi all
08:09 < ferrema:#liferay> i'm having a problem migrating a liferay 6.0.6 to 6.1.x
08:09 < ferrema:#liferay> namely
08:09 < ferrema:#liferay> it looks like there are some images missing for the image gallery
08:09 < ferrema:#liferay> and that's causing the migration to stop
08:10 < ferrema:#liferay> com.liferay.portlet.documentlibrary.NoSuchFileException: /home/ferrema/devel/migration/liferay-portal-6.1.2/data/document_library/0/0/11/95/119551.png/119551_1.0.png
08:10 < ferrema:#liferay> ...
08:10 < ferrema:#liferay> [more images missing]
08:10 < ferrema:#liferay> Stopping the server due to unexpected startup errors
08:10 < ferrema:#liferay> any idea on how to circumvent this ?
08:41 < Axxell:#liferay> hey guys, how do i get the latest file version of a file that is in the form of an assetentry
09:08 < modd_:#liferay> hi topolik: do you mind to have a look at this: https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/blob/master/portal-impl/src/com/liferay/portlet/expando/service/impl/ExpandoValueLocalServiceImpl.java?source=cc#L542 - I guess STRING_LOCALIZED is missing. I'm getting a string cannot convert to map
09:14 < modd_:#liferay> maybe it's a question for rotty3000, seems like he did write this class^^
09:21 < modd_:#liferay> STRING_ARRAY_LOCALIZED is missing, too
10:39 < topolik:#liferay> Hi modd_
10:39 < topolik:#liferay> I don't understand
10:41 < topolik:#liferay> looking at the code, STRING_LOCALIZED is not specified => liferay tries to cast the argument to Map<Locale, ?>, which should be a map with localized strings
10:44 < modd_:#liferay> the content of that field is something like {en_GB=foo;ja_JP=bar}
10:45 < modd_:#liferay> but it throws this error
10:45 < modd_:#liferay> we've solved it for now by adding that file to and ext and implementing it by ourself
10:54 < gok_:#liferay> hi channel for alloyui?
12:25 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey topolik... if I share a stacktrace with you, can you help me try to figure out the root cause?
12:25 < jardineworks:#liferay> I can't seem to find the problem
12:25 < jardineworks:#liferay> something inside Liferay is mad at me :)
12:55 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey rotty3000 -- are you around? I am looking at code with your name on it and have a security question if you are :)
