08:08 < ferrema:#liferay> hi all
08:09 < ferrema:#liferay> i'm having a problem migrating a liferay 6.0.6 to 6.1.x
08:09 < ferrema:#liferay> namely
08:09 < ferrema:#liferay> it looks like there are some images missing for the image gallery
08:09 < ferrema:#liferay> and that's causing the migration to stop
