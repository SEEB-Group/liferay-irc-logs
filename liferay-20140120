01:41 < Axxell:#liferay> Hey guys, trying today again to get to load journalcontent into my theme, ive done it before in velocity the same way its done in example two in this article http://www.e-kon.be/blog/item/two-ways-to-embed-web-content-in-liferay-themes
01:42 < Axxell:#liferay> ie. in velocity it looks like: #set ($footerContent = $journalContentUtil.getContent($group_id, $footerArticleId, null, "$locale", $theme_display))
01:43 < Axxell:#liferay> now im trying to do the same thing in freemarker, and cant get it to work, doing it like this <#assign footercontent = journalContentUtil.getContent(10194, "10982" ,"view","sv_SE",themeDisplay)/>
01:50 < Axxell:#liferay> there are 3 versions of getContent in JournalContentUtil, one which is static String	getContent(long groupId, String articleId, String viewMode, String languageId, ThemeDisplay themeDisplay)
02:22 < Axxell:#liferay> the error it gives is: No signature of method getContent matches the arguments, which would imply that there is a wrong number of arguments or something is of the wrong type
02:29 < Axxell:#liferay> any help would be appreciated
03:02 < Axxell:#liferay> ok, no more help needed.. two things wrong: freemarker does not know about null values they are instead just empty.., you can not assign an empty value to a variable, you need to handle if an method returns an empty value
03:03 < satheesh:#liferay> Axxell: You are able to retrieve article dynamically?
03:04 < Axxell:#liferay> satheesh: yeah
03:05 < Axxell:#liferay> satheesh: like this <#assign menucontent1 = journalContentUtil.getContent(axxellCompany, menucontentid1 ,"",locale,theme_display)!"no article with that id">
03:06 < Axxell:#liferay> satheesh: where axxellCompany is the site group id and mencontentid1 is the article id
03:07 < satheesh:#liferay> Axxell: got it. Congrats. If you using with categories, unit test under various scenario based on your requirement
05:30 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> hi there. I still have minify css problems, and I don't know why. forum post : http://tinyurl.com/kjk3y49. (theme.css.fast.load is set to true)
11:25 < cr3:#liferay> what's the password encryption used in liferay 6.1? I see in the 6.2 changelog that it was SHA, but I can't find in the documentation whether it used to be SHA1, 224, 256, etc.
11:27 < jihedamine:#liferay> Hi. I'm trying to upgrade from 6.0 EE to 6.1 GA3 EE, v6_0_12_to_6_1_0.UpgradeDocumentLibrary causes an exception "UpgradeException: com.mysql.jdbc.exceptions.jdbc4.MySQLSyntaxErrorException: Unknown column 'fileEntryId' in 'where clause'". Can anyone help with that please ?
11:33 <@jhf:#liferay> cr3: the default is now PBKDF2WithHmacSHA1/160/128000 generating 160 bit hashes using 128k rounds
11:33 <@jhf:#liferay> sorry that's for 6.2
11:34 <@jhf:#liferay> for 6.1 the default is SHA-1
11:34 <@jhf:#liferay> https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/blob/6.1.2-ga3/portal-impl/src/portal.properties#L3761
