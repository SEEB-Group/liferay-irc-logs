01:41 < Axxell:#liferay> Hey guys, trying today again to get to load journalcontent into my theme, ive done it before in velocity the same way its done in example two in this article http://www.e-kon.be/blog/item/two-ways-to-embed-web-content-in-liferay-themes
01:42 < Axxell:#liferay> ie. in velocity it looks like: #set ($footerContent = $journalContentUtil.getContent($group_id, $footerArticleId, null, "$locale", $theme_display))
01:43 < Axxell:#liferay> now im trying to do the same thing in freemarker, and cant get it to work, doing it like this <#assign footercontent = journalContentUtil.getContent(10194, "10982" ,"view","sv_SE",themeDisplay)/>
01:50 < Axxell:#liferay> there are 3 versions of getContent in JournalContentUtil, one which is static String	getContent(long groupId, String articleId, String viewMode, String languageId, ThemeDisplay themeDisplay)
02:22 < Axxell:#liferay> the error it gives is: No signature of method getContent matches the arguments, which would imply that there is a wrong number of arguments or something is of the wrong type
02:29 < Axxell:#liferay> any help would be appreciated
03:02 < Axxell:#liferay> ok, no more help needed.. two things wrong: freemarker does not know about null values they are instead just empty.., you can not assign an empty value to a variable, you need to handle if an method returns an empty value
03:03 < satheesh:#liferay> Axxell: You are able to retrieve article dynamically?
03:04 < Axxell:#liferay> satheesh: yeah
03:05 < Axxell:#liferay> satheesh: like this <#assign menucontent1 = journalContentUtil.getContent(axxellCompany, menucontentid1 ,"",locale,theme_display)!"no article with that id">
03:06 < Axxell:#liferay> satheesh: where axxellCompany is the site group id and mencontentid1 is the article id
03:07 < satheesh:#liferay> Axxell: got it. Congrats. If you using with categories, unit test under various scenario based on your requirement
05:30 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> hi there. I still have minify css problems, and I don't know why. forum post : http://tinyurl.com/kjk3y49. (theme.css.fast.load is set to true)
11:25 < cr3:#liferay> what's the password encryption used in liferay 6.1? I see in the 6.2 changelog that it was SHA, but I can't find in the documentation whether it used to be SHA1, 224, 256, etc.
11:27 < jihedamine:#liferay> Hi. I'm trying to upgrade from 6.0 EE to 6.1 GA3 EE, v6_0_12_to_6_1_0.UpgradeDocumentLibrary causes an exception "UpgradeException: com.mysql.jdbc.exceptions.jdbc4.MySQLSyntaxErrorException: Unknown column 'fileEntryId' in 'where clause'". Can anyone help with that please ?
11:33 <@jhf:#liferay> cr3: the default is now PBKDF2WithHmacSHA1/160/128000 generating 160 bit hashes using 128k rounds
11:33 <@jhf:#liferay> sorry that's for 6.2
11:34 <@jhf:#liferay> for 6.1 the default is SHA-1
11:34 <@jhf:#liferay> https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/blob/6.1.2-ga3/portal-impl/src/portal.properties#L3761
11:34 < cr3:#liferay> jhf: exactly what I was looking for, thanks so much!
11:35 <@jhf:#liferay> \o/ yer welcome!
11:48 < jihedamine:#liferay> I was able to debug and get more details: when upgrading from 6.0, 6.1 liferay doesn't find fileEntryId column in DLFileVersion table. This column was supposed to be added during schema upgrade but wasn't. My portal-ext.properties declares upgrade.processes with all the existing upgrade process versions (6_0_0 until 6_1_1)
16:28 < jardineworks:#liferay> lol -- jhf I just got something awesome
16:28 <@jhf:#liferay> oh?
16:28 < jardineworks:#liferay> I am creating a user and of course I WAS using Jan 1 1970 for the birthday
16:28 < jardineworks:#liferay> BUT
16:28 < jardineworks:#liferay> they want it to be blank until the user sets one in the profile
16:29 < jardineworks:#liferay> so I set the birthday to be 1, 1, 1 ... thinking there would be no one that is 2013 years old :)
16:29 < jardineworks:#liferay> in the control panel for the year? I have the option from -69 to 70
16:29 < jardineworks:#liferay> :)
16:29 < jardineworks:#liferay> B.C. baby?
16:30 <@jhf:#liferay> some religions believe in the afterlife.. so we wanted to take that into consideration.
16:31 < jardineworks:#liferay> haha
16:31 <@jhf:#liferay> :)
16:31 < jardineworks:#liferay> strange though that I can't NOT set a birthday
16:31 < jardineworks:#liferay> meh -- 1900 I guess will work.
16:31 < jardineworks:#liferay> anyone who is 114 years old probably isn't doing their shopping online ;)
16:31 <@jhf:#liferay> did you consider overriding the JSP to not show values for the fields unless it is > 1970 or something?
16:31 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah I remember some site asked for age verification, I put like 120, and they had some smart ass retort
16:31 <@jhf:#liferay> it was pretty funny
16:32 < jardineworks:#liferay> I am overriding the JSP ... but I have the frankenarchtiecture to deal with
17:55 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey jhf -- are you around for an ssl question?
17:55 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah..
17:55 <@jhf:#liferay> shoot
17:56 <@jhf:#liferay> whoops.. look at the time. gotta run! bbl
17:56 < jardineworks:#liferay> ok -- not exactly an area of expertise but jsut want to validate a couple things. 1. SSL is not a Liferay thing, its a tomcat thing 2. You cn set the entire portal to run using SSL but to piece meal it, some things ssl, some not, you need to wire that into the links 3. One approach rather than hardcoding links is to offload SSL at the proxy so the request up to the proxy and back is ssl, but the proxy to the tomcat is clear
17:56 <@jhf:#liferay> j/k
17:56 <@jhf:#liferay> :)
17:57 < jardineworks:#liferay> LOL
17:57 < jardineworks:#liferay> as.
17:57 < jardineworks:#liferay> ass.
17:57 < jardineworks:#liferay> lol
17:57 < jardineworks:#liferay> iw as totally just saying "wiat wait! I'm hitting enter!"
17:57 <@jhf:#liferay> yea you got it right
17:57 <@jhf:#liferay> you can frontend LR with apache, so that apache (and not tomcat) handles ALL ssl
17:57 < jardineworks:#liferay> ok -- but there is not "make this portlet secure and this one not" type config right?
17:57 <@jhf:#liferay> (and can even offload it to hardware for performance)
17:58 <@jhf:#liferay> that's the easiest thing to do
17:58 < jardineworks:#liferay> i've never seen it and can find no indication
17:58 <@jhf:#liferay> then apache<->tomcat connection is "in the clear" but it's totally private over local sockets
17:58 <@jhf:#liferay> nope, not without a lot of fancy apache and/or tomcat config
17:58 < jardineworks:#liferay> ok cool
17:59 < jardineworks:#liferay> jsut wanted to make sure the "normal" approach was still a valid one :D
17:59 < jardineworks:#liferay> thanks
17:59 <@jhf:#liferay> I mean, when you request a portal page, it is all transmitted to you either encrypted (ssl), or not.
17:59 <@jhf:#liferay> well I take that back
17:59 <@jhf:#liferay> you CAN have mixed content
17:59 <@jhf:#liferay> but it is not recommended
17:59 <@jhf:#liferay> and not really useful IMO given the processing and network speeds of today
17:59 < jardineworks:#liferay> sure ... and if you do that then you piss off the browsers. Particularly IE
17:59 <@jhf:#liferay> yep
17:59 <@jhf:#liferay> big time.
18:00 < jardineworks:#liferay> cool -- so the answer is "its someone elses responsibility " :)
18:00 < jardineworks:#liferay> i like it
18:00 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah!!
18:00 <@jhf:#liferay> we recently instituted this on liferay.com
18:00 <@jhf:#liferay> whenever you login, we will forcefully redirect any http to https
18:00 <@jhf:#liferay> even have an ssl CDN
18:00 <@jhf:#liferay> which is separate from the non-SSL one!
18:01 <@jhf:#liferay> but synced. I think.
18:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> but if the content is not "sensitive" then yo uare doing a lot of encrypting for nadda no?
18:01 <@jhf:#liferay> well when you are logged in, there are sensitive things in cookies that one may be able to exploit in ways we do not know about. and there are forms that need ssl.
18:02 <@jhf:#liferay> so it's not so much the content, but the other junk (cookies, form data, etc) that MAY be sensitive. but you are right we end up encrypting 90% of stuff that's not really "sensitive"
18:02 <@jhf:#liferay> but the alternative is too much of a headacke
18:02 <@jhf:#liferay> and increases attack surfaces
18:02 <@jhf:#liferay> so we just said screw it
18:02 <@jhf:#liferay> and went 100% ssl :)
18:03 <@jhf:#liferay> ok gotta bail for real.
18:03 <@jhf:#liferay> will be on tomorrow though! and we have new quarterly top contributors I'll be announcing tomorrow with great fanfare.
