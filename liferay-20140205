01:15 < Axxell:#liferay> hey guys, im having problems with liferay 6.1 and vaadin 6.7.4.. apparently IE11 doesnt like vaadin ajax loading itself
06:14 < ferrema:#liferay> good morning
06:14 < ferrema:#liferay> i am trying to integrate solr into liferay 6.1
06:15 < ferrema:#liferay> i *think* the liferay plugin for solr (forked from git, version 6.1.3) is linked with an out dated solr
06:16 < ferrema:#liferay> as far as I can understand latest stable solr is 4.6.1
06:17 < ferrema:#liferay> looking at the solr-web plugin I can see that the solr libs refer to solr 1.4.1
06:17 < ferrema:#liferay> this leads to errors when trying to index : Invalid version or the data in not in 'javabin' format
06:18 < ferrema:#liferay> which is likely due to the fact that solr-core and solr-solrj that the plugin refers to are the wrong version
06:19 < ferrema:#liferay> trying to merely update the jars leads to compilation problems (eg): ERROR in /home/ferrema/devel/liferay6.1/workspace/liferay-plugins/webs/solr-web/docroot/WEB-INF/src/com/liferay/portal/search/solr/server/SolrServerFactoryImpl.java (at line 22)
06:19 < ferrema:#liferay>     [javac] 	import org.apache.solr.client.solrj.SolrServer;
06:19 < ferrema:#liferay> so the question is :
06:19 < ferrema:#liferay> is there any chance to get an updated solr-web plugin ?
06:20 < ferrema:#liferay> alternatively : which version of apache-solr server is needed for liferay 6.1.3 ?
