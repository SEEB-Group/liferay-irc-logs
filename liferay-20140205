01:15 < Axxell:#liferay> hey guys, im having problems with liferay 6.1 and vaadin 6.7.4.. apparently IE11 doesnt like vaadin ajax loading itself
06:14 < ferrema:#liferay> good morning
06:14 < ferrema:#liferay> i am trying to integrate solr into liferay 6.1
06:15 < ferrema:#liferay> i *think* the liferay plugin for solr (forked from git, version 6.1.3) is linked with an out dated solr
