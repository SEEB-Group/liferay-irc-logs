05:51 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Morning.
05:51 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> hufg: Are you around?
06:38 < hufg:#liferay> yess!
06:38 < hufg:#liferay> hello
06:47 < LRAdminInNeed125:#liferay> sal
06:47 < LRAdminInNeed125:#liferay> esti?
06:47 < LRAdminInNeed125:#liferay> hello
06:48 < LRAdminInNeed125:#liferay> any body?
06:49 < hufg:#liferay> hello hello
06:49 < hufg:#liferay> whats up my main man
06:49 < Cadmus:#liferay> Hello LRAdminInNeed125, this channel can be quite quiet, but if you give a short overview of your problem I'm sure people do check here from time to time
06:51 < hufg:#liferay> hehe lradmininneed
06:51 < hufg:#liferay> pay me 100 euros i'll look at it for an hour!
06:52 < hufg:#liferay> or maybe that 125 is a bid for 125 euros?!
06:59 < hufg:#liferay> fucking incredible i bit a fork and chipped my tooth
07:00 < hufg:#liferay> any way to remedy it with a portlet? ehh ehh ehh
07:13 < topolik:#liferay> depends on the kind of your fork and what kind of chip you have now on your tooth ;)
07:27 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> hufg: I vaguely recall that you told me about using the web content search portlet standalone without integrating it into a page.
07:27 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> hufg: I can't find any documentation about that. Can you give me a hint please?
07:32 < hufg:#liferay> mm yes yes
07:34 < hufg:#liferay> <add-default-resource>true</add-default-resource> in liferay-portlet.xml tells liferay "yes you may invoke me without adding to page"
07:34 < hufg:#liferay> then you need to build the correct request path to invoke the right portlet and right "method"
07:35 < hufg:#liferay> you may hard code it or use the api for example PortletURLFactory
07:36 < hufg:#liferay> the PortletURLFactory.create basicly tells on which page to invoke it, which portlet and which phase
07:36 < hufg:#liferay> you probably want "RENDER_PHASE"
07:37 < hufg:#liferay> now what you want to do is to see which struts action to invoke and what parameters
07:37 < hufg:#liferay> there is no documentation, one way is to use the portlet on page and get the params
07:38 < hufg:#liferay> for example you may want to add p_p_state=maximized, p_p_mode=view and struts_action=/journal_content_search/search then search keywords as _77_keywords
07:38 < hufg:#liferay> notice the 77 it's the plid of the portlet
07:38 < hufg:#liferay> rest is for liferay
07:39 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Mhm. Somehow this sounds way more complicated than I had hoped.
07:39 < hufg:#liferay> the api call create will give you an auth token, probably most portlets wont work without an auth token
07:40 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Currently we have a search form in the theme.
07:40 < hufg:#liferay> it's actually very easy once you get the hang of it
07:40 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I wanted to change it to use the content search portlet instead.
07:41 < hufg:#liferay> for example if you wish to invoke the web content search portlet for current page
07:41 < hufg:#liferay> $search_url = $portletURLFactory.create($request, "77", $current_page_plid, "RENDER_PHASE"))
07:42 < hufg:#liferay> maybe change current_page_plid not sure whats the correct variable
07:42 < hufg:#liferay> then add p_p_state=maximized, p_p_mode=view and struts_action=/journal_content_search/search as hidden values to form and _77_keywords as form input
07:43 < hufg:#liferay> $search_url as form action
07:45 < hufg:#liferay> once the user clicks submit it will render the portlet on portal content area
07:45 < hufg:#liferay> the one where you drop your portlets etc
07:46 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Looks like the old form has only hardcoded values.
07:47 < hufg:#liferay> yes yes you can try that too i can't remember if you really need that auth token
07:47 < hufg:#liferay> p_p_auth
07:47 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> At least there is nothing in there and it used to work.
07:50 < hufg:#liferay> so ok  try to hardocde it first 8)
07:50 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Mmhm.
07:51 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> This is what I get when I use the portlet from a page: /web/guest/seiten-suche?p_p_id=77&p_p_lifecycle=0&p_p_state=maximized&p_p_mode=view&p_p_col_id=column-1&p_p_col_count=1&_77_struts_action=%2Fjournal_content_search%2Fsearch&_77_showListed=true
07:51 < hufg:#liferay> yes
07:52 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Funnily enough there is no keywords parameter in there.
07:53 < hufg:#liferay> you checked your post params?
07:53 < hufg:#liferay> i recommend chrome/chromium web dev tools for request inspection
07:53 < hufg:#liferay> firefox with firebug is ok
07:53 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Yeah. I prefer Chrome as well.
07:54 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Right. Keywords are submitted by post.
07:54 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Mhm.
07:55 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Okay. I can move that to GET as well. Nice.
07:55 < hufg:#liferay> yes
07:55 < hufg:#liferay> doesn't matter where they are
07:55 < hufg:#liferay> (probably) hehe
07:56 < hufg:#liferay> now with ninja skills you can track the rendering from struts action and so forth
07:56 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I could just put all these values into form fields now.
07:56 < hufg:#liferay> yes
07:56 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> But to me it looks like I still need to provide a page URL to attach these parameters to.
07:56 < hufg:#liferay> well yes
07:57 < hufg:#liferay> but the portlet doesn't need to be on that url
07:57 < hufg:#liferay> it just says to "render 77 portlet on that page"
07:57 < hufg:#liferay> it could be for example current page
07:57 < hufg:#liferay> or the front page
07:57 < hufg:#liferay> or a hidden page
07:57 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> When I replace the name of the page the portlet is on with home, I get an empty page.
07:58 < hufg:#liferay> params etc may be wrong or you need p_p_auth
07:58 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Oh well. I'll just leave that page up then.
07:58 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Doesn't matter anyway.
07:59 < hufg:#liferay> mm
07:59 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> As we don't have a dynamic menu it will not show up.
08:11 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Seems to be working.
10:11 < raydecampo:#liferay> I had some (dumb) questions concerning AlloyUI; first, how do I determine the version of AlloyUI being used with Liferay?
10:34 < dblessing:#liferay> raydecampo: which version of liferay are you talking about?
10:36 < raydecampo:#liferay> I have been prototyping on 6.1 but I see that 6.2 is out so I might switch
10:41 < dblessing:#liferay> 6.1 would be in the 1.5 alloy ui series. 6.2 is alloy 2.0 series
10:42 < raydecampo:#liferay> I assume the documentation on the alloy ui site is the latest version; is there a way to look at the documentation for a specific version?
10:43 < aj_:#liferay> has anyone ever had a problem where their theme would not deploy because more than one of the hot deployment classes was trying to do it?
10:43 < aj_:#liferay> I've never seen this one before.
10:43 < aj_:#liferay> hufg, you by any chance? now that we are on the same version? :)
10:44 < hufg:#liferay> hmh?
10:45 < hufg:#liferay> what happens when more than one of the hot deployment classes try to do it? 8)
10:45 < hufg:#liferay> doesn't ring a bell though
10:45 < aj_:#liferay> hufg, 5:38:14,843 ERROR [com.liferay.portal.kernel.deploy.auto.AutoDeployScanner][AutoDeployDir:246] com.liferay.portal.kernel.deploy.auto.AutoDeployException: The auto deploy listeners com.liferay.portal.deploy.auto.ThemeAutoDeployListener, com.liferay.portal.deploy.auto.WebAutoDeployListener all deployed /home/aj/projects/havas/sprouts/liferay/6.1.2ce/liferay-portal-6.1.2-ce-ga3/deploy/sprouts-web-v1-theme-6.1.2.1.war, but only one should have.

10:46 < hufg:#liferay> no idea :/
10:46 < hufg:#liferay> we ditched GA3 btw now at GA2
10:47 < aj_:#liferay> because of the publishing bug?
10:47 < aj_:#liferay> (aj_ = jardineworks)
10:53 < hufg:#liferay> hehe yeah figured
10:53 < hufg:#liferay> yes because of the publishing bug
11:01 < hufg:#liferay> maybe there is something strange in web.xml etc
11:02 < hufg:#liferay> had no problems deploying theme
11:02 < hufg:#liferay> actually had some problems with different paths from liferay api/init.vm
11:02 < aj_:#liferay> the weird thing is that I did deploy it.
11:02 < aj_:#liferay> Then I added a settings/> to disable the borders
11:03 < aj_:#liferay> tried to redeploy and it started with this nonsense
11:03 < hufg:#liferay> what does it look like your settings line?
11:04 < hufg:#liferay> i'm just about to leave anyways it should look like this <setting key="portlet-setup-show-borders-default" value="false" />
11:04 < hufg:#liferay> inside of settings tag
11:05 < hufg:#liferay> gtg bye!
11:07 < aj_:#liferay> that is what I have. Thanks anyway... have a good night!
11:47 < aj_:#liferay> WOW
11:47 < aj_:#liferay> AWESOME
11:47 < aj_:#liferay> best bug ever.
11:47 < aj_:#liferay> for anyone surfing the channel.
11:49 < aj_:#liferay> I had a theme where the name of the war file produced was xxx-web-v1-theme -- because it was the theme for the WEB version of the site. Logical name. It failed to deploy over and over with some nonsenes about how more than one hot deployer was tryign to roll it out. I checked the BaseHotDeployer class and if you look closely it determines the type of plugin based on the FILENAME (F A I L).
11:49 < aj_:#liferay> because I had both -web and -theme in my name, two separate deployer were trying to do the work.
11:49 < aj_:#liferay> awesome.
11:49 < aj_:#liferay> changed the name to xxx-v1-theme, worked.
12:47 < hufg1:#liferay> aj_: hehe neat find
12:47 < hufg1:#liferay> i have one also
12:48 < hufg1:#liferay> if you don't insert structure/template name with every language scheduled publishing breaks (ga2)
12:49 < hufg1:#liferay> a site with single language will survive this abomination of structures and templates!
12:49 < aj_:#liferay> ahha
12:49 < aj_:#liferay> awesome
12:58 < aj_:#liferay> yay! found another one. Create a private page in the control panel. Then change your mind and try to delete it. It won't let you, telling you that you have to have AT LEAST one page... even though when you started there were none.
13:36 < raydecampo:#liferay> I'
13:36 < raydecampo:#liferay> I'll try my alloy questions again: is there somewhere you can look at documentation for different versions?
13:37 < apucay1:#liferay> alloyui.com
13:37 < apucay1:#liferay> there is a version selector
13:38 < raydecampo:#liferay> apucay1: I am not seeing a version selector.  It says API Docs for Version 2.0.0 at the top but it is not selectable
13:38 < apucay1:#liferay> it's a drop down
13:38 < raydecampo:#liferay> Not what I am looking at
13:38 < raydecampo:#liferay> http://alloyui.com/api/
13:39 < apucay1:#liferay> alloyui.com
13:39 < apucay1:#liferay> look at the image
13:39 < apucay1:#liferay> the version is dropdown
13:40 < raydecampo:#liferay> Are we looking at the same thing?
13:40 < apucay1:#liferay> no, you are at /api, I am at /
13:40 < raydecampo:#liferay> OK, I see it at /
13:41 < raydecampo:#liferay> thanks
13:41 < apucay1:#liferay> ok
13:41 < raydecampo:#liferay> I was also wondering about the difference between YUI() and AUI(); the Rosetta stone uses AUI() but I didn't find it in the API
13:44 < raydecampo:#liferay> I see the rosetta stone refers to alloy ui 1.0.1 - so is AUI() no longer included in the API?
13:44 < dblessing:#liferay> It was AUI() in liferay 6.1. Looks like now it's just YUI()
13:47 < raydecampo:#liferay> what does that mean for things which differed between YUI() and AUI() in the rosetta stone?  Use the AUI() version but with YUI()?  Use either?
13:49 < dblessing:#liferay> AFAIK the rosetta stone was pre-alloy 2.0.  So if you're using Liferay 6.1 then follow that guide explicitly. If using Liferay 6.2 or Alloy 2.0 then who knows :)
14:09 < raydecampo:#liferay> Here's a non-alloy question - I have liferay running on jboss.  Do I need to go through the liferay autodeployer for liferay to properly recognize everything or is it OK to use jboss's built in deploy mechanisms?
14:21 < aj_:#liferay> raydecampo, never tried that but I remember reading soemthing about how you should never copy war directly into webapps that you should always use Liferays auto deploy mechanism becuase it "does stuff"
14:22 < aj_:#liferay> I've had situations before where I needed to scrub records from the database to get a deploy to work. that to me means that there are probably scenarios where the data layer is checked,
14:22 < aj_:#liferay> I would stick with Liferays if I were you
15:11 < raydecampo:#liferay> aj_: thanks
