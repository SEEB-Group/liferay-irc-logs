02:52 < modd_:#liferay> hi
02:52 < modd_:#liferay> anyone using lr 6.2?
02:53 < modd_:#liferay> what does the Manualcheckinrequired expando do and do I need it or is it save to remove it?
06:13 < modd_:#liferay> dynamic data lists are broken..I can't choose a definition, they simply don't show up
06:20 < dblessing:#liferay> modd_: are you using a custom theme by chance?
06:20 < modd_:#liferay> nope, lr 6.2 ga1
06:20 < modd_:#liferay> vanilla
06:20 < dblessing:#liferay> hmm interesting. i tested that yesterday with classic theme and all worked well
06:21 < modd_:#liferay> classic? is it the blue/white one now?^^
06:21 < dblessing:#liferay> yeah
06:21 < modd_:#liferay> I can add new data definition, but trying to choose one will show no entries
06:22 < modd_:#liferay> and I don't think it's about permissions, because I'm logged in as admin user
06:22 < dblessing:#liferay> that's odd. i definitely did that
06:22 < modd_:#liferay> the permissions for the login portlet are also buggy
06:23 < modd_:#liferay> usually I define it to be visibile for guests but not for users
06:23 < modd_:#liferay> but as a normal user I can see it
06:24 < modd_:#liferay> maybe it's affected by another role..
06:24 < dblessing:#liferay> hmm i didn't know you could do that. i thought permissions were always additive - as in whatever guest has, user also has by default
06:25 < modd_:#liferay> nope, you can define everything on base of every role
06:25 < dblessing:#liferay> nice
06:26 < modd_:#liferay> but sadly, it doesn't work anymore :\
06:26 < modd_:#liferay> why liferay, why do you add 10 bugfixes and 11 bugs..why? ^^
06:26 < dblessing:#liferay> haha welcome to GA1
06:27 < dblessing:#liferay> i was actually quite surprised by the release
06:27 < modd_:#liferay> yeah, it seems buggy
06:28 < dblessing:#liferay> i'm also disappointed that they didn't upgrade to bootstrap 3. now they're a full year behind in bootstrap features…and i'm betting it won't ever see 6.2
06:29 < modd_:#liferay> on asset publisher config one can add "more than one" asset
06:30 < modd_:#liferay> if I choose this the buttons for selection are all in wrong positions
06:44 < hufg:#liferay> any ideas why util-java.jar is not copied to deployed plugins?
06:50 < hufg:#liferay> it will be easy to fix with maaven
06:53 < hufg:#liferay> i wonder why the util jars are not domain libs
07:04 < GeoPlace-Tom:#liferay> Morning all, just trying the 6.2 CE bundle (tomcat) and I'm having the most stupid problem, I try to go to myserver:8080 and I just get a 404 :S
07:09 < dblessing:#liferay> GeoPlace-Tom: the logs don't show errors and you see the "Server startup in xxxx ms"?
07:09 < dblessing:#liferay> other things - firewalls, etc blocking you? assuming it's on a remote server?
07:14 < hufg:#liferay> start the domain 8)
07:14 < GeoPlace-Tom:#liferay> dblessing: Firewall is off, (as is SELinux), the one thing I am seeing is errors referring to a wrong password for a liferay user, does it try to create a db somwhere by default?
07:16 < GeoPlace-Tom:#liferay> org.postgresql.util.PSQLException: FATAL: password authentication failed for user "liferay"
07:16 < GeoPlace-Tom:#liferay> But I've not even had a chance to do any db config (the db is there ready for its details to be given to the wizard)
07:19 < dblessing:#liferay> GeoPlace-Tom: after the first startup it should ask you to confirm some configs and change the test@liferay.com user password
07:21 < GeoPlace-Tom:#liferay> dblessing: It's not getting that far, I'm just getting 404 when I got to port 8080
07:22 < dblessing:#liferay> very odd. something has to be failing on startup. is 8080 open on the server?
07:23 < dblessing:#liferay> wait…it says "for user 'liferay'"
07:23 < dblessing:#liferay> Oh! I think it's failing to connect to the postgres DB.
07:23 < GeoPlace-Tom:#liferay> 8080 is up and open
07:23 < GeoPlace-Tom:#liferay> I've copied in the jar for my postgres, do I need to provide a username and password before the wizard?
07:24 < modd_:#liferay> the tomcat bundle would use hsql without configuration
07:24 < dblessing:#liferay> you shouldn't need to, but then again there are many ways in which the wizard can be circumvented
07:24 < GeoPlace-Tom:#liferay> Oh, wait, I did change how postgres connects on local sockets
07:24 < dblessing:#liferay> i also don't think you need a postgres jar do you? it should be included
07:25 < GeoPlace-Tom:#liferay> I'mm remove it and retry
07:25 < GeoPlace-Tom:#liferay> (remove the one I've added)
07:26 < GeoPlace-Tom:#liferay> A-ha, I wonder if that jdbc had some default in it? (I've also turned off auth for local users of the db)
07:27 < GeoPlace-Tom:#liferay> aaaand, 404
07:28 < modd_:#liferay> "But I've not even had a chance to do any db config" - then how did you set up postgres!?
07:29 < GeoPlace-Tom:#liferay> modd_: I mean giving liferay the db details, using psql I've created the database and a user for it, but I've not edited any liferay config files or given any info to liferay wizards
07:31 < GeoPlace-Tom:#liferay> Wait, it's trying to load backup configs I made from a previous try in my home dir
07:32 < hufg:#liferay> ...
07:33 < GeoPlace-Tom:#liferay> Which would be where it's getting the pgsql stuff from
07:34 < dblessing:#liferay> ah ha there it is
07:35 < GeoPlace-Tom:#liferay> I didn't realise ~/ was in the path it checked for portal*.properties
07:37 < GeoPlace-Tom:#liferay> And we have a wizard, thanks for all your help chaps
07:47 < modd_:#liferay> dblessing: do you know anything about a expando field for documents called 'Manualcheckinrequired'
07:47 < dblessing:#liferay> modd_: i don't, sorry
07:48 < modd_:#liferay> do you have such an expando field on your 6.2 installation?
08:39 < modd_:#liferay> sqlexception: user lacks privilege or object not found: TYPESETTINGS ...
08:54 < modd_:#liferay> damn hsql...I hate it sooo much
08:55 < modd_:#liferay> and it's STILL the default db and the settings are STILL hidden behind a big fat "OK" button to go on with the installation
09:12 < hufg:#liferay> achh this is annoying https://issues.liferay.com/browse/LPS-30750
09:14 < modd_:#liferay> this is sparta...I mean liferay
09:14 < hufg:#liferay> hehe yeah
09:14 < hufg:#liferay> though the issue description is fucked up
09:15 < hufg:#liferay> and now we fixed it by restarting the domain, should have debugged it :/
09:17 < hufg:#liferay> it's a tedious thing to reboot the domain on deployments
09:39 < GeoPlace-Tom:#liferay> Ah, progress. Does anyone use Windows AD for their liferay auth?
10:22 < GeoPlace-Tom:#liferay> Oh for, Liferay's LDAP config can't pull the passwords from an AD...
10:25 < dblessing:#liferay> GeoPlace-Tom: can't it pass through though? i think liferay has that option
10:37 < GeoPlace-Tom:#liferay> dblessing: Hello again, it might do, I'm getting an exception when it tries to import users (34) which a google implies there's info missing, but we have screen name, email addresses, first names, and last names (at least for the users I actually want importing)
10:38 < dblessing:#liferay> GeoPlace-Tom: i'm not exactly sure what the property is but i think there's a way to exclude password and to enable the passthrough auth. you may have to do that before syncing
10:43 < GeoPlace-Tom:#liferay> I'm having a look through the docs now to see what I've missed. It's a bit rotten that it offers AD through the gui but you have to faff about in portal-ext to make it do anything but shriek at you
10:46 < dblessing:#liferay> hmm interesting. in my experience the ldap settings via portal properties was the same as in the UI
10:47 < dblessing:#liferay> be aware that anything set in the UI takes precedence over the portal properties. so once you set it in the UI you're forever stuck unless you dig in the DB and remove it
10:47 < GeoPlace-Tom:#liferay> Blech, I think I might have to do that (or roll back, seeing as it's a vm)
10:47 < dblessing:#liferay> yep that'll bite you
10:50 < GeoPlace-Tom:#liferay> I might do the roll-back anyway, we're hoping to write some puppet for this
10:51 < GeoPlace-Tom:#liferay> So having it in portal-ext will be more useful for that
11:01 < hufg:#liferay> http://www.opensourceforlife.com/2012/05/liferay-61-ldap-config-from-portal.html
11:01 < hufg:#liferay> maybe there is something
11:02 < hufg:#liferay> it says not to use ui+properties combination for configuration
11:07 < hufg:#liferay> and some mythical properties :Z
11:07 < GeoPlace-Tom:#liferay> Yeah, I think tomorrow I will rollback and crack open the portal.properties on github, work through it that way
12:43 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Wow. I feel stupid.
12:43 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I can't manage to publish a web content article embedded on a page.
12:43 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I keep publishing the page but the modified web content doesn't show up.
12:43 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> This is so confusing. Oo
13:18 < x91231:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur: is there workflow enabled for the site?
13:19 < x91231:#liferay> Sometimes someone needs to approve the thing; it gets tricky to find out who has it. With 6.06 I queried the DB.
