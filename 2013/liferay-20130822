10:16 < cythrawll> we're having hella cache problems.
10:16 < cythrawll> the blocking cache is on by default... everything performs pretty well with it. but our servers hang and deadlock threads often
10:17 < cythrawll> so we turned it off, now the site is slow as hell
10:17 < cythrawll> all the bugs pertaining to this say fixed for 6.1... but obviously that's not the case
10:17 < cythrawll> and there's no clear patch listed in the bugs
10:18 < cythrawll> https://issues.liferay.com/browse/LPS-15754
10:21 <@rotty3000> cythrawll: are you on 6.1EE ?
10:22 < cythrawll> no
10:22 < cythrawll> CE
10:23 <@rotty3000> so sadly, when the tickets say "fixed for 6.1" it typically means somewhere along the EE track
10:23 <@rotty3000> and I can see from the resolutions that this is indeed the case here
10:23 <@rotty3000> the code is in 6.2 or master however
10:24 <@rotty3000> so it will be in the next CE release
10:24 < cythrawll> it does say CE in the ticket
10:25 < cythrawll> :|
10:25 <@rotty3000> it's says                Fix Version/s:--Sprint - SP,Â 6.1.0 CE RC1
10:25 <@rotty3000> that doesn't mean it made the CE release
10:26 <@rotty3000> I know that's confusing.
10:27 <@rotty3000> but I see 5 associated tickets to which the resolutions are actually attached
10:27 < cythrawll> :<
10:27 <@rotty3000> and those resolutions are actually provided as hotfixes for the EE release
10:27 <@rotty3000> and so those would be in the EE fixpacks and GA releases
10:27 < cythrawll> meh
10:27 <@rotty3000> and also in the next CE to come
10:28 <@rotty3000> :(
10:28 <@rotty3000> I could give you the ticket numbers and that would let you trace the commits in the master repo
10:28 <@rotty3000> from which you could build a patch
10:29 < cythrawll> yeah we might have to do that... i dunno
10:29 < cythrawll> we're still seeing if we can fix our issue
10:30 < cythrawll> because our stuff is now unusably slow
10:30 < cythrawll> it's like it's not cacheing at all anymore
10:31 < cythrawll> kind of surprised liferay would only put the patch in EE when it's a show stopping bug for CE
10:33 < cythrawll> rotty3000, maybe I can get my developer on here, and maybe we can get help with that patch?
10:34 <@rotty3000> I can offer a little support, but I can't guarantee anything
10:35 <@rotty3000> we can try
10:35 < cythrawll> rochad meet rotty
10:35 < cythrawll> rotty, rochad
10:36 < rochadt> hey
10:36 <@rotty3000> btw, I think this is the patch https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/commit/9845e72f5747ef19f9a52ea06b8a87aab5c4c682
10:36 <@rotty3000> hey
10:37 <@rotty3000> it's possible to search the commit comments easily if you checkout/fork the repo locally
10:37 <@rotty3000> it's quite easy with most git clients
10:37 < rochadt> good to know!
10:37 < rochadt> so LPS-15754 never made it into 6.1 ga1?
10:38 <@rotty3000> checking
10:39 <@rotty3000> strange, in fact it says "Precedes: 6.1.0-b1"
10:39 <@rotty3000> which means it's container in that tag.. which one would thing would have preceeded the GAs
10:39 < rochadt> that's why I was wondering
10:40 <@rotty3000> in fact it does... so perhaps you're seeing a different issue altogether
10:40 < rochadt> I have the 6.1 ga1 source, I'm just going to verify these changes to be sure
10:40 -!- mode/#liferay [+o jhf] by ChanServ
10:41 < cythrawll> basically we're seeing this same thing: https://issues.liferay.com/browse/LPS-19861
10:41 <@rotty3000> rochadt, cythrawll: btw, is there a ticket which exactly describes your issue?
10:42 < cythrawll> yeah the one I just posted
10:42 <@rotty3000> right, hmm.. the resolution is the same as the other ticket in the commit I posted
10:42 < cythrawll> except response times don't creep up
10:42 < cythrawll> it just completely deadlocks the threads
10:42 < cythrawll> and requests don't complete at all
10:43 < cythrawll> they just spin forever
10:43 < cythrawll> actually that's happening in a TP-Processor497 ... ours are happening in the tomcat executor threads
10:44 <@rotty3000> can you show me how you disabled it?
10:44 < cythrawll> rochadt, can
10:46 < rochadt> ok sorry about that...
10:46 < rochadt> yes that patch is definitely in 6.1
10:46 < rochadt> and we disabled the blocking cache with a portal property, hcache.blocking.cache.allowed=false
10:47 < rochadt> ehcache**
10:48 < dave_k> hello all
10:48 <@rotty3000> try permissions.object.blocking.cache=false instead
10:50 < rochadt> ok rotty, thank you I will try that now
10:50 <@rotty3000> rochadt: cythrawll also under the heading "## Value Object" in portal properties, there is a whole slew of caching flags
10:51 <@rotty3000> rochadt: cythrawll including per entity cache settings
10:51 <@rotty3000> cache type, etc..
10:54 < rochadt> Ah I've never noticed these settings before
10:54 < rochadt> I also noticed that when we did the jstack thread dumps
10:54 < rochadt> we had a lot of replication threads...
10:56 < dave_k> we're having a strange request ... using one liferay instance, we want to deliver multiple sites/organizations, but keep the users of the different sites completely disconnected, i.e. one user (one email address) has to sign up for each of these sites. But he should not be able to see that he is actually on the same liferay instance. Is that possible in any way?
10:56 < cythrawll> rochadt, I think that's the side effect of the default ehcache distribution
10:56 < cythrawll> have to get the EE version for the light thread replication I guess
10:57 <@rotty3000> dave_k: that's called portal instances, Liferay supports that OOTB
10:57 < dave_k> rotty3000: Thanks. Why didn't I see that? *selfslap*
10:58 <@rotty3000> dave_k: it's like a virtual hosting built into liferay, each "instance" is isolated from each other
10:58 <@rotty3000> :)
10:58 < dave_k> ... and clustering would work on top of that?
10:59 <@rotty3000> dave_k: I have one suggestion however.. if you plan to scale really really large.. I would suggest, actual separate Liferay deployments
10:59 <@rotty3000> dave_k: yes
10:59 < dave_k> i.e. the clustering config is orthogonal to the Portal instance config?
10:59 <@rotty3000> all Liferay features work in that mode
10:59 <@rotty3000> exactly
11:00 < dave_k> wheeeeee!
11:00 <@rotty3000> again, the limit then becomes a problem of "Data structures"
11:00 <@rotty3000> no matter how good code is,, it has limits for concurrency
11:00 < dave_k> and how about plugin deployment?
11:01 <@rotty3000> so if you plan to have each "instance" with 1 million users, and 500 instances
11:01 <@rotty3000> then please use separate nodes :)
11:01 < dave_k> (we actually plan multiple liferay instances on multiple tomcats on multiple hardware)
11:01 <@rotty3000> great
11:01 <@rotty3000> sure
11:02 < dave_k> plugins would need to be deployed to each tomcat instance separately, I gather?
11:02 <@rotty3000> exactly
11:04 <@rotty3000> cythrawll: re threading... good question, not even sure myself
11:04 < dave_k> okay. what about different plugin versions for liferay instances on the same tomcat? (i.e. a hook that behaves differently for instance A and B) ... I think that that must be a configuration option in the plugin, yes?
11:05 <@rotty3000> dave_k: correct! although it's planned to support actual plugin versions in future versions of Lifeay (to a degree)
11:06 < dave_k> okay, I think we have a winner! :)
11:06 <@rotty3000> good luck dave_k!
11:07 < dave_k> we already had luck with a small-scale liferay installation over a two-server cluster serving one site. no onto something bigger :)
11:07 < dave_k> *now
11:08 < dave_k> thanks, rotty3000. very helpful answers!
11:08 <@rotty3000> cythrawll: rochadt, you may be interested in simply trying the 6.1.x branch of liferay
11:09 <@rotty3000> dave_k: n/p
11:09 <@rotty3000> https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/tree/6.1.x
11:10 < rochadt> we may look into moving to GA3
11:11 < rochadt> 6.2 will be released fairly soon though, no?
11:12 <@rotty3000> rochadt: man I hope so!
11:12 < rochadt> right!
11:12 < rochadt> :D
11:12 <@jhf> rochadt: I am hoping for GA3 to be out in the next 7 days. testing is complete, we are just updating the marketplace portlets so that they claim compatibility with GA3.
11:13 <@jhf> but don't rely on that "hope" :)
11:13 < rochadt> well thank you for the heads up
11:13 <@jhf> 6.2 is targeted at "this autumn"
11:13 <@jhf> but you also must not rely on that :)
11:23 < rochadt> rotty3000: thank you again for helping with this issue, we're going to have to keep an eye on it for a while.
11:35 < dave_k> hmmm ... Just seeing GA3 ... Does that have the UI updates as of 6.2-B2?
11:35 <@jhf> nope
11:35 <@jhf> GA3 does not have the bootstrap-ificaiton that occurred in 6.2
11:35 < dave_k> ok, understandable :)
11:35 <@jhf> yeah.. being a "patch" release and all :)
11:51 < cythrawll> there seems to be something holding requests to portal resources (static files are fine) for almost exactly 5 seconds
11:51 < cythrawll> does that sound like anything? maybe a timeout somewhere?
11:51 < cythrawll> we're getting 5 second load tiems or more very consistently
11:57 < cythrawll> bootstrapification for liferay?
11:57 < cythrawll> does that mean it'll be mobile friendly by default?
11:57 < cythrawll> :p
11:58 < cythrawll> our UX team will be happy to hear that.
11:58 < cythrawll> they been pestering us with responsive design for a bit now :p
12:08 < rochadt> yea it seems like something is still locking the cache entity
12:08 < rochadt> If I hit a css file being returned from the theme for example
12:09 < rochadt> most of the time it will load ~8ms
12:09 < rochadt> then on some for no apparent reason it takes 5.01 seconds...
12:26 < jardineworks> any liferay people around
12:26 < jardineworks> I need a moment of help... I have no idea what is wrong with the build scripts
12:26 < jardineworks> I have a class MyAuthenticator extends Authenticator.
12:27 < jardineworks> I have implmented the methods with @Override
12:27 < jardineworks> but the ant compile task keeps telling me that i need to override the superclass methods?!
12:29 < rochadt> I think you are compiling with the 1.5 jdk
12:30 < rochadt> in your build.properties in the liferay sdk
12:31 < rochadt> what are you ant.build.javac target and source?
12:31 < jardineworks> rochadt, nope -- actually, and this is crazy, I have a lib reference (from another project in the same workspace) that was wrong. Why on earth that results in THAT error, I have no idea.
12:31 < rochadt> strange
12:34 < jardineworks> very
12:50 < cythrawll> jardineworks, does each method match the signature of each method you overwritten?
13:18 < jardineworks> cythrawll, 100%.. I used eclipse to generate them
14:21 < jardineworks> anyone awake in here written they own custom authenticator before?
14:23 < jardineworks> I have written my class and inserted it into the authentication pipeline.
14:24 < jardineworks> The validation (externally) works, and I return Authenticator.SUCCESS ... but the portal seems stuck. It just keeps "loading" and doesn't render a pagfe for me
14:48 < jardineworks> hmmmm I just stepped through the AutPipeline code and at every turn Authenticator.SUCCESS is returned.
14:59 <@jhf> jardineworks: can you 'jstack' it to see what the stuck thread is?
15:01 < jardineworks> it just worked.
15:01 < jardineworks> I have no idea what made it start working lol
