02:14 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> how can i add the aui:input element on runtime using javascript?
04:36 < hufg:#liferay> :Z
04:46 < hufg:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur: the caching problem in that kind of a setup can be related to configs and infrastructure also
04:46 < hufg:#liferay> the cluster can seemingly work in liferay logs but cache replicating still doesn't work with certain infrastructure problems
05:13 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> hufg: It's pretty obvious that we do have caching problems.
05:14 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> The question is: How to solve them? Would it be enough to properly set up the clustering?
06:44 < hufg:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur: a properly set up cluster does not have caching issues
06:44 < hufg:#liferay> 8)
06:45 < hufg:#liferay> i was trying to tell you there may be issues in the infrastructure if you have caching problems in a cluster
06:46 < hufg:#liferay> i think liferay doesn't have much to do with caching in a cluster
06:46 < hufg:#liferay> there is just the ehcache setup, cluster configuration and the underlying infrastructyure
06:51 < hufg:#liferay> like i said it is possible to have the cluster "link" working without having a working cache replication ie. liferay finds cluster nodes in the server log and nothing is wrong in server log but still ehcache is not replicated
06:51 < hufg:#liferay> this we have encountered with improper infrastructure setup
06:53 < hufg:#liferay> mismatching ehcache/portal-ext.properties would  also do this
06:53 < hufg:#liferay> mismatching/wrong
06:57 < hufg:#liferay> do you even have a clustered setup or just a shared database? :D
07:33 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> hufg: That's what I meant. We only have shared DB and shared DL.
07:34 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> So I guess every node has its own cache and when something changes onle the node doing the change refreshes its cache.
08:07 < hufg:#liferay> yes 8)
08:08 < hufg:#liferay> yees yees so you pick up the admin guide and setup the cache and test like a motherfucker and then go into production np np
08:08 < hufg:#liferay> :D
08:08 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> *lol* I found a scheduer job in the project...every minute it checks if the cache should be cleared. By some totally idiotic mechanic...
08:10 < hufg:#liferay> mm
08:13 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Apparently there is a PublishingListener somewhere that writes an entry into the database saying "server xy just published something!!".
08:13 < hufg:#liferay> what version do you have?
08:14 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> 6.1.0
08:14 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> And it's heavily modified.
08:14 < hufg:#liferay> i wouldn't be too confident to have a clustered liferay with older versions
08:14 < hufg:#liferay> ehm clustered environment
08:14 < hufg:#liferay> maybe 6.1.0 is ok
08:14 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Which is probably why they implemented this shit.
08:14 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Doesn't make it any better though.
08:14 < hufg:#liferay> it may also be an infrastructure issue
08:18 < hufg:#liferay> you need routers with multicast support and there may be all kinds of network setups that don't go well with that
08:18 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> It's all Amazon EC2.
08:18 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> So multicast is out of the question.
08:19 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> And there isn't any clustering setup. As far as the official Liferay documentation goes, they did the first two steps...same DB and same S3 bucket for the DL. And nothing else. There they just stopped setting it up properly.
08:19 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> And then comes the nasty stuff...custom modifications to the core to somehow track publishing and do weird cache clearing and whatnot. -.-
08:21 < hufg:#liferay> if you can't have multicast then liferay clustering is out of question
08:22 < hufg:#liferay> get a good loadbalancer, disable cache all is good!
08:24 < hufg:#liferay> and buy a new server hehe
08:25 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Apparently it's possible to set up Liferay clusting with unicast as well.
08:25 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> At least there are a lot of articles and forum entries about that.
08:25 < hufg:#liferay> mmh ok no clue about that
08:26 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Another solution might be to get a proxy cluster and have only one Liferay instance.
08:26 < hufg:#liferay> you will never upgrade with those customizations :D
08:26 < hufg:#liferay> on the same environment
08:27 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Yeah. That's my main argument at the moment for why we should start over.
08:27 < hufg:#liferay> mm
08:28 < hufg:#liferay> you may still need an army of consultantas anyhow
08:28 < hufg:#liferay> consultants
08:28 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Well...there is me...and two outsourced developers... -.-
08:28 < hufg:#liferay> maybe liferay sharpens up the upgrade process in the future
08:28 < hufg:#liferay> 6.1.x and further may be all right i suppose
08:29 < hufg:#liferay> may 8)
08:31 < hufg:#liferay> anyways that unicast clustering seems interesting didn't know it is possible
08:33 < hufg:#liferay> http://www.liferay.com/community/forums/-/message_boards/message/7804513?_19_preview=false#_19_message_7804513
08:34 < hufg:#liferay> seems to be good stuff
08:34 < jardineworks:#liferay> morning
08:38 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, still fighting with the cache?
08:39 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Hi jardineworks.
08:39 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Yeah.
08:39 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> And with our lack of a proper clustering setup.
08:39 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> (I hate having to deal with so many things at once. I never manage to finish something properly before the next issue pops up. -.-)
08:40 < hufg:#liferay> hehe yeah
08:40 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, One thing you can consider to help with the debugging.. to at least see what is happening with ehcache is to turn up the logging on ehcache specifically.
08:40 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I would consider that as soon as I get access to the logfiles. -.-
08:40 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, out of curiosity.. and so I know what to avoid... what was the name of the company that made you fucked up application? :)
08:41 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> That company is out of business now.
08:41 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, you don't have access to the servers to set the cluster up. You don't have access to the files to debug. Dude, you have an impossible job.
08:41 < jardineworks:#liferay> what WERE they called.
08:41 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Which makes it even more problematic, because we can't ask anybody.
08:41 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I won't point fingers. ;)
08:41 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> And my boss probably would kill me for mentioning something like that in a public chat. ;)
08:41 < jardineworks:#liferay> c'mon -- the rest of us can use this to find their clients and sell more work!
08:42 < hufg:#liferay> :d
08:42 < jardineworks:#liferay> we KNOW their LR projects are all messed up at least :)
08:42 < hufg:#liferay> jardineworks: it's no use! i don't contract :((
08:42 < hufg:#liferay> maybe i can start then
08:44 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> jardineworks: I requested access to the production system for debugging purposes. That request is apparently still running through boards and whatnot.
08:44 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> At some point I will probably get it...
08:44 < dave_k:#liferay> hello all ... i'm wondering if it would be possible to restrict the "server" part of the control panel to the local subnet?
08:44 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> There is till a tiny spark of hope that I will find a clear hint in there about what's going wrong.
08:45 < jardineworks:#liferay> hufg, at least you would have a good lead to start :)
08:45 < jardineworks:#liferay> dave_k, can you do that with url filters at the load balancer?
08:46 < dave_k:#liferay> jardineworks: I assume yes
08:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, without the tools? I would imagine that you are in for a frustrating journey.
08:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, What is your workstation/laptop like?
08:46 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> jardineworks: Bitemarks all over it.
08:46 < hufg:#liferay> you should first setup a similiar env for further studying
08:47 < dave_k:#liferay> but since all control panel stuff shares the same base url, I think, thats not that easy
08:47 < hufg:#liferay> i think any debugging access for prod would be denied here
08:47 < jardineworks:#liferay> maybe you could do what I do... I use Virtual Box and spin up several VMs to replicate production environments. If you were able to reproduce the same configuration on your local you could at least get an understanding of what happens with a non-cluster 5 vm environmnet with a single db
08:47 < hufg:#liferay> and it's reasonable imho
08:47 < hufg:#liferay> yes just dump the databases and build your env on virtual machines
08:48 < hufg:#liferay> but then ofc you will spend next 2 months replicating the setup because of lack of documentation etc(?)
08:48 < hufg:#liferay> see the questionmark, you have some hope hehe
08:48 < jardineworks:#liferay> dave_k, I'm not  load balancing guru... but the url does have portlet id 137 in it. Would that help? I think p137 is the server administration portlet.
08:49 < hufg:#liferay> though cloning servers is valid too but doesn't give much of insight in itself
08:49 < dave_k:#liferay> jardineworks: would look like a bad hack, since the links would still show up
08:50 < jardineworks:#liferay> Oh I see
08:50 < dave_k:#liferay> jardineworks: and yes, 137 is the server admin portlet
08:50 < jardineworks:#liferay> you want to hide it
08:50 < jardineworks:#liferay> hmmm
08:50 < jardineworks:#liferay> why based on IP instead of a group/role?
08:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> I mean, if you know what IP people are at :)
08:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> ... can't you put them in a group?
08:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> or is it anyone on a subnet?
08:51 < dave_k:#liferay> not only hide, but e.g. the JS function _137_saveServer('gc') should have no effect from the outside, even if maliciously constructed with the correct server session
08:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> OU I know.
08:52 < jardineworks:#liferay> JSP Hook and add the code to find their IP as a conditional c:if :)
08:52 < jardineworks:#liferay> .. and wrap the whole page in the condition
08:53 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> jardineworks: I already have a local setup of this awful abomination. Not clustered, of course, but otherwise very similar.
08:54 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, so can you turn up the logging on ehcache locally and try to reproduce the problem?
08:55 < dave_k:#liferay> jardineworks: ummm ... okay, I think I have to check what _137_saveServer('gc') actually does ... I'm assuming a POST on some URL ...
08:55 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I doubt it, because I don't have a clustered setup locally.
08:55 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I would have to setup a second box on the same db to simulate the issues.
08:55 < dave_k:#liferay> jardineworks: ... with a Java class handler behind that, not done in JSP ...
08:57 < dave_k:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur: I just did exactly that. Duplicated the VM, edited: /etc/hostname, /etc/hosts, Liferay JDBC and cluster config.
08:57 < jardineworks:#liferay> dave_k, sure, I just meant that the JSP hook can be used to hide the entire section. I'm added my own sections before ... you can hook ROOT/html/portlet/control_panel_menu/view.jsp to blank it out based on what your Java class tells you
08:57 < jardineworks:#liferay> clone is your friend.
08:58 < dave_k:#liferay> jardineworks: ah, ok, got it ... you mean: blanking out requests on the loadbalancer to anything containing p_p_id=137 and adding a hook to hide it in the UI?
09:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> dave_k, bingo.
09:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> does anyone know whether or not it is possible to get all articles with a particular structure id?
09:08 < dave_k:#liferay> umm ... re-reading all your comment, jardineworks ... would it be possible to restrict the server admin superuser logins to a certain IP range?
09:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> dave_k, with a login hook I would imagine you could. You just set your own auth.pipeline.pre Action class
09:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> do the checks and if it works, pass it on to the regular login process
09:11 < dave_k:#liferay> jardineworks: the point of the network admin of the server hoster is: "no-one, and I mean no-one should be able to e.g. clear the database cache from outside our local network!"
09:12 < dave_k:#liferay> in other words: he would be grateful if that would not even be possible via the web interface
09:13 < jardineworks:#liferay> dave_k, why not just use a sticky session to route all admin traffic to ONE server, and restrict that servers access to the local network?
09:13 < jardineworks:#liferay> I'm no network guy.. but I assume that could be done no?
09:13 < dave_k:#liferay> okay, preAction stuff would be a method ... been there, done that
09:14 < dave_k:#liferay> hum? sticky sessions? dunno about that
09:15 < dave_k:#liferay> jardineworks: but reading your hint, I would assume that this would mean another tomcat instance? no can do.
09:15 < jardineworks:#liferay> dave_k, how many do you have?
09:15 < dave_k:#liferay> two
09:15 < jardineworks:#liferay> ah
09:15 < jardineworks:#liferay> ok
09:15 < jardineworks:#liferay> nevermind
09:15 < jardineworks:#liferay> lol
09:15 < jardineworks:#liferay> you can't really pull one out of that pool :)
09:15 < dave_k:#liferay> correct
09:16 < jardineworks:#liferay> and you are saying no to the login hook/
09:16 < jardineworks:#liferay> ?
09:16 < dave_k:#liferay> nope, that would an option. only one minor point: needs to be developed, is not OOTB
09:17 < jardineworks:#liferay> dave_k, correct. If you have the code that does the IP detection stuff tough, it would be a 30 minute job to write that hook.
09:17 < jardineworks:#liferay> however, someone who is ip spoofing might be able to bypass it right?
09:17 < dave_k:#liferay> OOTB is always easier to sell to the project manager. We're still evaluating whether to use Liferay or something else in the current project
09:18 < jardineworks:#liferay> but if IP is how you are going to prevent the actions, spoofing will be a concern no matter what the approach.
09:19 < jardineworks:#liferay> dave_k, well, truth be told, LR is not really made for this sort of thing. What you are talking about is application access right (outside of user accounts I mean)? normally those things are controlled outside as a barrier to the application server itself.
09:19 < dave_k:#liferay> jardineworks: If the firewall/DMZ admin does his job, he would not let any packet with a local network address enter his network from the outside.
09:19 < jardineworks:#liferay> dave_k, fair enough
09:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> dave_k, why is an additional tomcat instance not an option? I mean you wouldn't need anyting more than a cheap desktop to manage the control panel load.
09:22 < dave_k:#liferay> well, the project manager was a bit taken aback when he saw the server tab in the control panel and said that the network admin would like to have this stuff (run GC, clear caches, clear indices...) only permissible and possible from the command line
09:23 < hufg:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur: we have now been trying to upgrade 6.1.1 GA2 ce to 6.1.2 GA3 ce for a week and it looks like a no go
09:23 < hufg:#liferay> it's ridiculous
09:24 < hufg:#liferay> this is what i mean by an army of consultants for liferay upgrade
09:24 < dave_k:#liferay> jardineworks: because I ain't the network admin of the big data center where two tomcats are to be reserved for a tiny liferay instance (compared to all the other stuff that runs there). security is tight in that network.
09:24 < jardineworks:#liferay> dave_k, you might want to see if you can get a hold of rotty3000. I think he works on the security team so he might be able to give you some good guidance that is outside my wheelhouse. All I know are tricks you can try with hooks and such -- but if you want sometrhing that is OOTB he would know better than me (I'm still learning a lot of stuff)
09:25 < dave_k:#liferay> well, maybe he reads this later and catches me on twitter :)
09:25 <@rotty3000:#liferay> what's up guys?
09:25 < dave_k:#liferay> *lol*
09:25 < dave_k:#liferay> hey rotty3000
09:25 < hufg:#liferay> rotty3000: why don't you test your upgrades!
09:25 < hufg:#liferay> 8)
09:25 <@rotty3000:#liferay> uhmm, we test our upgrades..
09:25 < hufg:#liferay> or is ce supposed to be unupgradeable
09:26 <@rotty3000:#liferay> upgrades are complex our deployment matrix is vast..
09:26 < hufg:#liferay> yeah
09:26 <@rotty3000:#liferay> so it's quite easy to miss things, it's impossible to test all possible scenarios :(
09:27 <@rotty3000:#liferay> factor: DB + app server + portal.properties options
09:27 <@rotty3000:#liferay> and the number of variations is somewhere in the billions
09:27 < hufg:#liferay> true true
09:27 < hufg:#liferay> but it's frustrating nevertheless
09:27 <@rotty3000:#liferay> absolutely
09:29 < hufg:#liferay> there is some trouble with dl library and permissions with ce ga2 -> ga3 upgrade considering staging and publishing
09:29 < hufg:#liferay> and no publishing is instant show stopper
09:30 <@rotty3000:#liferay> so what's going on with permissions?
09:30 < dave_k:#liferay> rotty3000: if you've got time after hufg ... have you got an idea on how to restrict the control panels "server" options and methods (both in UI and maliciously constructed requests) to the local network/a specific IP range OOTB? the network admin does not like that it's possible to e.g. delete the DB cache via web requests...
09:31 < hufg:#liferay> ahh i can't use paste bin
09:31 <@rotty3000:#liferay> dave_k: hmm.. if topolik was here, he would be the guy to ask, he's done work in that area
09:31 < hufg:#liferay> ortlet_jsp:157] com.liferay.portal.kernel.lar.PortletDataException: com.liferay.portal.security.auth.PrincipalException
09:31 <@rotty3000:#liferay> hufg: private gist (gist.github.com)?
09:32 < dave_k:#liferay> ah, okay, thx, I hope to catch him before my vacation (which starts in a few hours ;)
09:32 <@rotty3000:#liferay> dave_k: you may be able to use the urlfilter
09:33 <@rotty3000:#liferay> dave_k: urlrewrite filter portal-web/docroot/WEB-INF/urlrewrite.xml
09:33 <@rotty3000:#liferay> it has the capability to force requirements on urls, or redirect to somewhere else
09:34 < hufg:#liferay> rotty3000: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/a1037af2a54c183fc65c
09:34 < dave_k:#liferay> rotty3000: I was considering a similar option with jardineworks earlier. Might still seem like a hack to the network admin and still needs additional work for a plugin that hides it in the UI
09:35 <@rotty3000:#liferay> dave_k: I'm trying to recall if the new AccessControl stuff is in 6.1 or 6.2 that has some url/host/domain restriction capabilities
09:35 <@rotty3000:#liferay> dave_k: yeah, still might
09:35 < hufg:#liferay> rotty3000: and https://gist.github.com/anonymous/4fa3436fa2a4e868b374
09:35 < dave_k:#liferay> we're still evaluating and real project start would not be before last week of october
09:36 <@rotty3000:#liferay> hufg: can you put the whole trace?
09:36 <@rotty3000:#liferay> seems like the best part is missing (bottom)
09:36 < dave_k:#liferay> ... so 6.2 might be a viable option.
09:36 < hufg:#liferay> ahh gist refused the whole stack trace, ill try again
09:37 <@rotty3000:#liferay> hufg: that's strange, must be anon limitation
09:37 < hufg:#liferay> but anyways thats during publish from live to staging
09:37 < hufg:#liferay> and local staging
09:38 < hufg:#liferay> even if i uncheck the document library portlet
09:39 <@rotty3000:#liferay> does the person publishing have all the correct permissions to add the assets on the import side?
09:39 < hufg:#liferay> it's the portal admin user
09:39 <@rotty3000:#liferay> right
09:39 <@rotty3000:#liferay> local staging?
09:40 < hufg:#liferay> yes no remote publish
09:41 < hufg:#liferay> anyways our upgrade process was like this -> publish with GA2 running -> install GA3 -> make changes to articles and dl -> publish (this was ok) -> setup live virtualhost and staging virtualhost -> make changes to articles -> publish (fail) -> revert virtualhosts and article change -> publish (fail)
09:41 <@rotty3000:#liferay> need the next part of the stack trace to understand the call path completely
09:42 < hufg:#liferay> rotty3000: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/3a5bd10a28004f6d3bdd thats the situation now
09:42 < hufg:#liferay> enough? :/
09:43 < hufg:#liferay> and actually you need to upgrade dlfolder lastpostdate for this upgrade before publishing
09:43 < hufg:#liferay> forgot to mention it
09:44 < hufg:#liferay> rotty3000: why is there a huge GA3 commit on git?
09:44 <@rotty3000:#liferay> :'( don't ask..
09:44 < hufg:#liferay> some of the changes just point to the GA3 commit, impossible to track the real commit =(
09:45 <@rotty3000:#liferay> I know.. I'm not sure what to say about that
09:45 <@rotty3000:#liferay> hufg: about the stack trace
09:45 <@rotty3000:#liferay> there is something interesting
09:46 <@rotty3000:#liferay> consider the line https://gist.github.com/anonymous/3a5bd10a28004f6d3bdd#file-gistfile1-txt-L45
09:46 < hufg:#liferay> i can't tell you why the dlfolder migration needs to be done and now i lost the issue, but dlfolder lastpostdate has a new default value which is the creation date and on publish it can't be null, in GA2 the default value is null
09:46 <@rotty3000:#liferay> which leads to this line https://gist.github.com/anonymous/3a5bd10a28004f6d3bdd#file-gistfile1-txt-L24
09:47 < hufg:#liferay> mm and?
09:47 <@rotty3000:#liferay> that logic is clearly flawed.. a local service should never lead to a non local service call
09:47 <@rotty3000:#liferay> non-local = authenticated                local = not authenticated
09:48 <@rotty3000:#liferay> however, I would still expect it to at least work in this case because it was invoked by a logged in admin
09:48 <@rotty3000:#liferay> which means the authentication context should have setup already
09:50 < hufg:#liferay> mm
09:50 <@rotty3000:#liferay> .. I have to dig into who made this change
09:50 < hufg:#liferay> hehe
09:50 <@rotty3000:#liferay> you have sources?
09:50 < hufg:#liferay> yes
09:51 <@rotty3000:#liferay> uhmm, never mind
09:51 <@rotty3000:#liferay> I was going to suggest the change the the local service, but the method sig is different, and i wouldn't trust just flipping around to find one that matches
09:52 <@rotty3000:#liferay> hufg: .. btw, it's like this even in master :facepalm:
09:53 < hufg:#liferay> mm
09:53 < hufg:#liferay> rotty3000: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/19dd16c96ae76df86b83 this is the previous permission error
09:53 < hufg:#liferay> not the same method
09:54 <@rotty3000:#liferay> same cause
09:54 <@rotty3000:#liferay> a local method calling a non-local method
09:54 < hufg:#liferay> similiar exception though
09:54 <@rotty3000:#liferay> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/19dd16c96ae76df86b83#file-gistfile1-txt-L45 leading to https://gist.github.com/anonymous/19dd16c96ae76df86b83#file-gistfile1-txt-L24
09:54 < hufg:#liferay> oh you think it's because of that?
09:55 < hufg:#liferay> even with admin user
09:55 < hufg:#liferay> and to further make things more complex it worked once...
09:55 <@rotty3000:#liferay> it depends on the context.. if this is running in a background process.. and the security context isn't setup because the developer expected "hey, it's local... I don't need security.."
09:55 <@rotty3000:#liferay> then it would fail
09:56 < hufg:#liferay> ok
09:56 < hufg:#liferay> so what can be done excluding modifications to liferay source? :D
09:56 <@rotty3000:#liferay> so having the entire stack trace would really help
09:57 < hufg:#liferay> well lets see
09:57 <@rotty3000:#liferay> since I can't tell what the call context here
10:01 < hufg:#liferay> rotty3000: ok now gist worked current: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/281bf6b594affd4f69a2 previous: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/10f6b64b93426b4b1fbb
10:02 < hufg:#liferay> mm the previous one is incomplete didn't save it fully
10:02 < hufg:#liferay> but current is the whole stack trace
10:04 <@rotty3000:#liferay> I really hate glassfish logging.. the stack traces are truncated no matter what I think...
10:05 < hufg:#liferay> :Z
10:05 <@rotty3000:#liferay> however.. it looks like the security context should be setup
10:06 <@rotty3000:#liferay> because the stack does seem to directly result from the action request made by the admin
10:06 < hufg:#liferay> ok
10:06 <@rotty3000:#liferay> vs. being a child thread or background callable
10:07 <@rotty3000:#liferay> so yeah.. not sure why the permission error
10:08 <@rotty3000:#liferay> and you're 100% certain this is the omni admin?
10:08 < hufg:#liferay> yes
10:08 < hufg:#liferay> it's the one created with setup wizard
10:09 <@rotty3000:#liferay> k, so the only thing I can suggest is debugging past https://gist.github.com/anonymous/281bf6b594affd4f69a2#file-gistfile1-txt-L24
10:10 <@rotty3000:#liferay> because the admin role is supposed to have it's logic short circuited to never reach the DB
10:10 <@rotty3000:#liferay> so it should have nothing to do with DB data
10:10 <@rotty3000:#liferay> it has to me a logic error
10:10 < hufg:#liferay> hehe yeah we have been doing that
10:10 < hufg:#liferay> but it will take some time
10:11 <@rotty3000:#liferay> if you could only identify where it's actually returning the false return from the permission check, we could probably find if from there
10:12 < hufg:#liferay> yeah
10:18 <@rotty3000:#liferay> I sent an email to the guy that made those changes
10:18 <@rotty3000:#liferay> btw, have you filled a ticket?
10:18 <@rotty3000:#liferay> if so, link me? if not, create one and link me? I'll make Alex aware and give it a high priority
10:18 < hufg:#liferay> no :/
10:19 < hufg:#liferay> ok
10:19 <@rotty3000:#liferay> there is clearly a design flaw either way
10:20 <@rotty3000:#liferay> if the change was made to call a local service, there _would_ be no permission check... hence nothing to fail on
10:23 < hufg:#liferay> mm
10:23 < hufg:#liferay> we will debug it and create a ticket
10:24 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> rotty3000: A quick question if I may...Is there some official position concerning Liferay clusters in Amazon EC2? There is sooo much different information out there that I don't know what to believe.
10:25 <@rotty3000:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur: ha, I'm not entirely sure myself, but I can ask
10:25 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Apparently the default way to setup a cluster doesn't work because Multicast is not supported by EC2.
10:26 <@rotty3000:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur: I will ask our lead GS consultant who I know for a fact has built large clusters on EC2
10:26 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> The question is: Is there a reliable way to do it anyway or are these just "lucky" hacks.
10:26 <@rotty3000:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur: I was going to say that
10:26 <@rotty3000:#liferay> you need unicast
10:26 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Yeah. But all information I could find concerning that seems...dunno. Scattered, incomplete, dubious.
10:27 <@rotty3000:#liferay> right, so if you can wait a little while for me to get some feedback, I can relay it to you
10:27 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Definitely. I would really appreciate it.
10:27 <@rotty3000:#liferay> n/p
10:29 < hufg:#liferay> rotty3000: tell us whats up with the GA3 commit! 8)
10:29 <@rotty3000:#liferay> hufg: I honestly don't know what to make of it myself, so I will refrain from commenting if you don't mind
10:30 < hufg:#liferay> hehe ok
10:32 < hufg:#liferay> rotty3000: how long have you worked with liferay?
10:32 <@rotty3000:#liferay> since 2005
10:33 < hufg:#liferay> my only real complaint with liferay is the quality :/
10:33 <@rotty3000:#liferay> I can't argue with that :(
10:34 <@rotty3000:#liferay> it's been a long term mission of mine to improve it, and so I have pretty much moved away from "feature" development
10:34 < hufg:#liferay> some rough edges around the corners is acceptable but some of the core functionality in liferay have it too
10:34 <@rotty3000:#liferay> totally agree
10:34 < hufg:#liferay> yeah we have been discussing it here, you should just feature freeze and grind those bugs down
10:35 < hufg:#liferay> 8)
10:35 <@rotty3000:#liferay> the core is so vitally important, it's really the future of our whole platform to drastically improve in that regard
10:35 < hufg:#liferay> yes
10:35 <@rotty3000:#liferay> and so that's my current primary goal
10:35 < hufg:#liferay> ce GA3 seems to be a step into that direction at least looking at the jira issues
10:36 < hufg:#liferay> mainly defects etc
10:36 < hufg:#liferay> i'd like to see more of those kind of releases!
10:42 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Oh wow. I just realized that the DevCon will be here this year.
10:42 <@rotty3000:#liferay> you mean Berlin ?
10:42 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Like 20 minutes from where I'm staying right now.
10:42 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Yes!
10:42 <@rotty3000:#liferay> awesome, I will be there
10:43 < hufg:#liferay> berlin is gr8
10:43 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I guess I should ask if my employer might consider sending me there.
10:43 <@rotty3000:#liferay> I'm very excited, I've never been
10:43 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> It's probably even better than having some Liferay training or something.
10:44 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Berlin is like every big city...bright and dark sides. ;)
10:44 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I actually moved here like 2 months ago, so I'm fairly new myself.
10:47 < hufg:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur: but great clubs and great vibe!
10:47 < hufg:#liferay> 8)
10:47 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> No idea. Not really my thing. ;)
10:48 < jardineworks:#liferay> rotty3000, are you speaking?
10:48 <@rotty3000:#liferay> yes
10:48 < jardineworks:#liferay> whats the topic?
10:48 <@rotty3000:#liferay> security/osgi
10:49 < jardineworks:#liferay> cool! will it be published online for all us poppers who won't make it to this one?
10:49 <@rotty3000:#liferay> I believe so
10:50 < jardineworks:#liferay> how many people are expected to attend?
10:52 <@rotty3000:#liferay> the goal is 350
10:52 < jardineworks:#liferay> one of these days I am going to hit up one of these events.
10:52 < jardineworks:#liferay> you need to start lobbying for one in Canada!
10:53 < jardineworks:#liferay> :)
10:53 <@rotty3000:#liferay> jardineworks: the Berlin DevCon is our first devcon, totally developer centric
10:53 <@rotty3000:#liferay> jardineworks: :)
10:53 <@rotty3000:#liferay> you never know
10:53 < jardineworks:#liferay> just not sudbury. Too many mosquitos.
10:53 < jardineworks:#liferay> :)
10:53 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> How come you chose Berlin?
10:53 <@rotty3000:#liferay> hahaha, I was thinking Winnipeg
10:53 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Aren't you all from the US?
10:53 < jardineworks:#liferay> LOL
10:54 < jardineworks:#liferay> there'd never be another one again
10:54 <@rotty3000:#liferay> jardineworks: j/k
10:54 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, Rotty and I are in Canada
10:54 < jardineworks:#liferay> I am in Toronto... he is in the middle of nowhere ;)
10:54 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> North America then. ;)
10:54 <@rotty3000:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur: yes, most of Liferay is in US, BUT most of our engineering is in Europe
10:54 < jardineworks:#liferay> i didn't know that
10:55 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Neither did I. Interesting.
10:55 < jardineworks:#liferay> i always assumed cali was a big presence for dev.
10:55 <@rotty3000:#liferay> our largest engineering office is Spain, then Brazil, then US
10:56 <@rotty3000:#liferay> bbib
11:23 < dave_k:#liferay> ... hmmm ... what would happen if I cluster two liferay/tomcat instances onto the same DB, but the instances are not allowed to talk on cluster link? (b/c of a paranoid network admin?)
11:24 < jardineworks:#liferay> dave_k, replication errors I would imagine
11:24 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> You would end up with the same mess I'm in right now. ;)
11:24 < jardineworks:#liferay> hahha
11:24 < jardineworks:#liferay> but you'd have a partner to work through it with!
11:25 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Yay! :D
11:26 < dave_k:#liferay> jardineworks: But would it actually diminish the functionality? (apart from doing the rendering work twice)
11:26 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> It would, because your cache would not recognize changes done on the other instance.
11:26 <@rotty3000:#liferay> dave_k: it would result in changes not being visible across nodes
11:26 <@rotty3000:#liferay> because one node would not be aware that it's caches are invalid
11:29 < dave_k:#liferay> okay, rotty3000 ... can I then do a static cluster link? i.e. not using multicast?
11:29 <@rotty3000:#liferay> yes
11:29 <@rotty3000:#liferay> I'm trying to find the info
11:30 < dave_k:#liferay> good, b/c I did not find it ...
11:30 < dave_k:#liferay> :)
11:32 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, that skinny code you sent me yesterday ... will that produce a map as a result?
11:33 <@jhf:#liferay> nope, but would be easy to fix it to do so.. right now it uses another class (which I didn't include) but its basically a map.
11:33 <@jhf:#liferay> so here lemme edit the gist real quick to show you an example
11:34 < jardineworks:#liferay> sorry.. I meant is the SkinnyJournalArticle just a map :)
11:34 < jardineworks:#liferay> or an object with a map
11:34 < jardineworks:#liferay> I mean
11:34 < jardineworks:#liferay> ugh --- I think I need a coffee
11:39 <@jhf:#liferay> ok updated https://gist.github.com/jamesfalkner/8726d3491a3f5b3a0ff2
11:39 <@jhf:#liferay> so if u call getArticleMap() it gives you a map of the values from the article
11:40 <@jhf:#liferay> be sure you import the right types
11:40 <@jhf:#liferay> import com.liferay.portal.kernel.xml.Document;
11:40 <@jhf:#liferay> import com.liferay.portal.kernel.xml.Element;
11:40 <@jhf:#liferay> import com.liferay.portal.kernel.xml.SAXReaderUtil;
11:40 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, cool -- but the thing is that I am trying to do this from a VM template with the regular web content portlet.  Is there a parser for XML in VM?
11:40 < jardineworks:#liferay> oh
11:40 < jardineworks:#liferay> I see
11:41 <@jhf:#liferay> you can call those methods via velocity, with some careful translation :)
11:41 < jardineworks:#liferay> oh i see, you are saying write my own plugin with that code and the service locator it?
11:42 <@jhf:#liferay> you could re-write the gist above in velocity if you want, without needing to deploy a java plugin
11:42 < hufg:#liferay> rotty3000: https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/blob/6.1.2-ga3/portal-impl/src/com/liferay/portal/staging/permission/StagingPermissionImpl.java#L77
11:42 < hufg:#liferay> there
11:42 < hufg:#liferay> that is the failing permission check
11:42 < hufg:#liferay> doesn't make much sense to me imo
11:42 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, what about a JournalArticleServiceLocalImplWrapper ... err, wait, that might be dangerous.
11:43 < hufg:#liferay> actionId is UPDATE, portletId 20, group is the live group thus. hasStagingGroup() -> true and portletId 20 is staged -> true ------> return false
11:43 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, ok -- forgive my VM n00bness. so I would create a VM macro with that logic and then call the macro to get back a map?
11:45 <@jhf:#liferay> that's one way to do it, but since I don't know much about macros I usually just write it inline. here are some tips:
11:45 <@jhf:#liferay> to make a new map in velocity: #set ($newmap = $portal.getClass().forName("java.util.HashMap").newInstance())
11:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, ok cool I get'ya
11:47 <@jhf:#liferay> to get a handle to a util class that's not already given to you via WCM template framework:
11:47 <@jhf:#liferay> #set ($saxUtil = $portal.getClass().forName("com.liferay.portal.kernel.xml.SAXReaderUtil"))
11:47 <@jhf:#liferay> err
11:47 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, one last question. Is there a faster way to develop templates? right now I am using the editor. I know I could use a file, but having to upload the file everytime doesn't seem faster than the editor. Both options suck.
11:47 <@jhf:#liferay> #set ($saxUtilClass = $portal.getClass().forName("com.liferay.portal.kernel.xml.SAXReaderUtil"))
11:48 <@jhf:#liferay> then $saxUtil.newInstance() to get an instance
11:48 <@jhf:#liferay> err
11:48 <@jhf:#liferay> $saxUtilClass.newInstance()
11:48 <@jhf:#liferay> jardineworks: heh, you're right about that. I'm doing a talk at devcon on this very subject
11:49 <@jhf:#liferay> so short answer is, out of the box, no there's no better way. what I do is use intellij IDEA
11:49 <@jhf:#liferay> it has auto-completion, code syntax checking/highlighting for velocity
11:49 <@jhf:#liferay> then I cut/paste into the editor
11:49 <@jhf:#liferay> BUT
11:50 <@jhf:#liferay> I'm developing a plugin that will let you manage your templates/structures via the document library, allowing you to mount (e.g. via webdav) and edit in place
11:50 <@jhf:#liferay> without having to use the built-in editor at all
11:50 < jardineworks:#liferay> that'd be nice
11:50 <@jhf:#liferay> Monator (a partner company in europe) has already developed a plugin for this, but only for use with custom SpringMVC portlets that use Freemarker as a view technology
11:50 <@jhf:#liferay> it doesn't do anything for the portal itself (e.g. the WCM templating system)
11:50 <@jhf:#liferay> see http://www.monator.com/blog/-/blogs/making-freemarker-templates-truly-flexible-with-liferay-document-and-media-library
11:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> alright. I'll just continue to grumpble for now.
11:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> :)
11:51 <@jhf:#liferay> I would seriously use an IDE to edit velocity
11:52 <@jhf:#liferay> it has made my life a lot easier
11:52 <@jhf:#liferay> intellij idea is free
11:52 < jardineworks:#liferay> it is?
11:52 < jardineworks:#liferay> I use eclipse
11:52 < hufg:#liferay> eclipse velocity plugin somewhat works
11:53 < jardineworks:#liferay> but I used to use Intellij a long time ago
11:53 < jardineworks:#liferay> v4 I think
11:54 <@jhf:#liferay> I think there is a velocity plugin for eclipse too
12:00 < hufg:#liferay> yes it somewhat works
12:00 < hufg:#liferay> i use a plugin
12:01 < hufg:#liferay> it can detect some syntax errors but not all 8)
12:03 <@rotty3000:#liferay> hufg: ok, that's good info about the error
12:03 <@rotty3000:#liferay> clearly to me that calling of the non-local method is the problem
12:16 < dave_k:#liferay> okay, last question for today: what happens if the cluster link is severed temporarily? I can envision two cases: Package loss on the link between two server hosting buildings and one instance going down/tomcat restarting.
12:25 < dave_k:#liferay> damn. gotta go. cya all!
13:29 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey jhf do you have a second for another VM question?
13:29 <@jhf:#liferay> sure
13:30 < jardineworks:#liferay> wait... just need to make sure its not stupid first :)
13:38 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, ok -- so this line ... #set ($authorArticle = $journalArticleLocalService.getArticle($groupId, $authorid))
13:39 < jardineworks:#liferay> both the scope id and author id have values.
13:39 < jardineworks:#liferay> the service has values
13:39 < jardineworks:#liferay> a value rather.
13:39 < jardineworks:#liferay> ... but if I outout $authorArticle I get just the name
13:39 < jardineworks:#liferay> and no stacktrace
13:40 <@jhf:#liferay> try to use $getterUtil.getLong($groupId) instead of $groupId
13:40 <@jhf:#liferay> also is it $authorid or $authorId
13:41 < jardineworks:#liferay> oh yeah!
13:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> negative :(
13:48 <@jhf:#liferay> hmm
13:48 <@jhf:#liferay> you sure articleId is correct (and is a string?)
13:48 <@jhf:#liferay> i.e. you can see the article via control panel?
13:48 <@jhf:#liferay> and it's not expired?
13:49 <@jhf:#liferay> also, you can try $journalArticleLocalService.getLatestArticle($getterUtil.getLong($groupId), $authorId)
13:50 < jardineworks:#liferay> oh
13:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> published and in control panel ... the line you said to try no dice.
13:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> I also tried getterUtil.getString($authorid) ... no dice.
13:52 <@jhf:#liferay> hmm
13:52 <@jhf:#liferay> how are you initializing journalArticleLocalService ?
13:52 <@jhf:#liferay> also, no errors in the log file?
13:52 <@jhf:#liferay> like a NoSuchArticleException perhaps?
13:53 < jardineworks:#liferay> #set ($journalArticleLocalService = $portalBeanLocator.locate("com.liferay.portlet.journal.service.JournalArticleLocalService.velocity"))
13:53 <@jhf:#liferay> and how are you initializing portalBeanLocator :)
13:53 <@jhf:#liferay> no errors in the log file?
13:53 < jardineworks:#liferay> nadda
13:54 <@jhf:#liferay> can u cut and paste the entire template into a private gist?
13:54 <@jhf:#liferay> (or public if ya want
13:54 < jardineworks:#liferay> hahah
13:54 < jardineworks:#liferay> fail
13:54 < jardineworks:#liferay> I commented out the user stuff we did yesterday... including the portal bean
13:55 < jardineworks:#liferay> that seems to be it
13:57 < jardineworks:#liferay> my lord VM coding is slow.
13:58 < jardineworks:#liferay> I use JRebel for regular development as a mechanism to speed up my efforts... I feel like this is 10 steps back
14:10 < hufg-home:#liferay> rotty3000: my main man, any news on that permission thingy? 8)
14:11 <@rotty3000:#liferay> just a comment from chief architect that it needs to be fixed
14:11 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah it's not the greatest. free marker is better. I mean it's a templating language, not a full blown dev environment (I called out this "caveat" at https://www.liferay.com/web/james.falkner/blog/-/blogs/writing-liferay-apps-with-web-content-templat-1 )
14:11 <@rotty3000:#liferay> the developer is not in our timezone, so it will take some time for him to respond
14:11 < hufg-home:#liferay> ok
14:12 <@jhf:#liferay> my most favorite thing about velocity apps is I don't have to deploy portlets :) which requires admin/IT intervention
14:12 <@rotty3000:#liferay> (I think he's currently in China)
14:12 < hufg-home:#liferay> i will tomorrow see if i can replicate the issue with a bundle
14:12 < hufg-home:#liferay> i suppose it should still happen without the upgrade?
14:12 < hufg-home:#liferay> ie. the upgrade is not the issue here
14:12 <@rotty3000:#liferay> hufg-home: exactly
14:27 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, Does that mean that, given the option, I should be opting for freemarker?
14:27 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Any of you up for another architectural discussion? I'm home so I finally can start thinking for once.
14:28 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, throw it out there
14:29 <@jhf:#liferay> so I don't know FM but all I've heard is it can do all that VM can do, and more, and that its awesome
14:29 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, ugh... your sample code uses recursion. Is VM actually capable of somethin like that?
14:29 <@jhf:#liferay> oh dang.. no it's not.
14:29 < jardineworks:#liferay> maybe with a macro?
14:29 <@jhf:#liferay> I doubt it.
14:29 < jardineworks:#liferay> shoot
14:30 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Ok...here it goes: I'm thinking about making our new entities stageable. What we will have is this: CP portlet to CRUD entities.  Then we will have portlets that can be embedded in any page and render a JSON there to be consumed by some JS. The portal is staged, so any changes to the entities should only be visible in those latter portlets, if the entities have been published.
14:30 < jardineworks:#liferay> well, in my case the strucutre is flat (underneath the root node) so maybe I can just do the one loop anyway.
14:31 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> After discussing with our content guy...it happens way more often that entities have to change. Pages are touch less often. So it would be best to have a "publish" button in the CP portlet.
14:32 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> What's the easier and more robust approach? Either we try leveraging Liferay's method of staging via groupId and whatnot...or we just have a "live" flag and the frontend portlet checks whether it's in staging or live to decide what to grab from the DB.
14:32 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> </wallOfText>
14:32 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, do your entities  have to be service builder? or could you model them as content? :)
14:32 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> We decided on doing it "properly" with entities for several reasons. So that won't change.
14:35 < jardineworks:#liferay> I would use the flag then
14:35 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Me too. Seems easier and less error-prone.
14:35 < jardineworks:#liferay> if your services enable remoting then the flag, in the future, would allow you to do something similar without Liferay internal knowledge like group id and staging logic.
14:36 < jardineworks:#liferay> less tightly coupled I think
14:36 < jardineworks:#liferay> if you were only using it internally and would never use it outside of LR, then I might consider the staging with group id for consistency.
14:37 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, http://freemarker.org/docs/ref_directive_visit.html
14:37 < jardineworks:#liferay> awesome
14:37 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> For now there will be the fronend portlet and a JSON interface to access the data.
14:37 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> But you are right...might be that something will be added to that.
14:38 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> And we explicitly defined that entities should not be published when a page is being published.
14:38 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> 100% control over what is going live...not magic stuff.
14:39 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> And it's perfectly possible to find out in a portlet if it's currently viewed in staging or in live, right?
14:50 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, That I don't know about. I haven't done anything with staging (yet)
14:51 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> If the dockbar is able to find out, so should my portlet. At least I hope so.
14:54 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, if this work, #set ($authormap = $portal.getClass().forName("java.util.HashMap").newInstance()) and I output $authormap and see {} then it means that I should be able to do $authormap.put( x, x ) right?
14:55 <@jhf:#liferay> yep
14:55 < jardineworks:#liferay> and if all my put statements are rendered in the template?
14:55 <@jhf:#liferay> you need to do this
14:55 < jardineworks:#liferay> then it means it fails the put?
14:55 <@jhf:#liferay> #set ($V = $authormap.put(x,x))
14:55 <@jhf:#liferay> V standing for "void"
14:55 <@jhf:#liferay> so that nothing is output in the result
14:56 <@jhf:#liferay> otherwise, you'll get things like "true" or "1" or something in random places
14:56 <@jhf:#liferay> whatever the return value of the .put is
14:56 < jardineworks:#liferay> hah wow... do you have any idea how much money you are saving my clients right now? :)
14:56 <@jhf:#liferay> I am keeping track
14:56 <@jhf:#liferay> what's your billing address?
14:56 < jardineworks:#liferay> so many beers I owe you and rotty
14:56 <@jhf:#liferay> :)
14:56 < jardineworks:#liferay> I hope you drink
14:56 <@jhf:#liferay> there's one gotcha with the .put lemme go look it up
14:56 <@jhf:#liferay> it took me forever to debug it
14:56 <@jhf:#liferay> indeed
14:57 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah for some reason when you call .get, if the "key" does not exist in the map, you still get something back
14:58 <@jhf:#liferay> so only call "get" after first ensuring the key is there, via $map.containsKey(key)
14:58 <@jhf:#liferay> I can't remember why but it really confused me
14:58 < jardineworks:#liferay> k
14:58 <@jhf:#liferay> so I have things like
14:58 <@jhf:#liferay>     #if ($pluginscontributed.containsKey($appuid))
14:58 <@jhf:#liferay>         #set ($appcount = $pluginscontributed.get($appuid))
14:58 <@jhf:#liferay>         #set ($appcount = $appcount + 1)
14:58 <@jhf:#liferay>         #set ($V = $pluginscontributed.put($appuid, $appcount))
14:58 <@jhf:#liferay>     #else
14:58 <@jhf:#liferay>         #set ($V = $pluginscontributed.put($appuid, 1))
14:58 <@jhf:#liferay>     #end
14:59 <@jhf:#liferay> meaning, I check that the pluginscontributed map has the appuid key first
14:59 <@jhf:#liferay> I wasn't able to do things like
14:59 <@jhf:#liferay> #set ($appcount = $pluginscontributed.get($appuid)
14:59 <@jhf:#liferay> #if ($appcount == null) #then ....
14:59 <@jhf:#liferay> because app count was never null
14:59 <@jhf:#liferay> it was annnoying
14:59 <@jhf:#liferay> maybe u can figure out why
14:59 <@jhf:#liferay> :)
15:00 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Probably a Velocity problem, because of the weird way it handles null values.
15:00 <@jhf:#liferay> yup
15:00 <@jhf:#liferay> I was getting back the value from the *last* time I called .get if the key did not exist
15:00 <@jhf:#liferay> which was like "wtf"
15:00 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Sounds about right.
15:00 < jardineworks:#liferay> hahah'
15:00 < jardineworks:#liferay> awesome
15:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> I would love to know what was going through the developers mind
15:01 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Because if the get didn't work or yields null, Velocity will actually ignore the entire statement, I think.
15:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> that sounds like something a disgruntled individual would do :)
15:01 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> So if you are reusing a variable, it will have the value from before.
15:02 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I learned to always do #set( $myVar = "" ) before I do anything with a variable.
15:02 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Just to prevent it from reusing a previous value.
15:05 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I guess Velocity wasn't meant for developers, but for...dunno...designers, content editors or whatever. People who don't care about stuff not working, as long as it doesn't break the layout. ;)
15:07 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> *sigh* I probably won't make it to the DevCon. I doubt I will get two days off for that when we have only like 8 weeks to rebuild the entire project.
15:08 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, you could use it as a excuse to pick the brains of LR people for nothing (or virtually nothing) which could mitigate some of your 8 week project risk
15:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> \o/
15:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> it's working!
15:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> thanks you so much guys
15:10 <@jhf:#liferay> \o/
15:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> this was one piece that I was really sweating
15:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> because I didn't see a way to link content items
15:11 <@jhf:#liferay> @Liferay @schtool @rotty3000 twitter IRC shoutout!
15:13 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf do you know how to use the serviceLocator stuff with freemarker?
15:13 <@jhf:#liferay> nope
15:22 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> You guys better bring warm clothes. It's cold in Berlin these days.
15:32 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, whats the temp in Berlin?
15:32 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Around 10° C at the moment.
15:33 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> It was stifling hot a few weeks ago...now winter is announcing itself.
15:34 <@rotty3000:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur: as long as the market in Prenzlauer Berg still opens on Sunday, I'll be happy, plus I'm from Canada, so it will likely be warmer than where I came from
15:35 <@rotty3000:#liferay> jhf: is something going on on Twitter?
15:35 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Can't tell you anything about Prenzlauer Berg...haven't been there yet. One of the directions I still have to go exploring. ;)
15:36 <@jhf:#liferay> rotty3000: uhh
15:36 <@jhf:#liferay> what do you mean?
15:36 <@jhf:#liferay> like, is it down?
15:36 <@rotty3000:#liferay> re the twitter shootout?
15:36 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> And I guess you're pretty used to low temps, yes...I usually don't mind them either, but the drop was to quick.
15:36 <@jhf:#liferay> ahh
15:36 <@jhf:#liferay> shoutout
15:36 <@jhf:#liferay> not shootout :)
15:37 <@rotty3000:#liferay> OH, reading typo :-D
15:37 <@rotty3000:#liferay> haha
15:37 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Good one, though. ;)
15:41 <@rotty3000:#liferay> sigh.. 4 app servers done, ~5 to go
15:41 <@rotty3000:#liferay> at 1 week per app server.. this is taking longer than I expected.
15:41 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, where did you move to Berlin from?
15:42 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> jardineworks: Dresden. Only like 250km or something.
15:47 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, I should have gone to Germany this summer. We did France which was a fail. It sucked worse than I thought it would.
15:48 < jardineworks:#liferay> we should have gone Scotland -> GERMANY -> Spain
15:48 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> France has some very lovely places to visit.
15:48 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Where did you go?
15:49 < jardineworks:#liferay> we went to all the wrong places. Paris -> Lyon -> Lamure sur azergu (for a wedding) -> Villefranche -> Mont Pellier
15:49 < jardineworks:#liferay> Mont Pellier was probably the nicest, and we were only there for a day or so
15:49 < jardineworks:#liferay> I would go back, but to the south only...
15:49 < jardineworks:#liferay> Paris is gross.
15:50 < jardineworks:#liferay> I don't see what all the fuss is about it
15:50 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> It has some nice sites, but I don't get the entire city of love stuff.
15:50 < jardineworks:#liferay> and I personally didn't find Parisians all that friendly. And it bothered me how snooty they are about their language.
15:51 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Well...that's something you have to expect. The French are weird like that.
15:51 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> And in general Paris is just another big city.
15:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> I speak French. Its not PERFECT because I don't live in France. But I don't sound like a tourist. Everytime I spoke to them they would try to answer me in English as if my French was terrible ( the look on their faces ... epic )... but their English was worse! lol
15:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> true
15:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> I didn't find the places we went very friendly for children.
15:52 < jardineworks:#liferay> and my son is 3
15:52 < jardineworks:#liferay> sooooooooo... kind of important
15:52 < jardineworks:#liferay> I heard Germany is an awesome place to visit with kids.
15:52 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I don't know about that...not having kids myself...but Germany is quite versatile. A lot of different kinds of places to visit.
15:53 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> You can pretty much find something enjoyable for everyone, I think.
15:54 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> And I would always recommend Dresden over Berlin to be honest. ;)
15:54 < jardineworks:#liferay> no bias of course
15:55 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Berlin is just a big city. Surprisingly green during the summer, but in general not particularly pretty.
15:55 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Not biased at all, no. ;)
15:57 <@rotty3000:#liferay> I also hated Paris
15:57 <@rotty3000:#liferay> when I was there 2 years ago, we were accosted 3 times in 2 days
15:57 <@rotty3000:#liferay> My wife swore we would never go back
15:57 <@rotty3000:#liferay> then we spent 1 week in Hamburg, it was Awesome!
15:58 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Hamburg is great. I love it.
15:59 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> And people in the northern part of Germany are of a very friendly mindset in general, I would say.
16:00 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Often a little grumpy, but friendly.
16:03 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey I'm like that!
16:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> maybe I should move to Germany :)
16:05 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> *lol* Somebody actually told me that I would be well off moving to Canada.
16:05 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Because I was complaining about the big temperature differences we have over here.
16:06 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> He even mentioned a particular part of Canada, but I forgot which one. And I'm pretty bad at north american geography anyway...
16:07 <@rotty3000:#liferay> :)
16:07 <@rotty3000:#liferay> the temp variance here has increased over the past couple years..
16:07 <@rotty3000:#liferay> it's not rare to see more than 30 degree from one day to the next
16:08 <@rotty3000:#liferay> I recall in early spring we actually had one day -10C, and the next was like +29C
16:09 <@jhf:#liferay> if it drops below 75F here, people break out sweaters and light fires
16:09 <@rotty3000:#liferay> yeah
16:09 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> ;)
16:10 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I would say that over here the weather has become more...extreme over the last years as well.
16:10 <@rotty3000:#liferay> I always love checking the Californians when I visit in early december, it's like between 10C and 20C and everyone is like wearing winter cloths like in Canada, when it's -10C
16:11 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Well...usually I wouldn't be cold when it's 10° C. But because it was a lot warmer just recently, it feels like much less than 10° C.
16:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, In this country, the weather is a topic of conversation... always. It's like the first thing you talk about when you meet someone new.
16:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> rotty3000, Calgary has the wackiest weather with those shinooks
16:13 < jardineworks:#liferay> Skiing on January 23, golfing on January 24th... its bananas
16:13 <@rotty3000:#liferay> yeah
16:13 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Over here it's considered a little bit uncreative to talk about the weather. ;D But it's a preferred topic to complain about...and Germans are a bunch of very proficient complainers...
16:14 < jardineworks:#liferay> I lived in LA for about 6 months and it was awesome that the weather was so nice all the time, but I personally, lost all concept of time. I think Canadians need seasons and temperatures to figure out what time of the year it is. :)
16:15 < jardineworks:#liferay> weather is illogical and Germans are logical. Makes sense that they would complain about the weather :)
16:15 <@rotty3000:#liferay> I have never been there, but my youngest brother was stationed  at CFB Shilo https://maps.google.ca/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=Shilo,+Manitoba&aq=0&oq=Shilo+manitoba&sll=46.471916,-81.219177&sspn=1.182231,3.043213&vpsrc=6&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=Shilo,+Division+No.+7,+Manitoba&ll=46.103709,-95.141602&spn=19.043837,48.691406&t=m&z=5
16:15 <@rotty3000:#liferay> and it may not seem like far north, but it's open plain. and the weather apparently gets SO COLD, like -50C
16:16 <@rotty3000:#liferay> if your dog runs away today, you can still see it running away tomorrow
16:16 <@rotty3000:#liferay> cause the land is so flat
16:16 < jardineworks:#liferay> rotty3000, my last few years in Ottawa it was -54 for two weeks in January (with the wind chill) ... that was when I said f it... I am outta here@
16:16 < jardineworks:#liferay> !
16:16 <@rotty3000:#liferay> haha
16:16 <@rotty3000:#liferay> yeah
16:16 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Dresden gets -20° C for about one week every year. That's quite cold enough for me and still a lot colder than it every gets around here in Berlin.
16:17 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> *ever
16:17 < jardineworks:#liferay> I have a buddy that works here: http://www.google.ca/imgres?imgurl=http://www.mining.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/DE-IMGP4342.jpg&imgrefurl=http://www.mining.com/diavik-diamond-mine/&h=4672&w=3104&sz=7341&tbnid=MrIQur-jYYD9KM:&tbnh=108&tbnw=72&zoom=1&usg=__avIEM94fyD5xqgp0LxPXKtVMiO4=&docid=KF3XPyqKsu9mBM&sa=X&ei=nls7Usu7KMiMyQHY84DgDQ&ved=0CHQQ9QEwDQ&dur=458
16:17 < jardineworks:#liferay> he flies in for two weeks, then comes home to Penetang for 2 weeks.
16:18 <@rotty3000:#liferay> :) fun!
16:18 < jardineworks:#liferay> now THAT is the end of the earth
16:18 < jardineworks:#liferay> lol
16:18 <@rotty3000:#liferay> good pay though
16:18 <@rotty3000:#liferay> yeah for sure
16:18 < jardineworks:#liferay> industrial electrician... about 120k a year
16:18 < jardineworks:#liferay> still doesn't seem like enough to go THERE.
16:18 < jardineworks:#liferay> It looks like a sink hole!
16:18 <@rotty3000:#liferay> I used to be an industrial mechanic
16:18 < jardineworks:#liferay> really?!
16:18 <@rotty3000:#liferay> :) yup
16:19 < jardineworks:#liferay> and now you are a software arch? that sounds like a good beer story
16:19 <@rotty3000:#liferay> actually, that career is still older than my new one
16:19 <@rotty3000:#liferay> in terms of length I was doing it
16:19 <@rotty3000:#liferay> it's a pretty good story
16:20 <@rotty3000:#liferay> .. does involve some pain and suffering, but with a happy ending :)
16:20 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Every good story needs plenty of all these things. ;)
16:20 <@rotty3000:#liferay> I usually have to tell it to the new people who joined the company whenever we have a company retreat
16:21 <@rotty3000:#liferay> it's almost a tradition
16:21 <@rotty3000:#liferay> oddly, I still fancy the smell of grease
16:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> hahah
16:22 < jardineworks:#liferay> well, I wanna hear it, but wait until I meet you at a symposium and I can buy you some of the 400 beers I owe you
16:22 <@rotty3000:#liferay> haha
16:22 <@rotty3000:#liferay> sure thing
16:24 < jardineworks:#liferay> curious... do people at LR call you rotty or ray?
16:25 < jardineworks:#liferay> I feel like if we met I woul dhave to call you rotty
16:25 < jardineworks:#liferay> lol
16:27 <@rotty3000:#liferay> :) Ray actually, although I do occasionally get a rotty or two
16:27 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> It's always strange to meet people you met online. ;)
16:28 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> A good friend of mine still keeps calling me "Tar" when he calls me. *lol*
16:28 <@rotty3000:#liferay> you never really get the image just right :)
16:28 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> He just can't get around to actually using my real name.
16:29 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, What is your actual reasly name?
16:29 < jardineworks:#liferay> real*
16:29 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Till.
16:29 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Way easier to remember than my nick. ;D
16:30 < jardineworks:#liferay> hahah I jsut remember the first three letters and autocomplete the rest
16:30 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Quite reasonable to do that. ;D
16:34 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Are people as unreasonable over in Canada as they are here? As soon as it starts getting colder, people tend to refuse to wear proper clothes. Result: Office is almost half empty, because half of the staff is sick.
16:35 <@rotty3000:#liferay> haha, (this might come off insulting, but it's not supposed to be) that mostly occurs with children
16:36 <@rotty3000:#liferay> it seems I can drive through town (we don't call them cities here) and all the young folk are shivering on the sidewalks
16:37 <@rotty3000:#liferay> too "cool" to dress warmly
16:37 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Winter clothes are not cool...exactly.
16:37 <@rotty3000:#liferay> :)
16:37 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Which is pretty ridiculous from a language point of view. :D
16:38 <@rotty3000:#liferay> exactly :)
16:38 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Well...over here the first wave of colds, coughs and worse illnesses usually announces the arrival of autumn. :D
16:39 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> People stop shaking hands for a while...and then everything returns to normal. :D
16:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> LOL
16:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> to clarify... we do have cities in Canada... just not where rotty lives ;)
16:46 <@rotty3000:#liferay> hahaha
16:46 <@rotty3000:#liferay> we have one or two
16:47 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I do know large parts of Canada are pretty much empty. ;)
16:47 <@rotty3000:#liferay> I have to think in terms of China as we have team there who I communicate with and their idea of a town and city is very different
16:47 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> That's one of the reasons I wish to come and visit at some point.
16:48 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> But there are soooo many places I wish to see...a very long list.
16:48 <@rotty3000:#liferay> I live in a town of 1000 people, the nearby city.. is 150k people.. maybe
16:48 < jardineworks:#liferay> 90% of this country is baron Tar-Minyatur ...if you look at a map of this country about 80% of the population live within 100 miles of the US border.
16:49 <@rotty3000:#liferay> next largest city is 500km away (toronto)
16:50 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I grew up in a town with about 800 people. ;)
16:52 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> That's probably why until today I prefer some quiet time over a noisy party.
16:52 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Much harder to find here in Berlin.
16:56 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, I work from home now but for years I was in the office... usually the loudest guy, or one of them anyway. Now there are some days where I don't even play music... I just sit quietly by myself and work. My wife thinks that I am weird because I enjoy the silence so much. I tell her that before having a child I never appreciated how nice QUIET actually was.
16:58 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Quiet can be very soothing.
16:59 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I always wait for the first snow every year. Then I take a long walk through the woods and enjoy the silence.
16:59 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> If that makes me weird...I just don't care. I still love it. :)
16:59 <@rotty3000:#liferay> I work from home quietly
16:59 <@rotty3000:#liferay> and listen to music in headphones 99% of the time
17:00 <@rotty3000:#liferay> because my wife also works from home, and listenes to different music
17:00 <@rotty3000:#liferay> we work in the same office
17:00 <@rotty3000:#liferay> it's peaceful
17:00 < jardineworks:#liferay> I have racoons that live under my office ... so I BLAST my music when I am grumpy and decide I hate them. :)
17:00 < jardineworks:#liferay> sometimes I'll pick the worst stuff I can, put it on at 110dB and then go for a walk :D
17:01 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I work at a media agency...lots of people on the same floor...usually quite noisy. When I have to concentrate I need to use headphones...no other way.
17:01 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Not a particularly good setup for a software developer to be honest.
17:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, what agency do you work for? a big one?
17:02 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I'm not an agency guy...can't say how well known they are. I'm working for Razorfish.
17:02 < jardineworks:#liferay> Razorfish... I think they have a Toronto office
17:03 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Probably. They have offices all over the world.
17:03 < jardineworks:#liferay> Pretty sure I know people who used to work there (a few years ago now mind you)
17:03 < jardineworks:#liferay> Agencies are difficult to work for as a programmer -- mostly because of creatives :)
17:03 < jardineworks:#liferay> they have no concept of deadlines or estimation.
17:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> my wife is a designer and I bug her about it ALL the time
17:04 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I really needed a change a while ago...and coming here fit that requirement perfectly.
17:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> you do get to build some cool stuff though. Much more exciting that traditional consulting.
17:05 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Actually...I feel like deadlines are much tougher now than on my last project.
17:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> I've worked for all manner of companies. I never showcased any of my "consulting" gigs... but the creative stuff? I used to share that stuff all the time
17:05 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Because in digital media you can't waste time.
17:06 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Yeah. My last project was some boring, but very complex intranet application.
17:06 < jardineworks:#liferay> sure, but I have always found that it was because the creatives were always late with their shit and the timeline could never be extended.
17:06 < jardineworks:#liferay> looks like RF dropped Canada from the roster.
17:07 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I'm working with our London office at the moment.
17:08 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> It's kinda nice to have this network. Feels like there are more possibilities.
17:10 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> And I enjoy having colleagues from different countries right here in the agency. Finally I have a chance to speak English on a regular basis.
17:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> well boys, that's it for me for today. Gotta go get jr. Thanks gain for the help with VM.
17:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> have a good night
17:10 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Bye. :)
17:10 <@rotty3000:#liferay> g.n :)
