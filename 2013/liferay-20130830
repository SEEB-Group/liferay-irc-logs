06:21 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> hi, i'm getting "login-portlet-6.1.1.1.war does not support this version of Liferay" error while deploying
06:21 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> can anyone tell me what is there to be done?
06:38 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> The portlet.xml (I think) contains a setting that specifies the Liferay version it's been written for.
06:38 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> If that doesn't match your Liferay version, the plugin won't work.
06:39 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> (Liferay being a more recent version than the portlet is usually ok.)
06:41 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> @Tar-Minyatur so if i change the version in that it should work right?
06:42 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> It would not be refused by Liferay...whether it WORKS is a completely different story.
06:49 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> right now i've changed the version in liferay-portlet.xml and still the issue remains
07:58 <@jhf:#liferay> bijoo: !

10:07 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> is there a portlet that shows a tabbed GUI?
10:09 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> what i need is like there will a navigation GUI on the left which can be configurable, upon clicking on the navigation item, through IPC the navidation portlet will send the URL to show, which the tab portlet will show in an iframe or something.
10:10 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> * navigation
11:58 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, are you around?
11:58 <@jhf:#liferay> yessir
