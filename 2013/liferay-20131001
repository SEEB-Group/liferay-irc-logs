02:38 < hufg:#liferay> helloo helloo
02:39 < hufg:#liferay> journal transformers are executed when a journal article is rendered right?
02:39 < hufg:#liferay> what happens if i get fetch an article through the api
02:54 < hufg:#liferay> mm at a glance the api should use the transformers
07:59 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Hi guys. Anyone have experience with Liferay permissions?
07:59 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I'm trying to set up a site role that is allowed to add only a few specific portlets to pages.
08:00 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I saw a permission "add to page" for "Web content display", but activating that doesn't do anything. When I assign "update page", the user can see all the portlets.
08:31 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey Tar-Minyatur .. are you trying to restrict custom portlets? or OOTB ones?
08:33 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I finally managed it.
08:34 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Apparently I forgot to hit that "Clean Up Permissions" button.
08:34 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> And I moved from a site role to a regular role.
08:34 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Now my user sees only "Web Content Display" when openening the "Add" menu on a page.
08:35 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Is it possible to restrict the visible web content structures as well?
08:38 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, OOTB I don't think so, but I believe there is a plugin in the market place that allows you to perform permissions per structure. let me find it.
08:38 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> To me it looks like I can set permissions per structure.
08:39 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Oh yeah.
08:39 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> That actually works.
08:39 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Niiiice.
08:44 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, oh right... sorry I was thinking of Workflow.
08:44 < jardineworks:#liferay> there is one workflow for web content but someone wrote a plugin that allows you to have a workflow pre structure I think
08:49 < hufg:#liferay> helloo helloo
09:30 < kiuma:#liferay> hello
09:32 < kiuma:#liferay> I'm trying to use portal.ctx=/intranet because I'd like everything under /intranet context path, but it seems not to be sufficient. what else should I set ?
09:36 < kiuma:#liferay> ping rotty3000
09:37 <@rotty3000:#liferay> kiuma: you need to also change the context.xml files in the app server
09:37 <@rotty3000:#liferay> that part is app server dependent
09:37 < kiuma:#liferay> ah thanks
09:37 <@rotty3000:#liferay> in 6.2 that internal Liferay setting is gone, and only changes at the app server level are required
09:37 <@rotty3000:#liferay> .. as it should be
09:38 < kiuma:#liferay> I'm still with 6.1.1
09:38 <@rotty3000:#liferay> yup
09:38 <@rotty3000:#liferay> just letting you know
09:38 <@rotty3000:#liferay> for posterity
09:38 < kiuma:#liferay> thx a lot
09:39 < kiuma:#liferay> I'll switch on it the next project... I think
09:46 < kiuma:#liferay> why do I have a 404 on http://localhost:8080/intranet/html/css/main.css?browserId=firefox&themeId=lmtheme_WAR_nexttheme....
09:46 < kiuma:#liferay> ?
09:47 < kiuma:#liferay> rotty3000, I've a 404 also on url like /intranet/image/journal/article?img_id=.....
09:47 < kiuma:#liferay> it there something else I have to set ?
09:48 <@rotty3000:#liferay> did you rename the context file, set the correct context path name, and also rename the folder of Liferay's war?
09:49 < kiuma:#liferay> hugh so many things ?
09:49 < kiuma:#liferay> I just set <Context path="/intranet">...
09:50 <@rotty3000:#liferay> you also have to change the name of the xml file itself
09:50 <@rotty3000:#liferay> and then rename the webapp folder
09:50 <@rotty3000:#liferay> the app server would have done that itself if using the deploy tools
09:51 < kiuma:#liferay> ok
10:05 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Guys, is it possible to create a new portlet based on an existing one? We need some additional features in the Web Content Display.
10:06 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Especially we would like the portlet to show a list of all the available structures, if no content is selected, and if clicked a new article based on the structure should be created and linked to the portlet.
10:07 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, If I understand you, the portlet does that already. You cliek the little paper with a + and it will open the create content window and from there you can pick your structure and template.
10:08 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Yeah. But that's "too complicated".
10:08 < jardineworks:#liferay> :|
10:08 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> And the name is also offensive apparently.
10:08 < jardineworks:#liferay> it's one more click.
10:08 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> People want to have it called "Page Module".
10:08 < jardineworks:#liferay> offensive?
10:08 < jardineworks:#liferay> The name can probably be changed with the language bundles.
10:08 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> "offensive" in a way that it totally disrupts the usability.
10:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> fucking IAs
10:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> they drive me insane
10:09 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> At least that's the common opinion outside of the technical department.
10:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> "That isn't the best user experience"
10:09 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Well...to be honest, Liferay was a really bad choice for this project.
10:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> like its a science. USER EXPERIENCE is subjective. What you think is amazing I might think is ridiculous.
10:09 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> It's way too complex for a simple "we need to build pages from modules" kind of application.
10:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> well, you could probably do a JSP override to change the default view for the portlet
10:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> meaning, change the logic so that if it is not configured, don't render the message, render a drop down with the structures in it.
10:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> or :)
10:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> you could maybe default the state when it is added to the page to EDIT mode :D
10:11 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Mhm.
10:12 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> If we would leave them to it, they would probably write into the concept, that the user should be able to directly select a structure from the "Add" menu on top of the page.
10:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> chances are you want to render the drop down and the onChange, route the user to edit mode with the structure pre-selected or something right?
10:12 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> That's pretty much all that is being used on our site...web content displays.
10:13 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> And every single article is associated with exactly one page.
10:13 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Never more.
10:13 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> It will probably not even be a drop down, but a list of links.
10:13 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> (One click less you know...)
10:13 < jardineworks:#liferay> so you have something like http://www.blah.com/pages/[structure]/[title]
10:14 < jardineworks:#liferay> the onchange event can  cause a submit :)
10:14 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I think our main problem is that Liferay is focused on content, while our project is entirely focused on pages.
10:16 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I don't know yet what I'll do about that...but I guess a Hook is easier than "extending" the original portlet and create a new one from it.
10:18 < jardineworks:#liferay> I would try a hook first. There is a lot of logic I don't think you want to try to reproduce.
10:18 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Do I need to reproduce it?
10:19 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> When I create a new Portlet, I usually extend MVCPortlet.
10:19 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Couldn't I instead try extending the Web Content Display portlet?
10:20 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Mhm. But then I would have to replicate the folder structure and the JSPs etc. anyway.
10:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> not sure that would work
10:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> different application context.
10:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> but I have never tried it to be honest.
10:21 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I guess I'll go with a hook.
10:21 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> It's a pretty minor modification anyway.
10:21 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> And I could do the properties override to change the name this way as well.
10:34 < kiuma:#liferay> why do I have so many [http-bio-8080-exec-1][ThemeLocalServiceImpl:149] No theme found for specified theme id lmtheme_WAR_nexttheme. Returning the default theme.
10:34 < kiuma:#liferay> ?
10:35 < kiuma:#liferay> now that I've changed the context ?
14:14 < bnd123us:#liferay> test
14:41 < _bj:#liferay> hello guys :)
14:41 < _bj:#liferay> I've been experience that importing user from LDAP into Liferay makes the login with these users VERY slow..
14:41 < _bj:#liferay> any ideas?
14:41 < _bj:#liferay> Liferay 6.1
14:42 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Are you sure that it's not the LDAP that is being particularly slow when used for authentication?
14:43 < _bj:#liferay> hm that might be possible
14:44 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Seems like the obvious place to look first.
14:44 < _bj:#liferay> Don't have the systems in front of me right now, just investigating some reasons
14:46 < _bj:#liferay> just found this http://www.liferay.com/community/forums/-/message_boards/message/16936724 :)
15:29 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur,  you there?
15:30 < jardineworks:#liferay> maybe jhf? quick structure question if you guys have a second
15:30 <@jhf:#liferay> I can try
15:30 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I'm here, yes.
15:30 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> But I go with jhf on that. ;D
15:32 < jardineworks:#liferay> I am doing this right now... ugh... nevermind, I think I just got it
15:32 < jardineworks:#liferay> I didn't realize that a JournalStructure had getId, getPrimaryKey and getStructureId :S
15:33 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Liferay is definitely ID-rich. :D
15:33 < jardineworks:#liferay> and parentid.
15:34 < jardineworks:#liferay> lol
15:34 < jardineworks:#liferay> i thought the structureId was the Id, but I guess not.
15:35 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Did you find out what that one belongs to?
15:43 <@jhf:#liferay> structureIds aren't ordinary ids - they are just strings
15:43 <@jhf:#liferay> not longs like many other ids
15:43 <@jhf:#liferay> they aren't the primary key either
15:44 <@jhf:#liferay> the primary keys are the "Id"s
16:01 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Is the structureId what you see on the UI?
16:02 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Which can be set manually or autogenerated depending on the settingsß
16:02 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> ?
17:15 < jardineworks:#liferay> Have you guys ever seen a bunch of stuff come after a search-container? in my case Article details... even though I haven't asked for them?
17:16 < jardineworks:#liferay> like this --
17:16 < jardineworks:#liferay> <dynamic-element index-type="" type="document_library" name="carousel_item_image" instance-id="4WXkQh4A" id="aui_3_4_0_1_1757">
