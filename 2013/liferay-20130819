09:44 < Tar-Minyatur> *sigh* Hi guys. Anyone got an idea why the same code I use to load web content from within a template works for one web content, but not for another?
09:45 < Tar-Minyatur> I'm really confused right now. Almost feels as if the web content is broken somehow...
09:45 < Tar-Minyatur> #set( $content = $journalContentUtil.getContent($group_id, $contentId, $viewMode, "$locale", "") )
09:45 < Tar-Minyatur> That's the line I'm using. I obtain the $group_id this way: #set( $group_id = $getterUtil.getLong($request.theme-display.scope-group-id) )
09:46 < Tar-Minyatur> The $contentID contains the custom ID defined when the web content article was created.
09:48 < Tar-Minyatur> http://pastie.org/private/dqtzsoetnpxmdy8a8cukaa
09:48 < Tar-Minyatur> That's the entire template.
09:56 <@jhf> Tar-Minyatur: looking @ template
09:56 <@jhf> so what happens - it just prints out the statement, literally?
09:57 <@jhf> and where do you define $journalContentUtil - or is that one of the built-in ones?
09:57 <@jhf> also I think you need to use $contentId.data not just $contentId
09:58 <@jhf> and $viewMode.data
09:58 <@jhf> (assuming these are structure field names)
09:58 <@jhf> also, to be safe, use $getterUtil.getLong($contentId.data) to be sure it's a long
09:59 <@jhf> because I think it's a string by default (again assuming these are structure fields)
10:00 <@jhf> ah wait - you're using macros and passing in .data properly.  except for viewMode
10:01 <@jhf> ah crap - viewMode also biult in.
10:01 <@jhf> is your template set to not be "cacheable" ?
10:02 < Tar-Minyatur> Let me check.
10:03 < Tar-Minyatur> Oh. It's cacheable.
10:03 < Tar-Minyatur> Will it clear the cache automatically when I remove the flag?
10:03 <@jhf> yeah it should
10:03 < Tar-Minyatur> Or do I have to do that by hand?
10:03 < Tar-Minyatur> Ok. Then that wasn't the problem. ;)
10:04 <@jhf> also, is <!-- a valid way to comment in velocity?
10:04 < Tar-Minyatur> I just get the log output that it couldn't be loaded.
10:04 < Tar-Minyatur> It's a comment meant to appear in the HTML output.
10:04 <@jhf> ahhh
10:04 < Tar-Minyatur> Because I can't access the logfiles on all our machines. :-/
10:04 <@jhf> yeah....
10:05 < Tar-Minyatur> I'll explain again what's happening:
10:05 < Tar-Minyatur> I have three web content articles.
10:05 < Tar-Minyatur> And I have two pages with each one having a template.
10:05 < Tar-Minyatur> One of the pages uses the template you saw.
10:05 < Tar-Minyatur> The other one has a similar one, but the web content request is a little more complicated. The line actually getting it is the same though.
10:06 < Tar-Minyatur> When I set a content ID in the web content article via a structure field, the template you saw doesn't load anything.
10:08 < Tar-Minyatur> On the other page, however, it works perfectly fine for some articls. But not for all of them.
10:08 < Tar-Minyatur> Some just can't be loaded.
10:08 < Tar-Minyatur> Btw...staging is active for web content.
10:09 < Tar-Minyatur> But all articles have been part of a published page at some point and SHOULD be on live.
10:10 <@jhf> hmm.. if you view the live page, does it work?
10:10 < Tar-Minyatur> The article shows up in the asset publisher portlet btw.
10:10 < Tar-Minyatur> No. Works neither in Live or on Staging.
10:11 <@jhf> hmm.. try replacing $contentId (in the loadWebContent macro) with $getterUtil.getLong($contentId)
10:11 <@jhf> also, I assume setting cacheable to false did not work?
10:11 < Tar-Minyatur> No. Didn't do anything.
10:12 < Tar-Minyatur> And the ID thingy isn't an ID actually.
10:12 < Tar-Minyatur> Autogeneration is off and I put a custom ID in there.
10:12 <@jhf> ah right
10:12 <@jhf> looking at the javascript
10:12 < Tar-Minyatur> (Because 12324 just looks odd in a web content input field...)
10:12 <@jhf> err
10:13 <@jhf> not javascript
10:13 <@jhf> java*doc*
10:13 <@jhf> http://docs.liferay.com/portal/6.1/javadocs/com/liferay/portlet/journalcontent/util/JournalContentUtil.html
10:13 < Tar-Minyatur> Yeah. I was very confused at the ID being a string.
10:13 <@jhf> yeah.. poor naming
10:13 < Tar-Minyatur> But I guess in some circumstances it really can be beneficial.
10:13 <@jhf> because almost everything else in LR that have Id in it is a long of some kind
10:14 <@jhf> groupId, etc.
10:14 < Tar-Minyatur> Like when your content guys think it a good thing to type content IDs into structure fields instead of using asset publisher.
10:14 <@jhf> so what I would do is look at the values that you are passing for groupId, contentId, and look in the DB to see if it's right
10:15 < Tar-Minyatur> Oh right. I'm working locally at the moment, so I actually CAN access the database. Why didn't I think of that? :D
10:15 <@jhf> and also are you sure the $teaser1-content-id.data is coming out right? I remember one time I used hyphens in identifiers, and velocity interpreted it as a mathematical subtraction operator.
10:15 < Tar-Minyatur> The ID shows up correctly in the log output.
10:15 <@jhf> ok
10:16 <@jhf> yeah then I'm guessing it's due to staging/live and groupId differences therein
10:16 <@jhf> thats all I got for now
10:16 <@jhf> or permissions
10:16 < Tar-Minyatur> Maybe scope ID is not the right field?
10:16 < Tar-Minyatur> Should I use the parentGroupID instead?
10:17 < Tar-Minyatur> Oh. The asset publisher doesn't show the web content articles on live either.
10:17 <@jhf> no that's probably blank/null anyway, unless you are using hierarchical organizations
10:17 < Tar-Minyatur> So I guess they are NOT published despite what I thought?
10:17 <@jhf> depends on if you checked off that option when setting up staging
10:17 < Tar-Minyatur> I should find two entries with the same ID and different group IDs, if they are live, right? In the DB I mean.
10:18 <@jhf> I'm not sure if the IDs are the same or not. rotty3000 would know.
10:18 <@jhf> I know the structureIds are different though
10:18 <@jhf> not sure about the content Ids
10:18 < Tar-Minyatur> Well...they are custom, so they should be the same.
10:19 <@jhf> yeah.. good point.
10:20 <@rotty3000> can I get a short version of the story?
10:20 <@jhf> template not showing content properly via a call to  $journalContentUtil
10:20 <@jhf> syntax looks good
10:21 <@jhf> http://pastie.org/private/dqtzsoetnpxmdy8a8cukaa
10:21 <@jhf> it's a staging environment
10:21 <@jhf> this line returns nil
10:21 <@jhf> 	#set( $content = $journalContentUtil.getContent($group_id, $contentId, $viewMode, "$locale", "") )
10:21 <@jhf> (note: this is in a macro definition)
10:21 <@jhf> other, similar template works fine
10:21 <@jhf> template is not cached
10:22 < Tar-Minyatur> I can see the article twice in the DB with the Group IDs I get in the log output for Live and Staging. Looks like the article has been published.
10:22 <@rotty3000> can you change the argument "" for $xmlRequest
10:23 < Tar-Minyatur> I can, but I had some trouble with that when I started building this. Whenever I put it in, it didn't work anymore.
10:24 < Tar-Minyatur> Something is wrong here. What the hell...I added an asset publisher to the page an published it. It doesn't show up live.
10:24 < Tar-Minyatur> Just wanted to check if the article would appear in there...
10:25 < Tar-Minyatur> Oh. Damn. Scope setting. -.-
10:25 < Tar-Minyatur> Too many settings!
10:27 <@rotty3000> without an $xmlRequest, the line:                boolean lifecycleRender = isLifecycleRender(themeDisplay, xmlRequest);    will return false, and will likely return null content
10:27 < Tar-Minyatur> It works on another page with another article just fine.
10:27 <@rotty3000> note, the themeDisplay in your case is already null
10:28 <@rotty3000> probably because the article is already in the journalContentUtil's cache
10:28 < Tar-Minyatur> Adding $xmlRequest in there didn't change anything.
10:29 < Tar-Minyatur> Why would themeDisplay be null?
10:29 <@jhf> shouldn't un-checking the cacheable option in the UI reset the cache? or do you need to manually clear it via CP->System Admin
10:30 <@rotty3000> there is  no themeDisplay object within web content templates
10:30 <@rotty3000> see the logic leading up to the call to getArticleDisplay: https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/blob/6.1.x/portal-impl/src/com/liferay/portlet/journalcontent/util/JournalContentImpl.java#L161
10:31 <@jhf> $journalContentUtil.getContent does not require a true ThemeDisplay instance though...
10:31 < Tar-Minyatur> Mhm. When I built this I frequently had the log output themeDisplay.
10:31 <@rotty3000> the logic is such that it either uses a themeDisplay OR the $xmlRequest
10:32 <@rotty3000> are you calling this code from the theme?
10:32 < Tar-Minyatur> Anyway. I only need themeDisplay to get the groupId.
10:32 <@rotty3000> or from another web content template?
10:32 < Tar-Minyatur> Is there another way to get that?
10:32 < Tar-Minyatur> The code is a web content template.
10:32 < Tar-Minyatur> Meant to be anyway. ;)
10:32 <@rotty3000> so yeah, there is no real themeDisplay object in that context
10:33 < Tar-Minyatur> Fine with me. Can I get the groupId from somewhere else inside a template?
10:33 <@rotty3000> only themeDisplay available there is a serialized version in Map form as a property of the $request Map
10:33 <@jhf> yeah from which he is getting the scopeGroupId
10:33 <@rotty3000> $groupId
10:34 <@rotty3000> yeah, the scopeGroupId is the groupId you are looking for in 99% of cases
10:34 <@jhf> yeah, so 	#set( $group_id = $getterUtil.getLong($request.theme-display.scope-group-id) ) should work correctly
10:34 <@rotty3000> exactly
10:35 <@rotty3000> however, you should still pass the $xmlRequest to the $journalContent.getDisplay(...) methods
10:36 < Tar-Minyatur> I changed the way I obtain the group ID and added the xmlRequest.
10:36 <@rotty3000> because it's used internally to populate request data into the transformation pipeline
10:36 < Tar-Minyatur> Still no change.
10:36 <@jhf> hey Tar-Minyatur can we see the template that "works" ?
10:36 < Tar-Minyatur> It only works sort-off. Because it can't work with all articles.
10:36 < Tar-Minyatur> No idea why.
10:37 < Tar-Minyatur> http://pastie.org/private/hxeespo1edsu88ktkdtz6w
10:38 < Tar-Minyatur> It's pretty much the same.
10:38 <@jhf> also, one high level question - why not just use asset publisher to show the articles, instead of a template that retrieves the articles and shows them?
10:38 < Tar-Minyatur> Because the content guys are used to editing web content articles and filling out the structure forms.
10:38 < Tar-Minyatur> And they don't want that to change. -.-
10:39 <@jhf> ah and by "forms" you mean DDL forms still?
10:39 < Tar-Minyatur> Just the forms you get from creating a web content off a structure.
10:40 < Tar-Minyatur> They have been using these to create "pseudo-flexible" articles by having fields to put image URLs into, CSS color codes and stuff...very messy.
10:40 < Tar-Minyatur> And in some cases (like this most recent template) there are even things like "either show an image with this URL here or load a web content".
10:41 < Tar-Minyatur> Because apparently it's too much to ask that they create a web content for just an image to show up. So they want to be able to put the URL directly into the input field. *sigh*
10:41 < Tar-Minyatur> Once bad practice has become common, you can't really get rid off it anymore. :-(
10:42 <@jhf> I see :/
10:43 < Tar-Minyatur> So. The template I just showed you works with IDs like "SOME-CONTENT" or "MORE-CONTENT".
10:43 < Tar-Minyatur> But not for the ID "TEST-CAMPAIGN-TEASER-1".
10:43 <@rotty3000> can I ask you to temporarily remove the macro definition? Velicoty might be caching the macro separately from the template
10:43 <@rotty3000> replace the macro with directly calling the same logic inline
10:45 < Tar-Minyatur> Didn't change anything.
10:45 < Tar-Minyatur> That doesn't seem to be the problem.
10:47 < Tar-Minyatur> Is there any way to activate some kind of logging or something?
10:47 < Tar-Minyatur> Because I find it very annoying not to get any information about what's happening there.
10:48 < Tar-Minyatur> Any way to get inside information from the journalContentUtil?
10:51 <@rotty3000> there is lots of logging options
10:52 <@rotty3000> let me find the details for you
10:53 < Tar-Minyatur> I saw that there is a bunch of setting in the CP concerning logging.
10:54 < Tar-Minyatur> So what's the way to go about it? Look into the source, find whether any logging is in place in the specific class and then set the flag for that logger to DEBUG or INFO?
10:54 <@rotty3000> turn on DEBUG logging for com.liferay.portal.templateparser.Transformer
10:54 <@rotty3000> it also has lots of logging subcategories
10:55 <@rotty3000> com.liferay.portal.templateparser.Transformer.OutputAfterListener  , .OutputBeforeListener, .ScriptAfterListener, .ScriptBeforeListener, .Tokens, .TransformBefore, .TransformAfter, .XmlAfterListener, .XmlBeforeListener
10:57 <@rotty3000> go to the server admin section of control panel to adjust/add log categories
10:58 < Tar-Minyatur> If I can't find them in there I just add them?
10:58 < Tar-Minyatur> Are they deactivated completeley if they don't show up in there?
11:01 <@rotty3000> just add them
11:01 <@rotty3000> even if they exist, adding them won't hurt
11:01 <@rotty3000> if they don't show up, it's because they are not defaulting to any level, which is effectively OFF
11:02 <@rotty3000> it's completely safe to use Add for logging categories even if they exists.. However, changes do NOT persist across restarts
11:03 <@rotty3000> they are in memory only
11:07 < Tar-Minyatur> Okay. Thanks for the information. That really might come in handy. I felt like flying blind for most of the template stuff.
11:07 < Tar-Minyatur> It's really annoying that Velocity simply does nothing when a method call didn't work.
11:10 < Tar-Minyatur> I'm just comparing the two articles that behave so differently.
11:10 < Tar-Minyatur> The one that works doesn't have a structure ID or a template ID assigned in the DB.
11:11 < Tar-Minyatur> Oh right. I used basic web content for that, nothing custom.
11:11 < Tar-Minyatur> Could that explain the problem?
11:12 < Tar-Minyatur> (If you are still around and not yet bored to death... ;))
11:12 <@rotty3000> still here
11:13 <@rotty3000> templates are not always a walk in the parc, but really you're doing some pretty advanced stuff once you reach the point of using the $journalContentUtil object
11:14 <@rotty3000> I'm wondering if perhaps you should disable the "Cacheable" setting on the template
11:14 <@rotty3000> to make sure that the "output" of that template wasn't actually "" at some point
11:14 < Tar-Minyatur> Done that on jhf's suggestion already.
11:14 <@rotty3000> and it got cached
11:14 <@rotty3000> ok
11:15 < Tar-Minyatur> And yes...it's stuff that I actually would like to avoid doing in a template, but what can you do... -.-
11:15 <@jhf> so it seems like Tar-Minyatur is trying to get the "rendered" content of the article - requiring either a reference to a template used to render it, OR the xmlContent thingy.
11:15 <@rotty3000> lastly you can actually use logging in your templates easily enough
11:15 <@rotty3000> want to see how?
11:15 < Tar-Minyatur> I have some logging in place in the template.
11:15 < Tar-Minyatur> Or do you mean something else?
11:15 <@rotty3000> ok so IS the "inner" template being invoked at all?
11:16 <@jhf> if you ask for the "content" of an article, (one based on a structure+template), you have to tell it which template to use to "render" the content, no?
11:16 < Tar-Minyatur> Oh. You mean THAT template. Right. Now I get it. I'll check.
11:16 <@rotty3000> jhf, if no templateId it will use it's "Default"
11:16 <@rotty3000> which is the first associated template of the structure
11:16 <@rotty3000> of the article
11:17 <@jhf> ok
11:18 < Tar-Minyatur> Looks like it's not being executed.
11:18 <@rotty3000> NOTE, the relationship of articles to templates goes through structures (even though the article has a templateId refrence) if that reference doesn't match the article's associated structure.. then it's actually broken
11:18 < Tar-Minyatur> No log output from the template associated with the content to be loaded.
11:18 <@rotty3000> ok
11:18 <@jhf> perhaps because of staging, the inner template can't be found? just throwing some more darts :)
11:19 < Tar-Minyatur> I was wondering about that at some point but forgot again, because it worked. I never realized that using the base content thingy will invoke a different behaviour.
11:24 <@rotty3000> is the content scoped in the normal way?
11:24 <@rotty3000> or is there special scoping involved?
11:25 < Tar-Minyatur> I didn't change anything on purpose.
11:25 <@rotty3000> ok, just checking
11:25 < Tar-Minyatur> Is there some way to check the scope?
11:25 < Tar-Minyatur> Can't see it in there.
11:26 < Tar-Minyatur> Looks very similar to the other article in the database. Except for the structure and template Ids.
11:26 <@rotty3000> well the $group_id you located should match the groupId of published articles, and the site
11:27 < Tar-Minyatur> Yeah, it does. The two GroupIds in the DB for each article are exactly those I can find in my log output.
11:27 <@rotty3000> ok, so, looking at articles in the DB having the same groupId as the live site.. what do their structure, and template ids look like in comparision to the values passed in the "teaser" references
11:28 <@rotty3000> also correct?
11:29 < Tar-Minyatur> There are two sets of IDs for the article which has them.
11:29 <@rotty3000> I guess you are not passing structure or template Ids...
11:29 < Tar-Minyatur> The live and staging ones I assume.
11:29 < Tar-Minyatur> No. I'm not.
11:29 < Tar-Minyatur> Only the content ID.
11:30 < josuebc> Hi there. I have a portlet and woud like to add a hook to implement a servlet filter. I have added the file liferay-hook.xml to my WEB-INF folder, this is the contents: http://pastebin.com/6ANY5tkW but I am getting an error while deploying. It only says it was unable to register the hook. Any ideas what might be wrong?
11:30 <@rotty3000> what do you get when you dump "$locale" ?
11:30 < Tar-Minyatur> en_US
11:30 < Tar-Minyatur> (Localization is not really being used. Everything is en_US.)
11:30 <@rotty3000> right
11:33 <@rotty3000> Tar-Minyatur: so these templates are working correctly in staging right?
11:34 < Tar-Minyatur> Not really, no. Loading the content doesn't work in staging or in live.
11:34 <@rotty3000> ok, ok...
11:34 < Tar-Minyatur> Rendering the stuff works though.
11:34 < Tar-Minyatur> When I use the preview feature.
11:34 < Tar-Minyatur> Or just have the asset publisher list all the stuff.
11:34 < Tar-Minyatur> (And click on "Show more.")
11:34 <@rotty3000> got it, individually , the articles work
11:35 < Tar-Minyatur> Yeah. Looks like it's really not rendering the article when the content is requested this way.
11:38 <@rotty3000> Tar-Minyatur: can you simplify without the macros like so :  https://gist.github.com/rotty3000/6270526
11:39 <@rotty3000> note , it's just showing one of the referenced articles
11:39 <@rotty3000> for test
11:39 <@rotty3000> oops, forgot the $xmlRequest
11:40 <@rotty3000> updated
11:53 < Tar-Minyatur> Done.
11:53 < Tar-Minyatur> No change.
11:53 < Tar-Minyatur> The log still reports that it could not be found.
11:53 < Tar-Minyatur> On Staging.
11:53 < Tar-Minyatur> I guess publishing it doesn't matter at this point.
11:57 < Tar-Minyatur> I'll have to head out in about 15 minutes, so don't waste too much time on this. I'm very grateful for your help.
15:12 < jardineworks> I think I might be losing my mind. I did a global search of the portal source for aui-w* in an effort to find the file where all the css aui-wXX styles were stored and it came up empty. Does anyone know which css file they reside in? I can't see to find them...
15:23 < smind> @jardineworks I see some references in ROOT/html/js/aui/aui-skin-base/css/aui-skin-base.css and also ROOT/html/css/portal/aui.css
15:58 < jardineworks> smind, Thank you! hah! now I feel old "Why aren't the css files exactly where they were in 1998?" :)
