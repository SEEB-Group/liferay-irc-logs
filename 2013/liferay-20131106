03:28 < rocknroll_:#liferay> hey all. I'm using jsonws to get article data
03:28 < rocknroll_:#liferay> how do i get the tags associated with the article?
04:35 < rocknroll_:#liferay> got it! need to use the resourcePrimaryKey to call com.liferay.portlet.asset.service.AssetTagServiceUtil#getTags
04:35 < rocknroll_:#liferay> excellent :)
05:25 < modd_:#liferay> I'm getting a "you don't have permissions to view this page after login" after login with a normal user in LR 6.2...but after a simple F5 it works
06:11 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Wow. Why did they change the interface for /c/view_journal_content from 6.1.0 to 6.1.2? :-(
06:19 < hufg:#liferay> hmh?
06:39 < GeoPlace-Tom:#liferay> So I finally got my portal up and running. Now for integration with a Server 2008 R2 AD, I've got a user imported, but the poor fellow can't log on
06:40 < modd_:#liferay> I found my issue: https://support.liferay.com/browse/LPS-41013 and heeey..it's a "won't fix" issue...
06:46 < GeoPlace-Tom:#liferay> So I have the user imported, and I'm trying to log in via screen name (which is mapped to samacccountname). I've upped the ldap module log levels to INFO but I can't see anything in liferay/logs or tomcat/logs when the user fails to log in
06:46 < GeoPlace-Tom:#liferay> Can anyone help me tease out what might be happeneing here?
06:48 < modd_:#liferay> default settings for login is by email
06:48 < hufg:#liferay> have you tried to use different login? ie. email
06:48 < GeoPlace-Tom:#liferay> Yes, I tried setting it to e-mail and it didn't take kindly to that, I will set it back now I have the log levels up and see what comes out of it
06:48 < hufg:#liferay> have you looked at the db whats there
06:49 < hufg:#liferay> is it (seemingly) valid etc?
06:50 < hufg:#liferay> what about these mythical 6 properties here http://www.opensourceforlife.com/2012/05/liferay-61-ldap-config-from-portal.html
06:52 < GeoPlace-Tom:#liferay> hufg: I'm looking through the db now, sadly my psql isn't quite as as good as it should be so it's taking a while
06:52 < hufg:#liferay> maybe use hsql and revert by copy the db
06:52 < hufg:#liferay> you can try the import much faster
06:53 < hufg:#liferay> it won't probably matter if you use psql or hsql
06:53 < hufg:#liferay> install liferay on hsql, copy db and use the copy to revert
06:54 < hufg:#liferay> just an idea :Z
06:54 < hufg:#liferay> although you can't access it when liferay is running so scratch that
06:54 < GeoPlace-Tom:#liferay> It's something I should learn, I'm getting better with each command :P
06:56 < hufg:#liferay> hehe yeah i'd check if the db user row made any sense at all
06:57 < GeoPlace-Tom:#liferay> Well it seems to have imported 'something' as the encrypted password_ field is different for each user
06:57 < hufg:#liferay> yeah and the rest of the fields seem good?
06:58 < hufg:#liferay> screenname? 8)
06:58 < GeoPlace-Tom:#liferay> It's imported the wrong e-mail address but I already tried the variety of ones it might be
06:58 < GeoPlace-Tom:#liferay> screen name matches ad logon
06:58 < hufg:#liferay> btw if screenname is empty and login by screenname is enable then the screenname is screenname@from.email
06:58 < GeoPlace-Tom:#liferay> password_ s are different for two different user (so presumably the pw is different)
06:58 < hufg:#liferay> blah-screenname@blah.com --> blah-screenname
07:00 < GeoPlace-Tom:#liferay> Yeah, the screen name I'm using matches the one in the user_ table
07:00 < GeoPlace-Tom:#liferay> What might the password hash be? I can has my known pw and see if it matches the entry
07:00 < GeoPlace-Tom:#liferay> *hash
07:08 < hufg:#liferay> login with omniadmin and change pw
07:08 < hufg:#liferay> that will give you an idea if the user is valid
07:08 < hufg:#liferay> like narrow down the problem ;(
07:09 < GeoPlace-Tom:#liferay> True, I'm not exporting so I won't mess up my AD acct :) good suggesting hufg
07:13 < GeoPlace-Tom:#liferay> Whee, in, so liferay login is working, if I restart the portal will it re-import the AD user and thus password I wonder?
07:15 < hufg:#liferay> no idea :d
07:15 < hufg:#liferay> try it
07:16 < hufg:#liferay> basically to work with liferay you just need to be willing to experiment and dig deep into the source
07:16 < GeoPlace-Tom:#liferay> So restart and see if the hashed pw changes
07:16 < GeoPlace-Tom:#liferay> Or cough up for EE ;)
07:16 < hufg:#liferay> hehe i'm not so sold on EE
07:16 < hufg:#liferay> ofc army of consultants and truck loads of money works
07:17 < hufg:#liferay> $ solves everything(in this profession)
07:17 < GeoPlace-Tom:#liferay> Well I got put on the sysad training which was pricey enough, guy did know his stuff to be fair
07:18 < hufg:#liferay> hmh?
07:18 < hufg:#liferay> liferay sysad training?
07:20 < GeoPlace-Tom:#liferay> Yeah, focuses on setup, tuning, clustering, nothing really on LR content (that's a different course)
07:20 < GeoPlace-Tom:#liferay> His biggest piece of advice was work with one eye on the portal.properties from the github
07:21 < hufg:#liferay> mm
07:21 < hufg:#liferay> do you know eclipse?
07:21 < hufg:#liferay> or have you used it
07:21 < hufg:#liferay> the best way is to get liferay src and import it to eclipse
07:22 < hufg:#liferay> ctrl+shift r/t will get you far
07:22 < hufg:#liferay> and grep
07:22 < hufg:#liferay> none of that github stuff
07:22 < hufg:#liferay> 8)
07:25 < GeoPlace-Tom:#liferay> Well github's built in viewer is nice, and I'm a sysad not a dev (though I apreciate most people do 'devops' now)
07:29 < hufg:#liferay> mm
08:14 < hufg:#liferay> lol srsly there is a problem with publishing and structure+template name locales
08:14 < hufg:#liferay> it's unable to validate a structure/template if name is not given in all languages
08:14 < hufg:#liferay> hilariously this only applies to scheduled publishing
08:25 < hufg:#liferay> how come scheduled publish and non scheduled differ you'd think only the start of execution is different
08:29 < hufg:#liferay> oh welll
08:48 < GeoPlace-Tom:#liferay> Ah, redone and have a user imported, the encrypted password is different again, so either it's auto-generating a pw for some reason OR the hash is different because there's some salt
08:49 < hufg:#liferay> imo there is salt
08:50 < GeoPlace-Tom:#liferay> In many ways I would hope so
08:50 < hufg:#liferay> how does it map the password to liferay?
08:50 < hufg:#liferay> btw there is a default salt property
08:51 < GeoPlace-Tom:#liferay> hufg: Good question, and one that the docs are struggling to answer for me, the fact I'm using Windows AD is muddying things (and 2008 R2), it's possible I need to change the mapping
09:11 < GeoPlace-Tom:#liferay> I have this sneaking suspicion that you can't extract the passwords from an AD, which means I'm going to need to build some sort of intermediary
09:13 < jardineworks:#liferay> GeoPlace-Tom, it's been a while since I did an LDAP integration with LR but as far as I recall, you don't extract the passwords. YOu can set it to use the AD password I think
09:13 < jardineworks:#liferay> I believe the actual authentication is done against the directory store and the user info is imported into LR just so that the ACLs for the portal can be used.
09:14 < jardineworks:#liferay> (going from memory so I could be "remembering" wrong :) )
09:16 < GeoPlace-Tom:#liferay> jardineworks: That would be the more sensible option. Either way it's not letting me in (but it does work if an omni-admin changes the pw)
09:17 < GeoPlace-Tom:#liferay> But at a guess changing the pw in the portal overrides whatever it's doing with the AD
09:17 < anteater_sa:#liferay> Hi, I am trying to exlucde a certain "document type" from my search results using the 6.1. search portlet. Is this something I can configure in the search portlet or in the document and media section?
09:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> GeoPlace-Tom, sorry -- I missed the thread. A few questions. Are you mapping the AD properties using the control panel or the portal-ext.properties file?
09:21 < GeoPlace-Tom:#liferay> jardineworks: Control panel, we're on 6.2CE connecting to a 2008R2 AD. I've set the filter so it only imports one AD user (me) using pretty much all the default settings
09:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> GeoPlace-Tom, and then the first time you logged in, it asked you to change your password right?
09:22 < GeoPlace-Tom:#liferay> jardineworks: No, it's refusing to accept my ad password
09:22 < jardineworks:#liferay> are you using the LDAP password policy?
09:23 < GeoPlace-Tom:#liferay> I've ticked the box 'Use LDAP Password policy' if that's what you mean
09:24 < jardineworks:#liferay> it is -- though to be honest I;m not sure if that means "use the ldap password" or force users when setting a password to use the rules configured in ldap.
09:25 < jardineworks:#liferay> and when you did your test ldap users that worked?
09:26 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> hufg: Sorry...had to leave earlier. The /c/view_journal_content was used in our project to dynamically load some menus and stuff via AJAX. The URLs were like /c/view_journal_content?cmd=preview&groupId=...&articleId=...&version=latest or something. Now in 6.1.2 I have to remove the cmd=preview or change it to "view" to make it work.
09:27 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Which is kind of annoying.
09:27 < GeoPlace-Tom:#liferay> jardineworks: I set the AD config in the LR porrtal, restarted, waited for my one user to appear, then logged out of the omniadmin I created when I set up the portal and tried to log on as my ad user
09:29 < jardineworks:#liferay> GeoPlace-Tom, just looking at the LDAPAuth.java class -- gimme a minute
09:30 < jardineworks:#liferay> it looks like it tries to do the lookup in LDAP based on the mapping for the screen name..
09:30 < jardineworks:#liferay> 			Properties userMappings = LDAPSettingsUtil.getUserMappings(
09:30 < jardineworks:#liferay> 				ldapServerId, companyId);
09:30 < jardineworks:#liferay> 			String userMappingsScreenName = GetterUtil.getString(
09:30 < jardineworks:#liferay> 				userMappings.getProperty("screenName")).toLowerCase();
09:31 < jardineworks:#liferay> and then it does a "search" with the filter you set..
09:31 < GeoPlace-Tom:#liferay> *checks* Screenname in users list matches the ad name
09:31 < jardineworks:#liferay> 		enu = ldapContext.search(baseDN, filter, searchControls);
09:31 < jardineworks:#liferay> ... subcalla few lines later: LDAPAuthResult ldapAuthResult = authenticate(
09:31 < jardineworks:#liferay> 					ldapContext, companyId, attributes, fullUserDN, password);
09:32 < jardineworks:#liferay> GeoPlace-Tom, this is a comment right at the beginning of that sub call
09:32 < jardineworks:#liferay> 		// Check passwords by either doing a comparison between the passwords or
09:32 < jardineworks:#liferay> 		// by binding to the LDAP server. If using LDAP password policies, bind
09:32 < jardineworks:#liferay> 		// auth method must be used in order to get the result control codes.
09:32 < jardineworks:#liferay> so you may need to check your password policies under the portal settings.
09:33 < jardineworks:#liferay> sorry -- under the portal section in the control panel I meant
09:34 < GeoPlace-Tom:#liferay> Sorry if I seem a bit short, but it's so frustrating when it feels like it's this || close to working :) I'm using bind (as is the default)
09:35 < jardineworks:#liferay> no worries -- we've all been there. Forgive my stupid questions/statements if you have already been asked :D
09:35 < jardineworks:#liferay> I'm also looking at a 6.1 admin as I don't have a 6.2 stood up yet.
09:35 < GeoPlace-Tom:#liferay> Yeah, I was trying to be clever and get ahead
09:36 < jardineworks:#liferay> ... and just going to ask, though I am sure you have checked/answered already, no stacktraces on startup or during login right?
09:36 < jardineworks:#liferay> ..  have you tried tunrning up the logging for LDAP yet?
09:37 < jardineworks:#liferay> by default it is set to ERROR which is not terribly useful in this situation :)
09:38 < jardineworks:#liferay> Control Panel > Server (section) > Server Administration > Log Levels (tab). Type LDAP in the search you sould get 2 results, set them to debug. Log out as omni and try to log in again.
09:38 < GeoPlace-Tom:#liferay> jardineworks: I put it to INFO and it didn't do much, I'll try a higher level, do you need to restart after chaning logging levels?
09:38 < jardineworks:#liferay> it might give you more new in the log
09:38 < jardineworks:#liferay> no restart if you do it via control panel
09:38 < jardineworks:#liferay> but it is only retained for that session.
09:38 < jardineworks:#liferay> debug should tell you more... I am seeing a few debug statements in the call hierarchy
09:39 < GeoPlace-Tom:#liferay> com.liferay.portal.security.ldap and com.liferay.portal.security.ldap.PortalLDAPUtil are now to DEBUG
09:40 < jardineworks:#liferay> are your password hashes the same? meaning is the portal configured to use the same one you use on LDAP?
09:40 < GeoPlace-Tom:#liferay> jardineworks: As it's AD rather than proper LDAP you can't view the hashes
09:42 < jardineworks:#liferay> GeoPlace-Tom, I know nothing about AD administration... I just assume that part of the configuration allowed you to set the encryption method.
09:43 < GeoPlace-Tom:#liferay> Hmm, am I seeing some statements in the logs when I try to log in, the only one that isn't just listing the jar file are these two
09:43 < GeoPlace-Tom:#liferay> 14:40:40,785 DEBUG [http-bio-8080-exec-5][LDAPSettingsUtil:52] Search filter before transformation (&(objectCategory=person)(sAMAccountName=@user_id@))
09:43 < GeoPlace-Tom:#liferay> 14:40:40,787 DEBUG [http-bio-8080-exec-5][LDAPSettingsUtil:67] Search filter after transformation (&(objectCategory=person)(sAMAccountName=0))
09:43 < GeoPlace-Tom:#liferay> Hang on...
09:44 < jardineworks:#liferay> asking about the password encryption algorithm because I can see that it applies the encryption to the password stored in the portal and then compares it to AD. So if you use DES on AD and AES is configured in Liferay (just picking random ones here) then of course they would not match
09:44 < GeoPlace-Tom:#liferay> In the field for auth (&(objectCategory=person)(sAMAccountName=@user_id@)) should be @screen_name@ instead :D
09:44 < GeoPlace-Tom:#liferay> I now have the ToS up
09:45 < jardineworks:#liferay> so you are in?
09:45 < jardineworks:#liferay> with your account?
09:45 < GeoPlace-Tom:#liferay> Yup
09:45 < jardineworks:#liferay> EHF
09:45 < jardineworks:#liferay> (electronic high five)
09:46 < GeoPlace-Tom:#liferay> Thanks for working through this with me, sometimes the simple act of typing stuff out helps you see things
09:46 < GeoPlace-Tom:#liferay> ^5
09:47 < jardineworks:#liferay> the term is rubber ducking :)
09:47 < jardineworks:#liferay> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging
09:48 < GeoPlace-Tom:#liferay> Nice, not come across that before
10:05 < hufg:#liferay> we had here a stranglable(?) chicken
10:05 < hufg:#liferay> (toy chicken)
10:05 < hufg:#liferay> now that would have been an awesome rubber duck
10:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> hufg, I have paper monsters that I talk too hahaha
10:06 < hufg:#liferay> now this line here and this, goddamn motherfcucker *strangle strangle strangle* this line blaa blaa
10:06 < hufg:#liferay> it would actually make some noises and flail it's limbs, now that would be somewhat disturbing if someone kept strangling a chicken like that in the office :D
10:07 < hufg:#liferay> jardineworks: hehe nice
10:09 < GeoPlace-Tom:#liferay> A friend used to have a plushie The Cheat from Homestar Runner I can see that working too (if you tapped it, it made Cheat noises)
10:15 < jardineworks:#liferay> makes me think of the staples "easy" button.
10:15 < jardineworks:#liferay> though I don't think any programmer has ever hit it :)
10:16 < hufg:#liferay> i'd like a configurable big red button which would input a command into the terminal
10:16 < jardineworks:#liferay> I think it is reserved for Business Stakeholders who only see the black box and have no idea the amount of hair loss that was required to make it so that they could push the button.
10:16 < jardineworks:#liferay> hufg, sounds like a good Arduino project :)
10:16 < GeoPlace-Tom:#liferay> hufg: Arduino?
10:16 < hufg:#liferay> whats that
10:16 < hufg:#liferay> :D
10:16 < GeoPlace-Tom:#liferay> Great minds, I want a Big Red Button that activates our DR
10:17 < hufg:#liferay> it would be mvn clean package for me
10:17 < hufg:#liferay> with come cp or scp
10:17 < hufg:#liferay> ok i'll read up on arduino
10:18 < hufg:#liferay> but it seriously needs to be a big red button that's like the minimum requirement for this
10:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> hufg, that would be an easy arduino project :)
10:21 < GeoPlace-Tom:#liferay> Very simply an Arduino is a programmable microcontroller, it can also work like a USB peripheral
10:21 < hufg:#liferay> ok
10:50 < darkos:#liferay> hello @rotty3000
10:51 < darkos:#liferay> I appear to be having an issue with dynamic data lists.  anyone able to help?
11:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> has anyone encountered that stupid raster image exception? the scanline 32 one?
11:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> hufg, if you are making a fancy site like me maybe you have?
11:10 < hufg:#liferay> yes yes
11:10 < hufg:#liferay> newest jdk
11:10 < hufg:#liferay> is to blame
11:10 < hufg:#liferay> anything after 1.7.0u21 will produce it
11:11 < hufg:#liferay> it's a gift!
11:12 < hufg:#liferay> not 100% but the problem may be related to a png in parent theme
11:12 < hufg:#liferay> 100% sure
11:12 < hufg:#liferay> maybe if you fix the png it works
11:17 < jardineworks:#liferay> yeah I found a post by jhf
11:17 < jardineworks:#liferay> so removing the calendar.png files fixed it for you as wll?
11:18 < jardineworks:#liferay> my client is saying that they will not downgrade because of security... but all the security exploits are for applets and web start apps -- not applicable to server side web apps.
11:24 < jardineworks:#liferay> hufg, how do you tell which PNGs are causing the problems?
11:25 < floppyears:#liferay> I have been dealing with a weird issue in Liferay and one of my portlets. It is hard to reproduce, but I'm running into this issue in production. The Shared portlet session is invalidated
11:25 < floppyears:#liferay> for all users
11:26 < floppyears:#liferay> Meaning user x is doing something and the session is invalidated for all other users. The only thing that fixes the issue is to re-deploy the portlet or restart liferay.
11:26 < floppyears:#liferay> This is the error message: portal-web.docroot.html.portal.render_portlet.jsp java.lang.IllegalStateException: getAttribute: Session already invalidated at org.apache.catalina.session.StandardSession.getAttribute(StandardSession.java:1021) at org.apache.catalina.session.StandardSessionFacade.getAttribute(StandardSessionFacade.java:110) at com.liferay.util.servlet.SharedSessionWrapper.getAttribute(SharedSessionWrapper.java:68)
11:27 < floppyears:#liferay> Do you guys have any suggestions on how to track this down or fix it? The only way, I have been able to replicate this stack trace via code is by PortalUtil.getHttpServletRequest(request).getSession(true).invalidate()
11:27 < floppyears:#liferay> then any future attemtps to use the request.getPortletSession() from within the portlet fail. Any way to recover from an invalidated shared session? I have been hitting my head against the wall for several days with this issue :(
11:30 < jardineworks:#liferay> hufg, you are on 6.1.2 right?
13:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey guys
13:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> does the 6.1.2 GA3 release use the same 6.1. plugins?
13:54 < apucay:#liferay> well there is a tag in github https://github.com/liferay/liferay-plugins/tree/6.1.2-ga3
13:58 < apucay:#liferay> but i think as long as the liferay-versions property in liferay-plugin-package.properties has a + at the end, it'll work with higher minor versions
14:06 < jardineworks:#liferay> apucay, I actually found the release annoucement from jhf.. and someone asked in the comments. Apparently 6.1.0, 6.1.1 and 6.1.2 all work with the same sdk
14:06 < jardineworks:#liferay> just poor naming.

15:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> I think its time to learn CQ5
15:23 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Funny.
15:24 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> That was what I was hired for.
15:24 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> And now I'm fixing a broken Liferay setup...
15:29 < jardineworks:#liferay> wtf
15:29 < jardineworks:#liferay> I am really starting to lose faith in this platform
15:30 < jardineworks:#liferay> all the issues that plague me on a daily basis are stupid shit
15:30 < jardineworks:#liferay> I mean, real gotchas? sure. but this?!
15:30 < jardineworks:#liferay> to reduce the plugin sdk from 30mb to 200k?
15:30 < jardineworks:#liferay> who gives a shit about that?
15:31 < jardineworks:#liferay> you coul dmake it 3 gig for all I care... IF IT WORKS.
15:32 < jardineworks:#liferay> and the best part with this one? it says its fixed in 6.2. I am looking at the 6.2 configs and they look identical to what I have. The jar is there... it is referenced in the ivy-settings...
15:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik, if you are around and have an idea, I would appreciate the guidance.
15:48 < topolik:#liferay> jardineworks: hi, what's up?
15:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik, apologies in advance, really frustrated right now. 6.1.1ce has an issue where you get some silly scnaline error when you deploy your own theme.
15:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik, I tried to erase the png files or whatever .. no dice.
15:52 < jardineworks:#liferay> client won't down grade to jdk 1.6 (despite the fact that there is no need or security risk for them)
15:52 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik, so last resort, I am upgrading to 6.1.2. I have the protal up and running. Downloaded the sdk that comes with that fileset and now I get this for all my ant target calls ---

16:00 < jardineworks:#liferay> I do... both of those
16:00 < jardineworks:#liferay> i am using the latest jdk, but I tried downgrading to 1.6_u33 and it didn't help
16:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> didn't think it would but it was an easy test to be sure
16:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik, I am guessing you don't have this issue on your end?
16:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> have you seen it before?
16:05 < topolik:#liferay> I didn't try 6.1.2
16:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik, and you never had the scanline issue on 6.1.1?
16:06 < topolik:#liferay> nope
16:06 < topolik:#liferay> I didn't use Java 7 together with Liferay 6.1.
16:06 < topolik:#liferay> it's a problem of Java or Liferay?
16:08 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik, the scanline issue? a combination. Any jsdk 7 with an update higher than 15. They changed something in how the png files are handled or some nonsense.
16:08 < topolik:#liferay> uhm
16:09 < topolik:#liferay> so some existing PNG files don't work?
16:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> because it was a change to the core sdk it affected the api for Liferay (something that happens during hot deployment of themes)
16:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> there was some supposed fix that if you removed all references to it fixed the issue but it didn't help me
16:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> so upgrade to 6.1.2 GA3.
16:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> and now I can't deploy ANY plugins.
16:10 < topolik:#liferay> what do you call?
16:10 < topolik:#liferay> ant deploy?
16:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> yep
16:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> for my theme
16:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> I am starting with it of course to make sure that it will push out properly
16:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> I was going to do the layouts, hooks, etc. after
16:12 < topolik:#liferay> when I compare 6.1.2 SDK with 6.2 SDK and IVY configuration, there are 2 ivy-settings files
16:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik, is there somewhere else that I can copy those files ... like a glbal space or something? I don't even care if it is a hack anymore.
16:13 < jardineworks:#liferay> right
16:13 < jardineworks:#liferay> ivy.xml
16:13 < jardineworks:#liferay> and ivy-settings.xml
16:13 < topolik:#liferay> I mean
16:13 < topolik:#liferay> in 6.1.2 there is only ivy-settings.xml
16:13 < jardineworks:#liferay> and build-common.ivy.xml that references them
16:13 < topolik:#liferay> which also contains the <pgp tag
16:13 < topolik:#liferay> which is IMHO responsible for the exception
16:13 < topolik:#liferay> but looking at build-common-ivy.xml, it seems that this is important for publishing
16:14 < topolik:#liferay> https://github.com/liferay/liferay-plugins/blob/master/build-common-ivy.xml#L93
16:14 < topolik:#liferay> https://github.com/liferay/liferay-plugins/blob/master/build.properties#L167
16:14 < jardineworks:#liferay> the sdk for 6.1.2 has a name of 6.1.1 ... that's the one I downloaded (though it was in the same directory as the 6.1.2 tomcat bundle). Mine has ivy.xmla nd ivy-settings.xml
16:15 < topolik:#liferay> right, in master you can see that the default ivy-settings.xml file doesn't contain the PGP
16:15 < topolik:#liferay> https://github.com/liferay/liferay-plugins/blob/master/ivy-settings.xml
16:15 < jardineworks:#liferay> i don't have a ivy-settings-publisher.xml
16:15 < topolik:#liferay> right
16:15 < topolik:#liferay> see the URLs
16:16 < topolik:#liferay> it's master
16:16 < topolik:#liferay> compare the ivy-settings.xml from master with your ivy-settings.xml: https://github.com/liferay/liferay-plugins/blob/6.1.2-ga3/ivy-settings.xml
16:16 < jardineworks:#liferay> I think I tried copyign the master one and using it instead and I got the same error. But let me try that again.
16:17 < jardineworks:#liferay> yeah -- the url stuff too
16:17 < topolik:#liferay> https://issues.liferay.com/browse/LPS-40693
16:17 < topolik:#liferay> so - my question
16:17 < topolik:#liferay> what happen when you remove this block from you file? https://github.com/liferay/liferay-plugins/blob/6.1.2-ga3/ivy-settings.xml#L35,L37
16:18 < jardineworks:#liferay> ... trying that now...
16:19 < jardineworks:#liferay> so far...
16:19 < jardineworks:#liferay> [ivy:resolve] :: Apache Ivy 2.3.0 - 20130110142753 :: http://ant.apache.org/ivy/ ::
16:19 < jardineworks:#liferay> [ivy:resolve] :: loading settings :: file = /home/aj/projects/havas/sprouts/liferay/6.1.2ce/sdk/ivy-settings.xml
16:19 < jardineworks:#liferay> is ivy somethign that has just been added?
16:19 < jardineworks:#liferay> build successful
16:20 < topolik:#liferay> seems it was added in 6.1.2
16:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> so why was it failing with that block?
16:20 < topolik:#liferay> I don't know
16:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> <pgp keyId="${pgp.keyname}" name="${pgp.generator}" password="${pgp.passphrase}" />
16:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> I don't know if those variables are actually defined anywhere
16:21 < topolik:#liferay> I think they are important for publishing
16:22 < topolik:#liferay> for publishing the SDK into repositories
16:22 < topolik:#liferay> you won't do ever do this
16:22 < jardineworks:#liferay> i see
16:22 < jardineworks:#liferay> the other issue I am facing is when I try to build from the ant window in eclipse I am getting that ecj error
16:23 < jardineworks:#liferay> it says to re-run as it has installed it or soemthing... but no matter how many times I run, I always get the same message
16:23 < topolik:#liferay> uhm
16:23 < topolik:#liferay> I don't use ant from eclipse
16:24 < topolik:#liferay> did you try to restart eclipse?
16:27 < topolik:#liferay> oh, so you run the ant from eclipse, that's https://issues.liferay.com/browse/LPS-40693 :D
16:27 < jardineworks:#liferay> I think it was failing to copy the lib (permissions) I just copied it by hand and am trying a restart
16:27 < topolik:#liferay> btw. do you have a stacktrace for that PNG problem?
16:28 < jardineworks:#liferay> not anymore but let me see if I can find the link to the forum post
16:29 < jardineworks:#liferay> running ant from eclipse still gives me the ecj problem
16:30 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik, https://www.liferay.com/community/forums/-/message_boards/message/26368932
16:34 < jardineworks:#liferay> \o/
16:34 < jardineworks:#liferay> ecj solved.
16:34 < jardineworks:#liferay> maybe now I can do some of my actual project work!
16:35 < jardineworks:#liferay> thanks topolik
16:39 < topolik:#liferay> hehe, good to hear
16:39 < topolik:#liferay> y/w
16:39 < topolik:#liferay> btw. for the PNG you can see https://issues.liferay.com/browse/LPS-37920
16:41 < topolik:#liferay> https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/commit/137b55dd1957f0dda1a4116ce8574ce549b8c2f4#diff-ea6a0b220aa2d281bbcedca910471af3R242
16:43 < topolik:#liferay> I believe the problem is: imageWorker.forceIndexColorModelForGIF()
16:44 < topolik:#liferay> so now, w/o converting to indexed pallete, it's OK to use only ImageIO.write(renderedImage, "gif", spriteFile);
16:44 < topolik:#liferay> this is how I understand the fix
16:45 < topolik:#liferay> hmm, Oracle changed it because of this: https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-0809
16:46 < topolik:#liferay> interesting for me ^^ :)
16:50 < jardineworks:#liferay> over my head
16:50 < jardineworks:#liferay> :)
16:50 < jardineworks:#liferay> i'm just happy my theme deployed with jdk7u45
18:56 < floppyears:#liferay> Does anybody have any ideas as to what could possibly invalidate a portlet session for all users within liferay?
20:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> floppyears, you still there?
23:12 < floppyears:#liferay> jardineworks: yes
23:12 < floppyears:#liferay> jardineworks: I use screen to keep my session open. If you have any ideas or questions regarding my problem feel free to post them and I will get back to them next time I see them
23:19 < jardineworks:#liferay> I was hoping to have a conversation about what you are doing to better understand first
23:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> i'm pretty beat though so I am about to sign off. I'll keep an eye out for you tomorrow
23:34 < floppyears:#liferay> jardineworks: ok, thanks. at around what time tomorrow should I ping you?
