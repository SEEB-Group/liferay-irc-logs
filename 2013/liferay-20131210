02:11 < Axxell:#liferay> hi again, guys, still having trouble with themes for liferay 6.2, can anyone help?
03:21 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I wish I could use 6.2...
03:54 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Why is there no way to get from a page in "Site Pages" to the actual site? Oo
04:59 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> What the...!?
05:00 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> When I try to publish some pages in 6.1.2 I don't get a confirmation that the publishing succeeded...instead Liferay loads the "Site Pages" portlet inside of the publishing dialog. Oo
05:12 < Axxell:#liferay> hmm anyone know where i would find how aui:navbar is used?
06:06 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I honestly hate the publishing feature. -.-
06:48 < Axxell:#liferay> anyone?
07:31 < anteater_sa:#liferay> is there an easy way to get assets of a certain type using the AssetEntryQuery class?
08:29 < hufg:#liferay> anyone ever experienced amd vs intel situation with liferay? 8)
08:30 < hufg:#liferay> cpu hehe
09:24 < jardineworks:#liferay> good morning guys
09:24 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, you still around this morning?
09:26 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Hi jardineworks.
09:26 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I'm sort of here...yes.
09:27 < jardineworks:#liferay> qq for you. What OS are you guys using for your deployment?
09:30 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> All our boxes are running ubuntu server, I think.
09:30 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> (Amazon EC2 images.)
09:33 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, but you don't know which OS your images are running on?
09:33 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Linux. Ubuntu Server.
09:40 < hufg:#liferay> yoyo
09:46 < apucay:#liferay> yoyo
09:50 < jardineworks:#liferay> hufg, apucay -- either or you using a CentOS or one of the other derivatives of RH?
09:51 < hufg:#liferay> rhel
09:51 < hufg:#liferay> 5 and some minor version
09:53 < hufg:#liferay> so yes 8)
09:57 < jardineworks:#liferay> hmmm
09:57 < jardineworks:#liferay> hufg, any issue doing the setup? or was that someone elses problem :)
09:59 < hufg:#liferay> some
09:59 < hufg:#liferay> related to dynamiccssfilter and dynamic sass parsing which uses some zz pzz libraries
10:00 < hufg:#liferay> this involved mounting tmp as exec mount
10:00 < hufg:#liferay> the libs are not loaded without exec
10:00 < hufg:#liferay> it actually may be some hardening which had tmp as noexec
10:00 < hufg:#liferay> and you wont see in default centos
10:01 < hufg:#liferay> anyways mount /tmp as exec and you are good
10:02 < hufg:#liferay> it's easy to verify, there will be an error msg with any theme when you log in, the admin ui css will be broken and you can see sass in css files
10:04 < hufg:#liferay> cat /proc/mounts|grep /tmp
10:08 < jardineworks:#liferay> hufg, interesting. I'll pass that along. Our partner is saying that it can't be run on centOS .. I assumed that it was security related since centOS (I have no experience with it) is supposed to be enterprise grade right? ...
10:08 < jardineworks:#liferay> hufg, I think we have the dynsmic css filter disaabled though. So shouldn't that bypass the issue?
10:09 < hufg:#liferay> yes
10:10 < hufg:#liferay> uh uh it will run perfectly fine on centos
10:11 < hufg:#liferay> centos is the free version of rhel
10:12 < hufg:#liferay> yeah you won't be having upgrades or not so many upgrades etc.
10:12 < hufg:#liferay> i think rhel is cheap?
10:12 < hufg:#liferay> get rhel hehe
10:13 < hufg:#liferay> jardineworks: btw how are you building your theme with dynamiccssfilter disabled?
10:13 < hufg:#liferay> to get precompiled sass
10:14 < hufg:#liferay> i bet you have dynamiccssfilter on, it's a pain in the ass if it's off
10:16 < jardineworks:#liferay> lemme double check
10:16 < jardineworks:#liferay> I must be confusing it with soemthing else
10:17 < jardineworks:#liferay> you're right -- I had it turned off once a LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONG time ago and everything was messed up :)
10:17 < jardineworks:#liferay> ok -- looks like I need to POC centOS then
10:17 < jardineworks:#liferay> thanks haba713
10:17 < jardineworks:#liferay> errr
10:17 < jardineworks:#liferay> hufg,
10:17 < jardineworks:#liferay> :)
10:18 < hufg:#liferay> np np
13:38 < bradley__:#liferay> how is everyone enjoying Liferay 6.2?
13:38 < bradley__:#liferay> are there very many people using liferay 6.1.2 GA3 CE?
14:03 < jardineworks:#liferay> bradley__, We're using it right now
14:03 < jardineworks:#liferay> go live in about a month I think
14:03 < bradley__:#liferay> 6.2 or 6.1.2 GA3
14:04 < bradley__:#liferay> I plan to make a theme that has drop down menu down the road
14:04 < bradley__:#liferay> but trying to figure out if I should make it for 6.2 or 6.1.20 GA3
14:04 < bradley__:#liferay> http://octothemes.com/downloads/architekt-theme/
14:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> we're using 6.1.2
14:21 < bradley__:#liferay> ok
14:21 < bradley__:#liferay> what theme features do you think people are interested in?
14:28 < jardineworks:#liferay> bradley__, no idea man - lol ... all the sites I have worked on have been one offs so not its difficult to answer a question like that :)
14:29 < bradley__:#liferay> ok
14:29 < bradley__:#liferay> I know responsive is important and people are always asking about navigation drop down menus
14:29 < bradley__:#liferay> I no longer work for Liferay
14:29 < bradley__:#liferay> so that's why I'm selling my own themes
14:48 < jardineworks:#liferay> bradley__, responsive for sure would probably be most peoples #1 requirement.
