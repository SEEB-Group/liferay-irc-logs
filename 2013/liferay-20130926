04:53 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Oh wow. That automated verification of all data after auto upgrading takes ages if your DL content is located in a S3 bucket.
05:30 < rocknroll_:#liferay> I'm trying to add tags to journalarticles just by adding them to database table 'assetentries_assettags' directly
05:31 < rocknroll_:#liferay> but tags are not showing up in the ui
05:31 < rocknroll_:#liferay> any ideas..
05:36 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Don't mess around in the database by hand.
05:36 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> IN 99.9% of all cases this will fail.
05:37 < rocknroll_:#liferay> I have a huge load of tags to add to existing articles.
05:37 < rocknroll_:#liferay> i know its a recipe for disaster usually :P
05:38 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Use the Liferay API to perform bulk jobs like that.
05:38 < rocknroll_:#liferay> i have a csv with articleid's and tags
05:38 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Never ever touch the DB.
05:40 < rocknroll_:#liferay> yeah.. guess i'll go with
05:40 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I guess you can check if you could do it by invoking webservice calls via some kind of script.
05:40 < rocknroll_:#liferay> /journalarticle/update-article
05:40 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> If you don't want do build a hook for it.
05:40 < rocknroll_:#liferay> I originally slammed all my articles in via jsonws
05:40 < rocknroll_:#liferay> but forgot some tags :P
05:42 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Shame on you. ;)
05:42 < rocknroll_:#liferay> yeah :D
06:30 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> how can I share the database to another application which is not using the service builder?
06:35 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I would strongly advise against doing that.
06:35 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Check if you can use the webservices instead.
06:44 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> I did strongly advised to use webservice, but they don't want to work like that. There is a proprietary framework created over here which by god's grace is from 80's and doesn't work with any other technologies than itself. I'm stuck in this shit
06:55 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, thank you for the reply. although i gave them the alternatives, they are too stubborn to do what you said saying webservices are hard to create.
07:07 < rocknroll_:#liferay> hmm
07:18 < rocknroll_:#liferay> ok, how do i grab the existing tags for an article via jsonws? if I updatearticle,  all the existing tags will be replaced
07:19 < rocknroll_:#liferay> i'm starting to think it will be easier to just do this via the ui :>
07:19 < rocknroll_:#liferay> (and faster..)
07:23 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> avinashrbhat: No need to create them. They are already there!
07:26 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, let me correct you, the application that shares the data with liferay is something created a while ago. They used an internal framework that was developed a while ago. This framework doesn't gives you a way to create webservices out of the box. that's why i said "webservices are hard to create".
07:28 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> But you don't need to create webservices.
07:28 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> You need to access the webservices Liferay offers.
07:28 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Liferay comes by default with a webservice for pretty much anything.
07:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> avinashrbhat, Tar-Minyatur what about configuring your service builder to write to an external database (not liferays) and then having both systems connect to it.
07:49 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> jardineworks, right now i'm thinking of that alternative. but it will create some problems IMO coz of the persistence offered in the servicebuilder
07:58 < jardineworks:#liferay> servicebuilder can persist to external databases
07:58 < jardineworks:#liferay> its just that by default it uses Liferays
08:36 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> jardineworks, so if while running, someone changes the external database, liferay persistance will also change?
08:37 < hufg:#liferay> whats aap
08:38 < hufg:#liferay> i've spent some 3 hours extending my bash 3 associative array implementation only to conclude should have hard coded the problem away in the first place
08:38 < hufg:#liferay> some 5min vs 3h
08:40 < hufg:#liferay> dayym
08:48 < rocknroll_:#liferay> i know how you feel :P
08:48 < rocknroll_:#liferay> all in a days work..
09:20 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> jardineworks: Do you know if it's possible to deactivate one part of the verification process that is started during Liferay's database update mechanism?
09:48 < hufg:#liferay> any ideas how to change public page virtualhost with sql only
09:48 < hufg:#liferay> i assumed it was from virtualhost table
09:49 < hufg:#liferay> it's already set
09:53 < hufg:#liferay> the idea was to just update the existing value, ie. update virtualhost set hostname='blabla' where virtualhostid=xxx
09:57 < hufg:#liferay> maybe i just need to boot the domain to circumvent caches
11:50 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Wow. So many topics on my to do list and I don't want to start on a single one of them. ;)
11:52 < pnutbutr:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur: have you tried starting them all at once?
11:52 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> *lol* Great idea.
11:52 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> In all that chaos nobody will notice me leaving quietly ;D
11:52 < pnutbutr:#liferay> rapidly switching context is a great way to maximize productivity.
11:53 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Only if the frequency matches the timeout interval of the short term memory. ;)
11:53 < pnutbutr:#liferay> good call, with all the smoke from the over taxed CPU you can slip out the back door
12:06 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> rotty3000: If you are around and have a minute...the update process of Liferay 6.1.2 causes me problems when migrating from 6.1.0. The VerifyDocumentLibrary process gets stuck on verfying the mime types of file versions. I guess it's because it has to connect to S3 for every one of them.
12:06 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Is there any chance for me to fix this or, if there isn't, can I somehow deactivate this particular process?
12:50 < daqSam:#liferay> Hi all, does anyone have a link documenting how to do structure inheritance in Liferay? tks
13:18 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> What part of Liferay are you talking about?
13:25 < daqSam:#liferay> Liferay webcontent structures
13:27 < daqSam:#liferay> I couldn't find any extensive docs on how setting a structure's parent structure would affect/use the child structure...
13:27 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Good question. Have you tried it?
13:27 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I would expect that the parent's fields would just appear as well as the child's when you create a content with the child structure.
13:28 < daqSam:#liferay> hmm I see...
13:29 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I can't try it right now.
13:29 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> No Liferay within my reach.
13:29 < daqSam:#liferay> Looking at it from the parent's standpoint, I hoped there would be a way to have some sort of selection box allowing me to use one of many child structures
13:30 < daqSam:#liferay> But yeah.. I'll try putting together some simple structures and assigning them a parent structure to see what happens
13:30 < daqSam:#liferay> Thanks!
13:31 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Not exactly sure, but I guess it should be possible to create a hook that will create some kind of "select a child" option to the cp.
13:32 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Somebody in here was messing around with structures lately...maybe you'll be in luck and he'll turn up. Can't remember the name right now though.
13:32 < daqSam:#liferay> interesting... I haven't had any experience with hooks apart from reading a LR training book once
13:33 < daqSam:#liferay> np
13:33 < daqSam:#liferay> tks again!
13:33 < aj_:#liferay> daqSam, there is nothing to do boss... just set it as the parent and when youcreate a new item the parent fields appear
13:34 < daqSam:#liferay> yeah... I thought it had another purpose
13:35 < daqSam:#liferay> I'd like to be able to select between different 'child-structures' from within a webcontent form
13:35 < aj_:#liferay> nope.. it basically saves you defining the same attributes over and over again
13:36 < daqSam:#liferay> so you could create a more generic structure and then add specific fields to it via it's children structures, is it?
13:38 < daqSam:#liferay> btw, when defining the structure schema, is there any dummy element/tag in order to make the whole set repeatable? Currently I'm using a text field to do it...
13:39 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I tend to use a checkbox and use the value of the checkbox to signal if to show the entire thing.
13:40 < daqSam:#liferay> cool! when you use it, does it disables its child fields if it is unchecked?
13:40 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> You can try using a break...it will act like a headline. But I remember there being some issue with that...and I'm not even sure if it can be repeatable.
13:40 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Nah, it doesn't.
13:40 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Again...I guess you could build that with a hook.
13:41 < daqSam:#liferay> that would be a nice-to-have addition to the editor
13:41 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Not really.
13:42 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> It's way too specific.
13:42 < daqSam:#liferay> I'll try going the hook route
13:42 < daqSam:#liferay> tks for that
13:43 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Building hooks is not really difficult. Finding the right places to modify is not always easy. ;)
13:43 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> But it's perfectly possible and many people in here have done their fair share of hooks already.
13:44 < daqSam:#liferay> Do you think it might be interesting to share it here whenever I get something done?
13:44 < daqSam:#liferay> you know, to extend a hand
13:45 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Can't hurt. Maybe someone else can find a use for it.
13:45 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> And sharing is always appreciated.
13:45 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Maybe it will make a nice example for how to go about modifying the CP.
16:59 < csllama:#liferay> Liferay newbie here, would anyone have a second for likely a silly question regarding the delivered RSS portlet (5.2.X)?
19:16 < Naenyn:#liferay> rotty3000: does the portlet id for an instanceable portlet ever change once the portlet has been placed on a specific site/page? Say for instance we have the document and media portlet on a page and have an id like 118_INSTANCE_A9JHqsoB56e9 .. will that id ever change for that instance of the portlet?
