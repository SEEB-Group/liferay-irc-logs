09:38 < modd_:#liferay> woho!
09:40 < modd_:#liferay> I'll use it for the presentation at my former university ;)
10:45 < dblessing:#liferay> the new template editor is amazing. autocomplete and the sidebar with the structure vars is incredible
11:02 < jardineworks:#liferay> does anyone know if there is a startup event handler for the PORTAL...
11:02 < jardineworks:#liferay> I don't want to hook a particular plugin, I want a handler to run when the portal is starting
11:07 < jardineworks:#liferay> nm
11:07 < jardineworks:#liferay> looks like what I am doing is correct.
17:55 < dblessing:#liferay> i'm getting some weird "Uncaught RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded" errors with Alloy when I try to edit things like Templates. This is only in Display portlets (Web Content Display - edit template or Data List Display - edit display template)  Has anyone else run across this?
18:02 < dblessing:#liferay> hmm seems that it's only with a custom theme. will do more digging
