03:50 < grapsus__:#liferay> hi there
03:52 < grapsus__:#liferay> do you know if LIFERAY SECURITY ALERT: LPE-9285
03:52 < grapsus__:#liferay> affect the CE version ?
03:53 < grapsus__:#liferay> "A security vulnerability exists that allows a user to access any file in the application server's deployment path (e.g., the webapp folder on Tomcat). This issue affects any portlet that extends com.liferay.util.bridges.scripting.ScriptingPortlet, but does not affect any out-of-the-box portlet.
07:00 < hufg:#liferay> i wonder how reverse proxying the virtualhost/journaltransformer functionality works
07:00 < hufg:#liferay> probably some performance penalty but how much

09:42 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey guys -- do the configuration page settings apply to a portlet instance? or does it apply to all portlets of a given "type"?
09:43 < jardineworks:#liferay> I know that he edit mode of a portlet is intended to allow a user to customize how they see a portlet but I have seen this mod3e hijacked to perform what appears to be portlet instance configuration. Shouldn't any portlet instance configuration be done using CONFIG mode?
10:54 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Hey guys. Do you know if it is possible to prevent users from seeing particular portlets in the portlet list (when editing a page) only with permissions?
11:30 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, you mean adding portlets to a page?
11:30 < jardineworks:#liferay> the Add Component thingee?
11:30 < jardineworks:#liferay> rotty3000, are you around for a follow up struts action override question?
11:31 <@rotty3000:#liferay> sure, but not lots of time this week :(
11:32 < jardineworks:#liferay> I'm sure that this one will take less than a minute.
11:33 < jardineworks:#liferay> Reminder. I have an OAuth hook that will perform the social sign in, and then forwards the user (if they have no LR account) to a custom create_account.jsp which is deployed via a separate hook.
11:33 < jardineworks:#liferay> The jsp in my create_account hook shows up correctly (my custom version) and when I submit it is not routing the action to me custom XXXCreateAccountAction class
11:34 < jardineworks:#liferay> I don't have birthday required as a field and the exception I am getting in the log is a BirthdayContactException which I think means that it is routing the action to the original CreateAccountAction provided by LR.
11:35 < jardineworks:#liferay> remember last week when you were helping me you explained BaseStrutAction vs. BasePortletStrustsAction ... so my liferay-hook.xml has
11:35 < jardineworks:#liferay>     <struts-action>
11:35 < jardineworks:#liferay>         <struts-action-path>/portal/login/create_account</struts-action-path>
11:35 < jardineworks:#liferay>         <struts-action-impl>com.mercatus.liferay.auth.login.action.XXXCreateAccountAction</struts-action-impl>
11:35 < jardineworks:#liferay>     </struts-action>	
11:36 < jardineworks:#liferay> and my XXXCreateAccountAction is extending BaseStrutsPortletAction... though I beleive I have also tried with BaseStrustsAction... and in both cases I am not getting routed to my custom class.
11:36 < jardineworks:#liferay> just the birthday exception.
11:40 < jardineworks:#liferay> the struts config in the portal specified /login/create_account, so I assume that means that the class should extend the BaseStrutsPortletAction
11:40 < jardineworks:#liferay> but I'm a little lost.
11:41 <@rotty3000:#liferay> jardineworks: hmm
11:41 <@rotty3000:#liferay> for sure you should not extend BaseStrutsPortletAction
11:41 <@rotty3000:#liferay> as for the mapping of /portal/login/create_account nor overriding the /login/create_account mapping in struts config
11:42 <@rotty3000:#liferay> I'm not sure if that's a limitation of our "convention"
11:42 <@rotty3000:#liferay> :(
11:42 <@rotty3000:#liferay> it likely is
11:43 < jardineworks:#liferay> what do you mean limitation of your convention?
11:44 <@rotty3000:#liferay> so the convention is that mappings to /portal are mapped to a "portal" request, while anything else is mapped (And must be invoked) by a "portlet" request
11:44 < jardineworks:#liferay> I se
11:44 <@rotty3000:#liferay> hence there may be a "blind spot" in that convention for mappings which are "portal" level, but which don't begin with "/portal"
11:45 < jardineworks:#liferay> soo ... here is what I think might work. :) Let me know what you think.
11:45 < jardineworks:#liferay> 1. I need to have the mapping set to /login/create_account in order to override the action (same as the portal)
11:45 < jardineworks:#liferay> 2. In my XXXOAuth handlers, I need to create a portletURL instead of doing a response.redirect.
11:45 < jardineworks:#liferay> does that sound right?
11:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> because the issue last week was that I was trying to do a response.redirect and it was not working (until I made it /portal/login/create_account for the mapping)
11:47 < jardineworks:#liferay> bust
11:47 < jardineworks:#liferay> I just tried it with /login/create_account and now I get the forward does not exist :(\
11:48 < jardineworks:#liferay> I'm lost.
11:57 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, have you done this by chance?
11:58 < jardineworks:#liferay> I swear I had this working before.
12:39 < jardineworks:#liferay> anyone?
15:06 < jardineworks:#liferay> ok -- got past that issue but have a new one.
15:07 < jardineworks:#liferay> Once I do the create account, I am building a PortletURL in an effort to route the request to the action phase of the /login/login action path. With the email and password as parameters in the request, I expect it to be able to execute the login.
15:08 < jardineworks:#liferay> but right now I am being returned the sign in portlet with an invalid credentials error.
15:08 < jardineworks:#liferay> is this one anyone knows how to get around?
15:40 < jardineworks:#liferay> :(
