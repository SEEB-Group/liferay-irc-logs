06:18 < hufg:#liferay> is there a token to display article id in content template
06:32 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> It should be somwhere in the request, shouldn't it?
06:32 < hufg:#liferay> hmm
06:32 < hufg:#liferay> i want to show article id in web content
06:32 < hufg:#liferay> ie. create article -> put article on page -> it shows the article id
06:33 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I would assume that you have to extract it from the request.
06:34 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> $request should be available in a template.
06:35 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> There is also $layout I think, which might contain the information as well, but I'm not sure.
06:36 < hufg:#liferay> it's not there
06:36 < hufg:#liferay> but the enclosing div from web content display has it
06:36 < hufg:#liferay> <div id="article_10156_10556_127512_1.0" class="journal-content-article">
06:36 < hufg:#liferay> which is just as fine
06:37 < hufg:#liferay> just needs some more jquery trickery
06:38 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Nasty.
06:39 < hufg:#liferay> ahh no it's not fine
06:39 < hufg:#liferay> that will not do
06:39 < hufg:#liferay> it needs to be in article content
06:42 < hufg:#liferay> and it needs to come easily hehe ie. no complex db queries or anything like that
06:44 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Hm. But there has to be some request data available.
06:44 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Worst case: $xmlRequest
06:47 < hufg:#liferay> yeah but it's not guaranteed it contains the article id
06:49 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Mhm. But the request has to contain the article ID. How else would Liferay know what to render?
06:50 < hufg:#liferay> the "portlet" configuration of each layout is in db it can come from there
06:53 < hufg:#liferay> my use case is the following: mark certain special articles with html/css, add article id to content --> this marking and article id will allow me to make some shortcuts for the user
06:53 < hufg:#liferay> then i can do like: hey here is a special article, ooh it has an article id of xxx --> here is your shortcut to xxx
06:57 < hufg:#liferay> $reserved-article-id.data
06:57 < hufg:#liferay> yes
06:57 < hufg:#liferay> a token for journal transformers would be even better
06:59 < hufg:#liferay> i have a vibe this can be done somehow
07:03 < hufg:#liferay> the difference between velocity var and token is that with token i don't have to mess with the templates
07:05 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Mhm mhm.
10:42 < jardineworks:#liferay> rotty3000, or jhf  are you guys around for a qq?
10:42 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik,  you're on the list too!
10:43 < jardineworks:#liferay> I have a site import from my dev that I am pulling into my staging. I know I can do it from the control panel, obviously, but is there a way to do it from the command line? ... basically make is a build step?
16:28 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey jhf -- can you think of a reason why a web content display portlet, that has the permissions set to VIEW for guest, on content, structure and template, would not be appearing unless a user is logged in?
17:04 < Nudge:#liferay> Hello everybody
17:05 < Nudge:#liferay> A question from me for tonight: Is there a possibility to create a template to display a _single_ DDL entry?
17:06 < Nudge:#liferay> The display templates seems to render the whole list and the form display does not allow me to write vm.
