03:09 < hufg:#liferay> goood morning
03:29 < hufg:#liferay> ahh how do i show 404 in site content?
04:24 < mls_:#liferay> hi there
04:26 < mls_:#liferay> I m trying to convert a 5.2.3 hook to our new 6.1 install. Hook was changing stuff in html/portal/layout/edit/common.jspf (adding some menu). Where should I add this menu now in 6.1 ? I would like it in the "personnal fields" section.
04:27 < mls_:#liferay> (custom fields*)
04:50 < hufg:#liferay> well
04:51 < hufg:#liferay> just track down the jsp file
04:54 < mls_:#liferay> just discovered you don't have anymore to do it with a hook (the common.jspf isn't existing anymore in 6.1)
06:12 < mls_:#liferay> problem here with [HotDeployEvent:109] Plugin test-hook requires portal-compat-hook. Any idea ?
06:13 < mls_:#liferay> (liferay 6.1.1 sdk on 6.1.2 here)
06:38 < hufg:#liferay> ehm
06:38 < hufg:#liferay> wild guess that there are some requirements in plugin properties'
06:39 < hufg:#liferay> any way to create pages with no ancestors?
06:39 < hufg:#liferay> ie. detached from navigation
06:42 < hufg:#liferay> yess it is right there in ui
08:15 < THITY:#liferay> Hello, looking to pay someone to setup Liferay for us.  Is there anyone interested/could you put me in touch with someone who will be willing to do this?
09:15 < mls_:#liferay> Liferay 6.1 : $dynamicQuery = $dynamicQueryFactoryUtil.forClass($layoutClass).add($restrictionsFactoryUtil.eq("friendlyurl", $login))) is not working (returning nothing). Any idea ?
09:16 < mls_:#liferay> none of the objects are null, and $login = /login (exists in table Layout)
09:50 < nikiforo:#liferay> can I export roles from liferay?
10:00 < jardineworks:#liferay> nikiforo, I don't think so.
10:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> nikiforo, I remember seeing an LPS issue that someone opened because it wouldn't do it and the response if I remember correctly was that you could not do that in Liferay
10:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> the cheat you could use is the Server Administrator > Data Migration perhaps
10:02 < jardineworks:#liferay> but that would do the whole databsae of course.
10:02 < jardineworks:#liferay> so if you don't want to overwrite everything then you would need to backup target database, do the migration, and then restore all but the Roles* tables.
10:03 < jardineworks:#liferay> // or
10:03 < jardineworks:#liferay> .. you could write your own script to do it via remote interfaces.
10:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> pull them from source and then add them to target
10:18 < nikiforo:#liferay> thanks!
10:18 < jardineworks:#liferay> nikiforo, np.. that has been on my list to do for a while... just not a priority, otherwise I would share with you.
10:34 < mls_:#liferay> hi
10:35 < mls_:#liferay> I've some problems with dynamicQuery in .vm files with 6.1. It was working with 5.2.3 but not anymore in 6.1. Any idea ?
10:35 < mls_:#liferay> #set ($dynamicQuery = $dynamicQueryFactoryUtil.forClass($igImageClass).add($restrictionsFactoryUtil.eq("name", $catsNorm))) is not set
11:17 < mls_:#liferay> anyone here ? =/
11:23 < jardineworks:#liferay> I'm here but not sure I can help mls
11:23 < jardineworks:#liferay> maybe give me some more background?
11:24 < jardineworks:#liferay> what is that squery trying to do? Select images but only from a certain category?
16:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey adaro have you don any work with DynamicQueries?
16:54 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Somehow hearing all these talks is depressing.
16:54 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Because I'm pretty sure we will not move to 6.2 soon and now I REALLY WANT TO.
16:54 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> -.-
17:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, is it more awesome than 6.1?!
17:01 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> They put a lot of very awesome stuff in there.
17:02 < jardineworks:#liferay> are they committing to a release date yet? :)
17:02 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> First of rotty's work on OSGi module setup, new control panel, application display template (yay!), previews for different devices from within Liferay directly in the browser...
17:02 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Very exiting stuff.
17:04 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> And no...no release date. Only plans for further candidates in a rolling release cycle.
17:05 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Until everybody is happy with the result. ;)
17:06 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Mhm. jardineworks, I have a question from a co-worker here...maybe you have an answer to that. He just found out that the ServiceBuilder entities can't store NULL values in the database. They are somehow converted to 0.
17:06 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Any thoughts on that?
17:07 < jardineworks:#liferay> not really. I mean, the only real requirement (in my mind) is that you have a predictable value to check for an empty value.
17:07 < jardineworks:#liferay> Are you sure you can't store nulls? or was that specifically for numeric values?
17:07 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Well...defining 0 as NULL is really weird.
17:07 < jardineworks:#liferay> Is that a Liferay thing of a hibernate thing?
17:08 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> No idea. I never encountered it with Hibernate before.
17:08 < jardineworks:#liferay> hmmm
17:08 < jardineworks:#liferay> well, as I said, it is a little odd I suppose, but as long as it is predictable right?
17:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> besides, best practices really mean you should be checking to expected values, not the other stuff :)
17:09 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> To be honest...I'm not a big fan of ServiceBuilder.
17:09 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> No foreign keys, no null values...
17:10 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Almost seems like it would have been best to keep it as an internal development tool and never release it to the public. Doesn't seem suited for that somehow.
17:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> I love SB
17:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> it was the first thing that made me fall in love with Liferay
17:10 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Docmentation is sparse and the amount of possible pitfalls is annoying as f***.
17:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> makes it so easy to extend the model!
17:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> and it does 90% of the boring work for you
17:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> easy to maintain
17:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> easy to adjust
17:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> .. I have replicated it on projects for external apis
17:11 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> But you have to bend entirely to the odd choices that apparently have been made by the Liferay devs.
17:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> the one I am on now for example... I use freemarker with an xml config to generate about 200 classes
17:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> you bend to a model that is used by Liferay... which makes sense since you are developing FOR liferay :)
17:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> its like building portlets that are only going to be deployed in LR but not using MVCPortlet. To me it makes little sense
17:12 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Yeah...but in that case it would be really helpful to have a comprehensive documentation for that.
17:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> oh well.. welcome to open source my friend :)
17:12 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Stuff like "there are no foreign keys", "don't bet on NULL values" etc.
17:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> gotta make your money somehow (services)
17:13 < jardineworks:#liferay> fair enough ... but you are lucky man. The amount of documentation that exists now is AWESOME compared to what it was in 5 or lower.
17:13 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> *sigh* In general I don't care...but that limited time budget of ours really starts to become a problem if things like that keep popping up.
17:14 < jardineworks:#liferay> but part of that is inexperience right? I bet if you had 3 or 4 LR projects under your belt you would be able to whip through a project.
17:14 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> And I'm not a fan of having to use 0 instad of NULL when we are trying to establish a proper architecture for your stuff.
17:14 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> your = our
17:14 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> (Great typo...one letter and the entire meaning is turned 180 degrees. Funny..)
17:16 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Sure. Part of it is inexperience. No doubt about that. But non-default architectural choices are really hard to foresee.
17:16 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> And in my mind it so far was a standard to use NULL values for optional fields and foreign keys for relationships.
17:16 < jardineworks:#liferay> the NULL thing can easily be fixed with a Validator.isNull override that checks for a 0 as well as BLANK as well as null.
17:16 < jardineworks:#liferay> i've certainly seen worse :)
17:17 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Well...the problem is that we wanted to use custom SQL for some of the finders we will need.
17:17 < jardineworks:#liferay> DynamicQuery
17:17 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> And there "WHERE foo IS NULL" is way clearer than "WHERE foo = 0"
17:17 < jardineworks:#liferay> are you sure that is not just for numbers?
17:18 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> No idea...but it's an ID field, so it has to be a number.
17:18 < jardineworks:#liferay> one of my service builder tables seems to have nulls in it
17:18 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> And we wanted to add foreign keys to it but if we can't have NULL if no relationship is in place, we can't do that.
17:19 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Because an entry 0 doesn't exist.
17:19 < jardineworks:#liferay> well, that is definitely something that LR doesn't enforce -- and I have mixed feelings about it. Its nice from a delete perspective... but if you are not careful it can certainly make a mess.
17:19 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I think I read somewhere that NULL for Strings works.
17:21 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> You know...it is possible to work around those things...but it just feels strange to already walk off the "proper" path so early in the project.
17:22 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> At least it feels like that. Well...I guess we'll just have to swallow the pill and continue.
17:25 < jardineworks:#liferay> part of the medication you take when you work with a product right? they all have their quirks that don't make sense. The only way around it is to custom build which, I personally, think is a bit of a waste of time and money these days.
17:25 < jardineworks:#liferay> and you rarely get a product that is ACTUALLY better.
17:25 < jardineworks:#liferay> I have surrendered myself to the fact that I am not the worlds best programmer :)
17:26 < jardineworks:#liferay> besides, I would rather focus on the actual business challenges rather than trying to integrate a billion frameworks to avoid writing boiler plate code.
17:26 < jardineworks:#liferay> just my perspective though
17:26 < jardineworks:#liferay> Part of the reason I can charge my clients what I do is because I can complete their projects in less time then they think it will take. Liferay, for me, mitigates a lot of that risk for me.
17:26 < jardineworks:#liferay> so I <3 it
17:26 < jardineworks:#liferay> :)
17:27 < jardineworks:#liferay> I should be an evangelist. Where is jhf when you need him ;)
17:27 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> About 1km from here, probably in the hotel bar. ;)
17:28 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I guess I would have a much easier time in this project if we actually had someone with some Liferay experience.
17:28 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Rather than just me trying to struggle through too much stuff in too less time.
17:53 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Btw...my most liked feature in 6.2 so far definitely are Application Display Templates.
17:53 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Did you hear about those?
18:06 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Oh. Wow. So late. Got to go. I'll leave you with my favorite quote from today's talks: "jQuery is the Justin Bieber of the web."
18:09 < apucay:#liferay> is that a knock on jquery or bieber?
