01:58 < hufg> helloo helloo
01:59 < hufg> language change links generated by $taglibLiferay.language hit the cache without ever going to the language portlet
01:59 < hufg> what is this?!
01:59 < hufg> If-None-Match is present in the header
01:59 < hufg> ie. the language won't change
02:09 < hufg> i c
02:09 < hufg> hmm how do i prevent this?
02:34 < sgeef> good morning to all of you guys ;)
02:38 < sgeef> Does somebody has a good explanation why it can be better in any case to choice for storage using Journal Article with different structures over a custom entity by a service builder?
02:40 < x9183111> sgeef: reusability, maybe
02:42 < x9183111> And JA is a core LR model
02:43 < x9183111> It can be accessed in any servlet
02:43 < x9183111> from*
03:35 < hufg> anyone on the if-none-match language switch? :(
03:39 < sgeef> x9182111 mm intresting, do you know any articles about this?
03:53 < x9183111> sgeef: don't know articles, but check this posting: http://t.bvakili.com/lr-classloading-across-servlet-contexts
03:53 < x9183111> sgeef: one way is to manually put the *-service.jar in ${CATALINA_HOME}/lib/ext dir
03:54 < x9183111> So all servlet contexts can see the class
03:57 < sgeef> o thanks for this information..
03:57 < sgeef> :)
04:06 < hufg> how are local cache matches prevented on "dynamic" requests anyhow?
04:08 < hufg> the browser determines if header fields related to cache should be sent?
04:10 < mvlach> hello all :)
04:10 < hufg> maybe liferays etagfilter is configured wrong
04:11 < mvlach> can somebody help me with Liferay and Spring portlets ? I have successfully created portlets but now, when I added the JPA (Hibernate) I'm facing with SLF4J problem (versions)
04:23 < hufg> check out the package after deploying the portlet
04:23 < hufg> i have no clue but there is a some logging lib added to the deployed package
04:23 < hufg> can't remember
04:24 < mvlach> may, spring 3.2.4 is not suitable for liferay 6.1
04:24 < mvlach> now I playing with 3.1 and this problem is gone
04:26 < hufg> going to eat now but the following ignore url pattern sufficient?
04:26 < hufg>                 <init-param>                         <param-name>url-regex-ignore-pattern</param-name>                         <param-value>.+/-/.+</param-value>                 </init-param>
04:26 < hufg> blabla
04:26 < mvlach>  org.springframework.beans.factory.NoSuchBeanDefinitionException: No unique bean of type [javax.persistence.EntityManagerFactory] is defined
04:27 < mvlach> 	<bean
04:27 < mvlach> 		class="org.springframework.orm.jpa.LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean"
04:27 < mvlach> 		id="entityManagerFactory">
05:15 < mvlach> problem is with applicationContext.xml and dms-portlet.xml
05:15 < mvlach> applicationContext.xml is not loaded
05:29 < sgeef> x9182111, see this: http://www.liferay.com/es/marketplace/-/mp/application/25619448 about the question that i had yesterday.
05:30 < sgeef> But then i stay with the question if i can make the updating and saving custom without having to make a ext plugin
05:35 < x9183111> sgeef: awesome, sounds exactly like what you need.
05:43 < sgeef> x918311, kinda.. The thing is that i am looking for a way to change the workflowhandler.. without using ext-plugins.
05:43 < sgeef> but can't find it..
05:44 < sgeef> because i have to do some custom version numbering.. and that kind of stuff.. which i like to control.. but can't believe that the only way is ext-plugin.
05:46 < x9183111> sgeef: in workflow script, call the setVersion, no?
05:51 < sgeef> x9183111, ok fair enough xD that was an easy one.. But now for example i need to pass all the data that will be safed trough a  XSLT script to clean it up from certain elements..
05:51 < sgeef> saved*
05:53 < x9183111> Can you put the transform function in global lib? e.g. ${CATALINA_HOME}/lib/ext?
05:53 < sgeef> these can be approached from a workflow?
05:54 < sgeef> because i think i can do that.
05:55 < x9183111> Yes, it will be visible then; it's fine.
06:12 < sgeef> X9183111, intresting
07:38 < x9183111> a
10:02 -!- jhf changed the topic of #liferay to: Liferay Community Discussion Channel!  Plz be patient - timezones matter :)  Liferay 6.2 Beta: http://goo.gl/C4gc1e Marketplace App Contest http://goo.gl/H9oJb  Forum: http://forums.liferay.com Liferay 6.1 GA2: http://bit.ly/MbDcUF
11:22 < LRAdminInNeed9> Hi, can I set different workflows based on web content structure?
11:22 < HelpfulIRCUser> LRAdminInNeed9: Per sgeef earlier, see this plugin in the Liferay Marketplace: http://www.liferay.com/es/marketplace/-/mp/application/25619448
12:35 < Naenyn> rotty3000: good morning.. do you have a sec to discuss http://issues.liferay.com/browse/LPS-38742 ?
13:02 < Naenyn> rotty3000: just wondering if locally scoped document libraries will still be copied as expected.
13:19 < LRAdminInNeed9> test
13:19 < x9183111> test
13:22 < LRAdminInNeed9> test
13:44 < LRAdminInNeed9> test
13:47 < james314159> test
13:50 < LRAdminInNeed9> test
13:51 < x9183111> test
13:58 < Naenyn> any particular reason you're testing your bot here and not in some random test channel? =]
15:36 <@jhf> yeah LRAdminInNeed and friends
15:37 <@jhf> whats the deal?
15:38 < james314159> Don't know why they're doing it.  I was just following the crowd.
17:01 < jardineworks> jhf, rotty3000 , do you know if there are any issues running LR locally with IPv6?
17:02 <@rotty3000> Naenyn: you mean instaging?
17:02 <@rotty3000> Naenyn: they should!
17:02 <@rotty3000> jardineworks: hmm, theoretically no, but there might be some of our libs.. and even some of our features which have not been well tested on IPV6
17:03 <@jhf> are we out of IPv4 addresses yet?
17:03 <@rotty3000> jhf, we technically are..
17:04 < jardineworks> didn't the world run out of IPv4 like 10 years ago? and we invented NAT :)?
17:04 < jardineworks> I am getting a strange start up error...
17:04 < jardineworks> 20:46:25,874 ERROR [http-bio-8080-exec-2][error_jsp:422] User ID null

17:04 < jardineworks> wait... "turning it off and on again" seems to have fixed it.
17:04 < jardineworks> never mind :)
18:37 < Naenyn> rotty3000: thanks =]
18:38 < Naenyn> We've never actually done anything special with the staging/publishing feature..
18:41 < Naenyn> kinda makes me wonder if we're using it as intended. =]
