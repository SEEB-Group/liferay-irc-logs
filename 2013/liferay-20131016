03:26 < Axxell:#liferay> hey guys
03:27 < Axxell:#liferay> a user had a problem with some controls so i found that there was a problem with liferay 6.1.1 to 6.1.2 upgrade
03:27 < Axxell:#liferay> so i run liferay with verify.frequency=-1 and it screwed up my databas
03:27 < Axxell:#liferay> e
03:28 < Axxell:#liferay> PLEASE HELP, is there anything i can do to restore it to it previous state? i thought i had backups
03:28 < Axxell:#liferay> but ofcourse not
03:35 < hufg:#liferay> :Z
03:35 < hufg:#liferay> wow
03:35 < hufg:#liferay> you have ce?
03:36 < hufg:#liferay> copy data, create lab env, revert back to 6.1.1 see what happens
03:36 < hufg:#liferay> IMO no db modifications happen in ce GA2 -> GA3
03:36 < hufg:#liferay> how did it screw the database?
03:37 < Axxell:#liferay> it gives the error
03:37 < Axxell:#liferay> The database contains changes from a previous upgrade attempt that failed. Please restore the old database and file system and retry the upgrade. A patch may be required if the upgrade failed due to a bug or an unforeseen data permutation that resulted from a corrupt database.
03:37 < Axxell:#liferay> my assumption that a "verify" would just verify
03:37 < Axxell:#liferay> not screw up the database
03:37 < hufg:#liferay> mm no idea, yeah that is weird i'd look into it
03:37 < Axxell:#liferay> hence i did not make a backup
03:37 < hufg:#liferay> it may jsut be some weird check somewhere
03:38 < hufg:#liferay> anyways your best bet is to see what changes happened and check if you can revert
03:38 < Axxell:#liferay> there is a release_ table
03:38 < Axxell:#liferay> where there is a state
03:39 < Axxell:#liferay> there error comes at 	at com.liferay.portal.tools.DBUpgrader._checkReleaseState(DBUpgrader.java:300)
03:39 < hufg:#liferay> yeah see a simple check it may be
03:39 < Axxell:#liferay> the state is 2, and i do not knwo what that state should be
03:39 < hufg:#liferay> that was poetic
03:39 < hufg:#liferay> well start reading the source
03:39 < Axxell:#liferay> state=1 would be a guess
03:39 < hufg:#liferay> don't gues
03:39 < hufg:#liferay> read
03:40 < hufg:#liferay> it's your only hope that nothing really happened, otherwise it's fuckd
03:40 < hufg:#liferay> that was crazy anyhow to upgrade a production environment even with backups
03:41 < hufg:#liferay> it's like trying to win the lottery
03:41 < Axxell:#liferay> apparently 0
03:41 < Axxell:#liferay> http://grepcode.com/file/repo1.maven.org/maven2/com.liferay.portal/portal-service/6.1.1/com/liferay/portal/model/ReleaseConstants.java#ReleaseConstants.0DEFAULT_ID
03:41 < hufg:#liferay> now create an environment where you can try this out
03:41 < Axxell:#liferay> this wasnt an upgrade
03:41 < hufg:#liferay> liferay 6.1.1 to 6.1.2 upgrade
03:41 < Axxell:#liferay> this was trying to run a verify with an bad assumption
03:42 < hufg:#liferay> i'm fairly sure you'll be fine
03:42 < Axxell:#liferay> nope the upgrade was 6.1.1 to 6.1.2 which was made a long time ago
03:42 < Axxell:#liferay> the error  a user had
03:42 < Axxell:#liferay> led to an issue
03:42 < hufg:#liferay> ah ok
03:42 < Axxell:#liferay> which said that one should run
03:42 < Axxell:#liferay>  a verify
03:42 < hufg:#liferay> yes yes
03:42 < Axxell:#liferay> my assumption was that a verify doesnt screw up databases
03:43 < Axxell:#liferay> hence the world is burning
03:43 < hufg:#liferay> a somewhat fair assumption
03:44 < Axxell:#liferay> yup a bit of a screw up from me too, not about to deny it, but but
03:45 < hufg:#liferay> mm yeah this is why you have a test environment
03:45 < Axxell:#liferay> changing the state to 0, seems to have made it start and go beyond
03:46 < hufg:#liferay> what db do you have?
03:46 < hufg:#liferay> now get vagrant and get that virtual env going hehe
03:46 < Axxell:#liferay> so lets hope that its ok, and i need to make sure stuff works a bit better
03:46 < Axxell:#liferay> mysql
03:53 < Axxell:#liferay> thanks for the help anyway
07:38 < Axxell:#liferay> hey guys, do you know about some easy way to get some dynamic data into an portlet?
07:38 < Axxell:#liferay> i mean an article
07:47 < hufg:#liferay> what kind of data
07:48 < hufg:#liferay> there are multiple ways
07:48 < hufg:#liferay> aargh how come javascript.barebone.files is messing with autheticated user js files
08:09 < Axxell:#liferay> well i need to be able to print it and/or export it to pdf
08:09 < Axxell:#liferay> hufg: been trying with javascript functions in the "manage page" part of this page, and those dont appear to get into pdf exports or prints
08:11 < Axxell:#liferay> at least not with the print and pdf export buttons of the webcontent portlet
08:46 < modd_:#liferay> jhf: how do you like berlin? ;)
09:18 <@jhf:#liferay> modd_: !!
09:18 <@jhf:#liferay> Berlinâ€¦ I saw about 2 hours of daylight outside the hotel the entire time I was there :)
09:18 <@jhf:#liferay> next time I shall bake in some sightseeing time
09:18 <@jhf:#liferay> food was really good though!
09:18 <@jhf:#liferay> as was the beer.
09:19 <@jhf:#liferay> and the leaves on the trees were beginning to turn fall colors - so was pretty (at least from the plane on arrival :) )
09:30 < modd_:#liferay> ;)
09:30 < modd_:#liferay> now I have one if these liferay bags and a t-shirt
