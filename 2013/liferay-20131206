07:40 < Keferoff:#liferay> Is there a way to export users phone numbers for specific portal?
11:59 < aj_:#liferay> hey guys
12:00 < aj_:#liferay> does anyone know why when I initiate a resource request (using the javascript libraries) from a page under web/guest to a portlet that is on another page it chooses to use /grop/guest instead of /web/guest?
12:01 < aj_:#liferay> ah... because if you do setPlid( "plid", plid) instead of setPlid(plid);
12:36 < anteater_sa:#liferay> q
12:37 < anteater_sa:#liferay> I'm trying to write a portlet in python but am getting an error with this line:
12:37 < anteater_sa:#liferay> obc = OrderByComparatorFactory.create('AssetCategory','name',True)
12:37 < anteater_sa:#liferay> any ideas?
12:42 < aj_:#liferay> whats the error
12:43 < anteater_sa:#liferay> that's the problem, I just get
12:43 < anteater_sa:#liferay> An unexpected error occurred.

12:54 < modd:#liferay> jhf: we found a strange bug in 6.2 EE^^
12:55 < modd:#liferay> after changing the title of the guest landing page from "welcome" to "home" all options for this page were gone
12:55 < modd:#liferay> and we see an exception in layout_admin/edit_layout.jsp
12:56 < modd:#liferay> selLayout.getFriendlyURL() fails
12:59 <@jhf:#liferay> uh oh.. /me tries it
13:00 <@jhf:#liferay> is this w/tomcat?
13:00 < modd:#liferay> I didn't have time to try to reproduce it on another system
13:00 < modd:#liferay> yep
13:21 <@jhf:#liferay> so after logging in, I clicked the "Edit" button on the left, and changed the page title from Welcome to Home. nothing appears broken.
13:22 <@jhf:#liferay> what did u mean by "all options for this page were gone" ?
13:30 < modd:#liferay> on left side you have the new options menu and one of the buttons shows the page options
13:30 < modd:#liferay> this dialog is empty
13:31 < modd:#liferay> it's the same when going to control panel and showing the options for the page there
13:31 < modd:#liferay> it's simply empty
13:31 < modd:#liferay> the exception is a stringindexoutofbound exception: -1
13:31 < modd:#liferay> that's because the friendlyurl is somehow broken
13:41 < haba713:#liferay> hi! when adding documents to liferay 6.1 doclib with service api, must also asset entries be created? have you got any examples?
13:42 <@jhf:#liferay> there are 4 buttons: "Add" (in the shape of a "+"), Preview (looks like a computer monitor), "Edit" (looks like a pencil), and a button to toggle "Edit COntrols"
13:42 <@jhf:#liferay> which one are you pressing to get the exception
13:43 < modd:#liferay> go to your control panel and open the tree view for the site
13:43 < modd:#liferay> and then click on the page title in the tree
13:45 <@jhf:#liferay> ok everything seems right http://imgur.com/X9StqGy
13:45 <@jhf:#liferay> what DB are you using?
13:45 < modd:#liferay> postgres
13:46 <@jhf:#liferay> 9.x?
13:46 < modd:#liferay> not sure, I'm not at work anymore :\
13:46 < modd:#liferay> but that's exactly the page
13:46 <@jhf:#liferay> ok gonna try postgres.
13:47 < modd:#liferay> you don't need to to do it now, I'll try to find reproduction steps next week
13:50 < modd:#liferay> btw, is it possible, that..let's say a random pulse award winner (^^) get's a special acocunt flag at liferay.com to see LPE bugs? (I don't have a EE account anymore :( )
14:15 <@jhf:#liferay> modd: actually that's an interesting proposal, I will ask around
14:15 < modd:#liferay> cool^^
14:15 <@jhf:#liferay> we've talked about giving for example EE discounts for high volume contributors
14:15 <@jhf:#liferay> this is sorta the same thing.
14:16 < modd:#liferay> in most cases some kind of free EE developer version would be great. I don't need a production license for testing
