07:26 < hufg:#liferay> wadap
08:25 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey hufg
08:25 < hufg:#liferay> yoyo
08:28 < jardineworks:#liferay> hufg, just out of curiosity, where are you located?
08:32 < hufg:#liferay> finland
08:32 < hufg:#liferay> 8)
08:35 < nikiforo:#liferay> town?
08:36 < nikiforo:#liferay> just of curiosity :)
08:40 < hufg:#liferay> helsinki
08:42 < jardineworks:#liferay> cool -- I've always wanted to see Finland. Haven't made it there yet
08:42 < hufg:#liferay> :)
08:43 < hufg:#liferay> definitively worth visiting!
08:48 < jardineworks:#liferay> I've been dying to visint the scandanavian countries for years actually. The closest I have gotten was marrying a swede :)
08:49 < hufg:#liferay> hehe
08:54 < hufg:#liferay> where are you located?
08:54 < hufg:#liferay> i think you have mentioned canade
08:55 < hufg:#liferay> canada
09:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> yeah -- Toronto, Canada
09:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> how long have you been working with Liferay?
09:19 < hufg:#liferay> 1 year maintaining and 1 year building
09:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> are you independent? or do you work for a firm that uses it?
09:20 < hufg:#liferay> firm that uses it
09:20 < hufg:#liferay> atm our project is at the later stages, we have designed the infrastructure and done everything from scratch
09:21 < hufg:#liferay> maintaining a site doesn't teach you much
09:22 < hufg:#liferay> a bit, but not much
09:24 < jardineworks:#liferay> true -- raw dev and extension is the best way to learn. That or trying to debug an issue :)
09:24 < hufg:#liferay> yeah
09:24 < hufg:#liferay> and we have had the opportunity to do technical pocs with everything
09:25 < hufg:#liferay> that's probably rare
09:25 < hufg:#liferay> the end result is so much better
09:25 < hufg:#liferay> just been going latest and greatest until something fails 8)
09:26 < jardineworks:#liferay> have you played with 6.2 yet?
09:26 < hufg:#liferay> no, we will wait until the final release
09:31 < hufg:#liferay> jardineworks: there is a showstopper when upgrading from 6.1 GA2 to GA3 and latest 6.2
09:31 < hufg:#liferay> ce
09:32 < jardineworks:#liferay> was this the asset publisher thing I saw you and rotty talking about?
09:33 < hufg:#liferay> yes, a document library thing
09:34 < hufg:#liferay> you work independent right?
09:36 < jardineworks:#liferay> yessir
09:36 < jardineworks:#liferay> good time for me because Liferay is still a pretty quiet product in Canada, but it is starting to gain a bit of ground. I am pushing it pretty hard here in Toronto and have a couple of companies that are looking like they are going to keystone it for their business.
09:39 < hufg:#liferay> do you work actually independent independent not as a consultant in a consultant firm?
09:44 < hufg:#liferay> jardineworks: ever noticed that staging publish is slooow? :D
09:45 < hufg:#liferay> man i had a grand idea to mount /tmp as tmpfs on rhel and publish time went way down, not fast enough though
09:54 < jardineworks:#liferay> I am fully independent, though most of my clients are larger firms. I show them the benefits of LR, and they have convinced their clients to use them. I have a few independents (smaller orgs) that are either in the process of figuring it out with me, or actively listening to what I am saying (sales pitch).
09:54 < jardineworks:#liferay> I haven't done anything with staging yet but I should be soon. Is it slow, because of the volume? or does the volume have no impact?
10:00 < hufg:#liferay> volume
10:00 < hufg:#liferay> and poor implementation
10:00 < jardineworks:#liferay> its a new concept in 6.1 right?
10:00 < hufg:#liferay> shitty might be more appropriate
10:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> I don't remember seeing it in 6...
10:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> lol
10:01 < hufg:#liferay> may be
10:01 < hufg:#liferay> here they have a habit of doing their own publishing implementation
10:01 < hufg:#liferay> and it costs shit ton of money to do it, but if you are an independent contractor it's good for you right? :D
10:02 < jardineworks:#liferay> hahah
10:02 < jardineworks:#liferay> yes :)
10:02 < jardineworks:#liferay> BUT
10:02 < jardineworks:#liferay> I discourage my clients to do such things
10:03 < jardineworks:#liferay> I try to push them to use as much of the OOTB as they can.
10:03 < jardineworks:#liferay> AND... to stick to the model as best possible
10:03 < hufg:#liferay> 8)
10:04 < hufg:#liferay> truly independent contracting is pretty weird, i don't think it actually exists here
10:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> I used to work for big organizations. For YEARS I was the technical lead on accounts helping clients flush out requirements, defining architectures, running teams etc. In the end I realize that those companies are NEVER doing anything in the best interests of the client. They are always out to bleed as much as they can in a single engagement,
10:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> it made me sick.
10:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> so I decided to go out on my own.
10:05 < hufg:#liferay> mm
10:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> I charge a price that seems high for an independent but when compared to those monsters ... like Accenture, CIGNEX, etc... its nothing.
10:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> BUT
10:06 < jardineworks:#liferay> I never oversell. I always encourage them to spend only what they need to. To piece meal projects.. eat a slice, don't eat the whole pizza at once.
10:06 < jardineworks:#liferay> bottom line...
10:06 < jardineworks:#liferay> I am honest.
10:06 < hufg:#liferay> yeah that's good
10:06 < jardineworks:#liferay> and to date, it has worked out for me. I can sleep at night. Clients appreciate it. It allows me to do better work and I have a backlog of clients waiting for me time because they know they can trust me,
10:07 < jardineworks:#liferay> One fo the companies I worked for used to bill me out for 350 USD an hour.
10:07 < jardineworks:#liferay> I don't care who you are... NO ONE is worth that.
10:07 < hufg:#liferay> :-D
10:07 < jardineworks:#liferay> its just gross.
10:08 < jardineworks:#liferay> and if you need to bill me out at that much to cover your costs and make a reasonable... REASONABLE as in not 300% margin, amount of money? then maybe you should hire someone to audit who you run your business because you suck at it :)
10:09 < hufg:#liferay> 8)
13:48 < Dev123:#liferay> When I link my page from a message on linkedIn, it's not as pretty dislayed as for other sites (e.g. a picture and some text displayed)
13:48 < Dev123:#liferay> It there anything that may have with LIferay to do?
