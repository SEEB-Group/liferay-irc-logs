01:59 < ktwo> Hi, is anyone here who could help me to achieve the following task (however without WAI and similar). I need a Standalone Webapp to be deployed on the same Server with Portal. Any advice? Most specifically. How can i avoid the Liferay bridge being used when calling FaceletServlet
03:47 < modd_> Found a small typo: Knowledge Base EE and CE -> WEB-INF/portlet.xml -> the <resource-bundle> tag contains „content.Language“ instead of „content/Language“ -> https://github.com/liferay/liferay-plugins/blob/master/portlets/knowledge-base-portlet/docroot/WEB-INF/portlet.xml#L28 (there are more lines with this tag...)
03:52 < modd_> I can see this in other portlet codes, too, but in these cases I'm getting just the language key and not the translated code. after changing this, everything works fine again (LR EE 6.1.20 with latest patches)
07:32 < hufg> hellooo
07:34 < hufg> my theme fails to deploy in a peculiar way
07:34 < hufg> ./WEB-INF/lib/util-java.jar and ./WEB-INF/lib/util-taglib.jar do not get copied into the theme
07:34 < hufg> and the deployment will print an error message "java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: com.liferay.util.bean.PortletBeanLocatorUtil"
07:34 < hufg> the theme works only partially after that
07:51 < hufg> shouldn't the live group be accessible without virtualhost?
07:51 < hufg> now it isn't, page load is like 1min because of timeouts with the group address if virtualhost is enabled
08:21 < mvlach> hello
08:22 < mvlach> is possible to have more sites on liferay - with another URL ?
08:22 < mvlach> so I can't set correctly URL to portal.someadress.cz to portal web (LF 6.1)
08:27 < hufg> what what
08:27 < hufg> yes yes virtualhost
08:29 < hufg> new site -> set virtualhost on public pages to my.site.com, get something to map to your server
08:33 < mvlach> hello hufg
08:33 < hufg> hello my main man mvlach
08:33 < mvlach> there is two addresses - public and private
08:34 < mvlach> i have only private pages
08:34 < mvlach> but I can't login, when I set portal.site.cz
08:34 < mvlach> maybe is there bug in LF
08:34 < hufg> to private?
08:35 < mvlach> to private
08:35 < mvlach> sometimes portal show page without styles
08:35 < hufg> uhm yeah
08:35 < hufg> but it's not a bug
08:35 < hufg> with which address did you try it?
08:35 < hufg> or maybe it is but anyhow eventually that crap works
08:36 < mvlach> so priendly URL is /volvo
08:36 < mvlach> public pages portal.volvodirect.cz
08:37 < hufg> access without virtualhost (server:port/something) -> page loads a long time a few objects timeout because theme jsps
08:37 < mvlach> private I dont know what have to set
08:37 < mvlach> I created very simle pages http://www.janavlachova.cz/
08:38 < mvlach> and there is only one Web and URL works good
08:38 < mvlach> bu on my local LF I have two webs and cannot setup the virtual hosts
08:39 < mvlach> The requested resource was not found.
08:39 < mvlach> http://portal.volvodirect.cz/
08:39 < hufg> it works? :D
08:39 < hufg> after you login it doesn't?
08:40 < hufg> are you sure something maps the private virtualhost url to the actual server
08:42 < mvlach> where to map - in DNS ?
08:42 < hufg> hmm no
08:42 < hufg> some load balancer or web server apache?
08:43 < hufg> proxy server
08:43 < hufg> request to private.virtual.host -> redirect to server:port
08:43 < mvlach>  ProxyPreserveHost On
08:43 < mvlach>     ProxyPass / http://localhost:8080/
08:43 < mvlach>     ProxyPassReverse / http://localhost:8080/
08:46 < mvlach> when I would like to get page http://portal.volvodirect.cz/c/portal/login
08:46 < mvlach> I get Permission exception
08:47 < mvlach> portal.volvodirect.cz is set as private virtualhost of web volvo
08:47 < mvlach> :(
08:47 < mvlach> i think this is the problem
08:47 < mvlach> http://issues.liferay.com/browse/LPS-23365
08:51 < hufg> :Z maybe
08:51 < jardineworks> rotty3000, too early or are you around?
08:57 < mvlach> so there is workaround - I have to create at least one public page
10:21 < Tar-Minyatur> rotty3000: https://issues.liferay.com/browse/LPS-25275 <-- I guess that's the issue we were talking about yesterday. Sorry that I forgot to mention, that we're stuck with a 6.1.0...totally my fault. -.-
10:41 < Tar-Minyatur> Has anyone ever encountered a problem with permissions when working with a custom portlet?
10:42 < Tar-Minyatur> We're using actionUrl as action for a form and sometimes Liferay refuses to show the page and reports a permission problem instead.
10:42 < Tar-Minyatur> But it's not really reproduceable. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't and I can't find the pattern. :-/
10:45 < Tar-Minyatur> By now the only solution I could find is to disable the auth token stuff and hope for the best...which is not very satisfactory.
10:52 < topolik> Tar-Minyatur: Hi, action urls are guarded by CSRF token which is different with every user session => you can get the problem with token for example when the session expires
10:53 < Tar-Minyatur> That should take like 30 minutes or something.
10:54 < Tar-Minyatur> I didn't need quite that much time to fill out the form. ;)
10:55 < topolik> btw. I don't recommend to disable the tokens, that's a very very bad solution
10:55 < Tar-Minyatur> I would deactivate it for this portlet only.
10:56 < Tar-Minyatur> It's just a signup form for some weird raffle or something.
10:56 < Tar-Minyatur> And users can't login to the site anyway.
10:56 < topolik> ok, then it should be ok :)
11:30 <@rotty3000> topolik: could it be that the token in case of non-authenticated user is being shared among requests?
11:30 <@rotty3000> topolik: and so being invalidated randomly by some other request?
11:30 < topolik> no
11:30 <@rotty3000> ok just making sure
11:30 < topolik> n/p
11:31 < topolik> but the server may generate always new jsessionid
11:32 < Tar-Minyatur> It's a very odd issue, because I can't really reproduce it reliably.
11:32 < Tar-Minyatur> Probably it's just a 6.1.0 bug that has already been fixed.
11:32 < Tar-Minyatur> *sigh*
11:34 < topolik> Tar-Minyatur: I have an idea
11:35 < topolik> portal adds ;jsessionid=xxxxx into URLs when you access a page for the first time
11:36 < topolik> but it's possible that it refuses to read it on next request
11:36 < topolik> which would cause this odd behaivour
11:36 < topolik> can you verify it?
11:36 < Tar-Minyatur> We have cookie sessions enabled, so no appending to URLs. At least not that I can see.
11:37 < topolik> did you turn off session.enable.url.with.session.id ?
11:37 < Tar-Minyatur> The actionUrl doesn't contain a jsessionid parameter.
11:38 < Tar-Minyatur> I opened the page in a anonymous browser instance, so it should not load anything from my cookies or anything.
11:39 < topolik> it's not a parameter, but if you don't see it anywhere in the URL then I am wrong :)
11:39 < Tar-Minyatur> Oh.
11:39 < Tar-Minyatur> Maybe you are right.
11:40 < Tar-Minyatur> I had to call the page directly.
11:40 < Tar-Minyatur> Mhm. Odd.
11:40 < Tar-Minyatur> Yeah.
11:40 < Tar-Minyatur> First time I open the page there is a jsessionid in the actionUrl.
11:41 < Tar-Minyatur> I'll try if that's what's causing this problem.
11:43 < Tar-Minyatur> Why would that be a problem anyway?
11:44 < Tar-Minyatur> Shouldn't that make sure that the session is not lost and thus prevent the authToken issue from happening?
11:44 < topolik> the problem may be when app server refuses to use that jsessionid from url
11:45 < topolik> and generates new session
11:45 < topolik> with new token
11:45 < Tar-Minyatur> Mhm.
11:47 < Tar-Minyatur> Well...that doesn't seem to be the problem anyway.
11:47 < Tar-Minyatur> I just got the "You do not have permission to access the requested resource." message and I checked before whether jsessionid is present and it was not.
11:48 < Tar-Minyatur> I had just reloaded the page, so the authToken should have been correct, I would assume.
11:54 < topolik> ok
12:16 < Tar-Minyatur> Well...disabling the auth token stuff hopefully solves this problem.
12:16 < Tar-Minyatur> And I doubt that we'll have any security problems because of it.
12:16 < Tar-Minyatur> Thanks for your help though.
14:07 < scribe> Good morning guys!
14:07 < Tar-Minyatur> It's evening over here, but I get the idea. Hi. ;)
14:09 < scribe> Tar-Minyatur, :)
14:10 < scribe> So, we've been asking about a new layout which can place portlets on slide in drop targets for a while now.
14:10 < scribe> I spent this weekend and made something along those lines.
14:11 < scribe> I wanna show it off.
14:11 < scribe> anyone wanna see?
14:11 < scribe> :)
14:11 < scribe> http://ntvmr.uni-muenster.de/manuscript-workspace?docid=10001&pageid=10
14:17 < Tar-Minyatur> Not bad. Definitely interesting.
14:19 < scribe> thanks Tar-Minyatur
14:19 < Tar-Minyatur> I think I would prefer a click action to trigger the sliding, to be honest.
14:19 < scribe> yeah, I thought of adding that.
14:19 < Tar-Minyatur> Seems a little...uneasy to me.
14:20 < scribe> yeah, but here is the original page: http://ntvmr.uni-muenster.de/mwc?docid=10001&pageid=10
14:21 < scribe> you have to scroll up and down the page to see all 4 portlets.
14:21 < scribe> sucks.
14:21 < scribe> on the new page, also note the portlets resize when you resize your browser.
14:52 < mvlach> hello
14:52 < mvlach> can somebody help me with OpenEntityManagerInView please ?
15:52 < topolik> hi scribe, that's awesome, I really like it
15:52 < topolik> it would be great if I could pin it so that it stays opened
15:55 < topolik> but I believe it's definitely something to share, if you are allowed to
16:27 < scribe> topolik1, thanks!
16:28 < scribe> topolik1, the problem with pinning is that it doesn't adjust the other gadgets.  Maybe if we pin it, we could adjust the space so the other gadget shrink.
16:29 < topolik1> hmm, sth like windows splitting
16:30 < topolik1> so that it's not floating
16:31 < scribe> gotta run right now.  talk soon.
