04:30 < mls_:#liferay> hi all
04:30 < mls_:#liferay> anyone here with dynamicQuery knowledge ? Can't do it with liferay 6.1
05:13 < mls_:#liferay> anyone here with dynamicQuery knowledge ? Can't do it with liferay 6.1
05:14 < topolik:#liferay> hi mls_, what's the problem?
05:18 < mls_:#liferay> hi
05:18 < mls_:#liferay> #set ($dynamicQuery = $dynamicQueryFactoryUtil.forClass($layoutClass).add($restrictionsFactoryUtil.eq("friendlyURL", $login)))
05:18 < mls_:#liferay> this seems not to work (when I log $dynamicQuery , it returns "$dynamicQuery ")
05:18 < mls_:#liferay> instead of an object tostring
05:19 < mls_:#liferay> I'm on LR6.1, in velocity templates
05:24 < mls_:#liferay> topolik : #set ($dynamicQuery = $dynamicQueryFactoryUtil.forClass($layoutClass).add($restrictionsFactoryUtil.eq("friendlyurl", $login))) is correct ? It should add the restriction "/login" to the "friendlyurl" field, but my result gives me all the friendlyurl I have in db
05:29 < topolik:#liferay> I'm sorry I don't know what may be wrong, but try to isolate the problem
05:29 < topolik:#liferay> what returns $dynamicQueryFactoryUtil ?
05:30 < topolik:#liferay> and $layoutClass and $restrictionsFactoryUtil and $login ?
05:30 < topolik:#liferay> if any of these variables are not defined, it can cause problems
05:32 < mls_:#liferay> topolik well I'm testing (with log) all variables
05:32 < mls_:#liferay> and all refers to instances
05:32 < topolik:#liferay> ok, and does  $dynamicQueryFactoryUtil.forClass($layoutClass) work?
05:32 < mls_:#liferay> $login=/login, $restrictionFU=instance, $layoutClass=class, $dynamicqfu=instance
05:33 < topolik:#liferay> and $restrictionsFactoryUtil.eq("friendlyurl", $login) ?
05:33 < mls_:#liferay> topolik how can I check it works ?
05:33 < topolik:#liferay> etc...
05:33 < topolik:#liferay> I'd just write it into the template and let it execute
05:33 < topolik:#liferay> as it is
05:34 < mls_:#liferay> well $layouts.size() = 15
05:34 < mls_:#liferay> in logs
05:34 < mls_:#liferay> so the query is actually executed, but not with the restriction of friendlyURL.eq("/login")
05:34 < topolik:#liferay> hmm ok
05:34 < topolik:#liferay> so it's not problem in velocity
05:36 < mls_:#liferay> topolik I'm making you a pastebin.com so you can see the code
05:40 < mls_:#liferay> topolik : http://pastebin.com/Yim8PLAP
05:44 < mls_:#liferay> hmmm
05:46 < mls_:#liferay> I have a [BasePersistenceImpl:202] Caught unexpected exception java.lang.NullPointerException in my logs
05:47 < topolik:#liferay> I see it too
05:47 < topolik:#liferay> let's take a look
05:48 < mls_:#liferay> btw, what's the difference with : $portal.getclass().forname or $serviceLocator.findService
05:50 < topolik:#liferay> the serviceLocator finds Spring bean that's registered to that service
05:50 < topolik:#liferay> portal.getclass only loads a class instance
05:50 < mls_:#liferay> can we mix both ?
05:50 < topolik:#liferay> every has own purpose
05:51 < mls_:#liferay> sorry I was confuse. It's ok
05:51 < topolik:#liferay> you should use $serviceLocator to load services
05:51 < mls_:#liferay> but don't know from where this NullPointerException comes
05:53 < mls_:#liferay> fact is I saw a lot of code on internet with $portal.getClass().forName("[package].DynamicQueryFactoryUtil"). When I though it was a service
06:14 < mls_:#liferay> anyone know how to configure logger of liferay to debug level ? I want to debug BasePersistenceImpl.java at a debug level
06:14 < mls_:#liferay> want to pass into that : _log.isDebugEnabled()
06:20 < hufg:#liferay> helloo helloo any ideas what's the purpose of wrapper classes JournalArticle, JournalArticleWrapper, JournalArticleImpl
06:21 < hufg:#liferay> mls_: you can do it from ui
06:21 < mls_:#liferay> just found it yes. thanks
06:40 < topolik:#liferay> mls_
06:41 < topolik:#liferay> mls_: so I think what's the problem
06:41 < topolik:#liferay> the problem is in RestrictionsFactoryUtil
06:41 < topolik:#liferay> this is why there is the NPE
06:42 < topolik:#liferay> portal returns a proxy around instance of RestrictionsFactoryUtil
06:42 < topolik:#liferay> so velocity cannot access static methods of RestrictionsFactoryUtil
06:43 < mls_:#liferay> so what to do to add restrictions ?
06:44 < topolik:#liferay> the only that could work in Liferay 6.1.1 (CE GA2):
06:44 < topolik:#liferay> #set ($layoutLocalService = $serviceLocator.findService("com.liferay.portal.service.LayoutLocalService"))
06:44 < topolik:#liferay> #set ($restrictionsFactoryUtil = $serviceLocator.getClass().forName("com.liferay.portal.kernel.dao.orm.RestrictionsFactoryUtil"))
06:44 < topolik:#liferay> #set ($dq = $layoutLocalService.dynamicQuery().add($restrictionsFactoryUtil.like("friendlyURL", "/home")))
06:44 < topolik:#liferay> #set ($layouts = $layoutLocalService.dynamicQuery($dq))
06:44 < topolik:#liferay> this may not work in later versions
06:46 < topolik:#liferay> ok, works in GA3 too
06:46 < mls_:#liferay> keeping that. need to go to get some lunch. I'll try asap. thanks
07:03 < hufg:#liferay> ajjajjaa topolik no chances you know how i can get groupid from url
07:03 < hufg:#liferay> there may be some api call but the api is vast and thick
07:07 < mls_:#liferay> topolik : why is it now working so ?
07:08 < mls_:#liferay> I saw you instanciate $restrictionFU with getClass().forName() instead of serviceLocator.findService
07:08 < hufg:#liferay> ok ok found it
07:13 < topolik:#liferay> hufg: ok :)
07:13 < topolik:#liferay> mls_: as I wrote, it's because of that proxy
07:14 < mls_:#liferay> so proxy can't access statics methods ?
07:14 < topolik:#liferay> velocity can't access the static methods from proxy
07:14 < topolik:#liferay> velocity supports static methods via class instance
07:14 < Axxell:#liferay> Hey guys, im trying to list document library folders (and eventually files), just cant be able to get the root folder id
07:15 < topolik:#liferay> mls_: but proxy doesn't share the static methods of the wrapped object, it's a different class
07:15 < mls_:#liferay> root folder id is 0
07:16 < topolik:#liferay> mls_:  so reflection can't find the methods using proxy class
07:16 < mls_:#liferay> topolik : it seems ahead of my competences, but thanks for explaining. It works :)
07:16 < topolik:#liferay> haha, ok :)
07:17 < Axxell:#liferay> im trying to use:   rootFolder = DLFolderServiceUtil.getFolder(DLFolderConstants.DEFAULT_PARENT_FOLDER_ID);
07:18 < Axxell:#liferay> but apparantly that goes to hell
07:19 < topolik:#liferay> Axxell: is it possible that there is no root folder?
07:19 < topolik:#liferay> and all folders that are inside this "virtual root folder" just share parentFolderId = DLFolderConstants.DEFAULT_PARENT_FOLDER_ID ?
07:20 < Axxell:#liferay> what i try to do is list folders and files of a site
07:22 < Axxell:#liferay> so you mean to get all folders i just need to do:
07:22 < Axxell:#liferay> subFolders = DLFolderLocalServiceUtil.getFolders(scopedGroupId, DLFolderConstants.DEFAULT_PARENT_FOLDER_ID);
07:22 < Axxell:#liferay> was expecting there to be a root folder
07:23 < topolik:#liferay> I think it returns what you'd call first level
07:23 < Axxell:#liferay> yup as long as it returns something :D
07:24 < Axxell:#liferay> ok, so that was the thing that got my bloodpressure to get sky high
07:24 < Axxell:#liferay> following an example where they try to get the rootfolder
07:25 < Axxell:#liferay> thanks again, topolik
07:25 < topolik:#liferay> y/w :)
08:03 < hufg:#liferay> ahh why is my bean null from PortletBeanLocatorUtil
08:03 < hufg:#liferay> in jsp
08:04 < hufg:#liferay> any ideas how to get an instance of GroupLocalService in jsp?
08:07 < mls_:#liferay> how do you instanciate your PortletBeanLocatorUtil ?
08:17 < mls_:#liferay> #set ($dqFile = $DLFileEntryLocalService.dynamicQuery().add($restrictionsFactoryUtil.eq("title", "my_file_title"))) > when I execute the query, I've got an object with all fields from database, but I can't use $result.getUuid(). Why ?
08:21 < hufg:#liferay> mls_: it's static the "locator" method
08:21 < hufg:#liferay> now i get the bean but not desired result oh well
09:05 < mls_:#liferay> it seems $layoutLocalServiceUtil.dynamicQuery() returns a static dynamicQuery object
09:06 < mls_:#liferay> So everytime i call it I get the same old object with data already inside. I can't do another query with it. How to "reset" it ?
09:07 < jardineworks:#liferay> mls_ ah! I thought I was going nuts yesterday but that might be my problem too. I updated my Journal Article with new values, but they wouldn't show up in my dynamic query
09:08 < mls_:#liferay> jardineworks: did you find a workaround ?
09:08 < jardineworks:#liferay> mls_, It was the end of my day and I just started. I hadn't even thought about the fact that the dynamic query might be cached until you just said it to be honest.
09:10 < mls_:#liferay> jardineworks: I don't know if it's cached or anything, but I'm doing a first dynamicquery with "friendlyURL" = "/login", and when I try later to do another DQ with "friendlyURL" = "/home", the result is "login"... so it's like my second call isn't read
09:10 < mls_:#liferay> topolik any idea ?
09:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> mls_, in my case it is one field on a content item (custom structure) that I changed in the database but does not change on refresh of the portlet. I just read something about disabling the finder cache but that seems a little extreme :)
09:13 < jardineworks:#liferay> I wonder if maybe its layout cache in my case...
09:14 < mls_:#liferay> jardineworks: did you change it from liferay backoffice, or directly from database ?
09:16 < jardineworks:#liferay> in the control panel
09:16 < jardineworks:#liferay> i didn't check the database to see if it was updated... I assumed that it was
09:17 < jardineworks:#liferay> brb gotta reboot
09:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> mls_, did I miss the solution?!
09:53 < mls_:#liferay> I don't have it...
09:53 < jardineworks:#liferay> :(
09:53 < jardineworks:#liferay> oh well, mine is not my first task. If I find anything out later I'll let you know
09:56 < hufg:#liferay> hah just had a grand idea for publishing optimization
09:56 < hufg:#liferay> get the fastest ssd disk on market on mount it on /tmp
10:07 < hufg:#liferay> aargh the 404 and 500 pages are driving me nyts
10:22 < hufg:#liferay> scratch that ssd thing
10:22 < hufg:#liferay> get a proper os and mount tmp on ram disk
10:24 < hufg:#liferay> hell yeah i'll try that soonish
10:27 < dneves:#liferay> hello
10:27 < mls_:#liferay> hi dneves
10:29 < dneves:#liferay> i'm wondering if anyone here can help me with some custom layout i'm implementing for liferay ... i'm writing some html in a velocity template, and somewhere in it there is this line: $processor.processColumn( "$contentId" ). the problem is that the portlets in this layout are in the DOM but now visible (all heights are 0). if i replace "$contentId" for some hard coded string it works (the portlets are visible). anyone know anything about this
10:29 < dneves:#liferay>  ? thanks.
10:36 < jardineworks:#liferay> dneves, are you able to adjust the heights to non-zero in the browser (using firebug or something) to see the content?
10:36 < jardineworks:#liferay> dneves, what do you put for the hard coded string?
10:38 < dneves:#liferay> jardineworks: that line is inside a div that have an id="$contentId". so i thought processColumn would find that div by id (the one i send as the first parameter) and change its contents
10:39 < jardineworks:#liferay> and when you hardcode it, what value do you use?
10:40 < dneves:#liferay> in a 'normal' behaviour, portlets have classes 'portlet-draggable yui3-dd-drop', but mines are getting 'portlet-static portlet-static-end'
10:41 < dneves:#liferay> jardineworks: the same value that $contentId have. any value i put works as long as its the same as the div id. the problem is there when i use the velocity variable inside processColumn
10:41 < jardineworks:#liferay> :|
10:42 < jardineworks:#liferay> dneves, and you have logged the value of $contentId to the console and checked that it is what you expect it to be?
10:42 < dneves:#liferay> as an example, $contentId could be "ontent-section-name", and the div id becomes 'layout-column_content-section-name'
10:43 < dneves:#liferay> jardineworks: dont know how to log to the console (?), but i have <div id="$contentId"> before the processColumn line, and i see the correct value in the DOM
10:45 < dneves:#liferay> with the velocity variable the processColumn line gets the portlets but they are not visible, but with hardcoded columnId parameter they are visible.. :(
10:48 < jardineworks:#liferay> dneves,  #set ($logFactory = $portal.getClass().forName('com.liferay.portal.kernel.log.LogFactoryUtil'))
10:48 < jardineworks:#liferay>  #set ($log = $logFactory.getLog('com.your.whatever.goes.here.PretendClass'))
10:48 < jardineworks:#liferay> then you can do $log.info("ContentID: $contentId")
10:49 < jardineworks:#liferay> and it should show up on your log
10:49 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik, are you still around?
10:49 < dneves:#liferay> ok, will see what it prints
10:50 < jardineworks:#liferay> dneves, Velocity being sinlent with its failures can be really frustrating (my current situation included)
10:52 < topolik:#liferay> jardineworks: partially
10:54 < dneves:#liferay> jardineworks: $log.info( "contentId = '$contentId'" ) prints "contentId = 'content-section-name'" <- what i expected.. the variable value is ok. if i put that value inside processColumn instead of $contentId, it all works :/
11:09 < dneves:#liferay> cant find anything about this on the internet :/
11:19 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik, it's ok.. turns out that Liferay is not stupid, I am :)
11:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> dneves, sorry -- not sure. Does the content for the portlet actually render (but is just not showing in the page?
11:22 < dneves:#liferay> not sure, cant setup the portlet to show anything as its not visible ... anyway, i think i'll do it some other way...
11:22 < dneves:#liferay> jardineworks: thanks for your help
11:31 < jardineworks:#liferay> dneves, I've had issues in the past where the portlet doesn't appear to be visible but using firebug I can see that the content is being rendered. Usually its a CSS issue of some kind and using firebug you can play with it to see if there is an override that is messing you up. Not sure if that is the issue in your case though since it works when you statically input the text.
11:31 < jardineworks:#liferay> wait... try GetterUtil.getString($contentId)
11:31 < jardineworks:#liferay> to force a string value.
11:33 < jardineworks:#liferay> dneves, the util is available using $getterUtil.getString($contentId)
11:39 < dneves:#liferay> jardineworks: same result. i have to do it other way anyway. i have another idea  Thanks :)
14:48 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey guys -- does anyone know how to reference images in the theme from inside a piece of General Web Content?
14:52 < apucay:#liferay> wait, you're embedding web content display in the theme?
14:52 < apucay:#liferay> oh oh, you mean the image is in the theme WAR, not uploaded to liferay
14:53 < jardineworks:#liferay> apucay, I have a page that has some static content so I just created a general web display portlet and cut and paste the source into the code view.
14:53 < jardineworks:#liferay> but the images are not showing...
14:53 < jardineworks:#liferay> the files are not in the documents and media, but they are in the theme
14:53 < jardineworks:#liferay> can I reference them?
14:54 < jardineworks:#liferay> without putting them in documents and media I mean
14:55 < apucay:#liferay> right, i'm trying to think of an api to get you what you want but i think you'll still need to hardcode ther relative path of the image
14:56 < jardineworks:#liferay> i'm fine with hardcoding
14:56 < jardineworks:#liferay> I just don't know the path to the image
14:58 < jardineworks:#liferay> apucay,  do you know what the hardcoded path would be?
14:59 < jardineworks:#liferay> oh - think I got it
15:06 < apucay:#liferay> i was thinking more there is a way to get the theme path, then you hardcode the resource relative to it
15:07 < jardineworks:#liferay> apucay, I don;t think that is possible when making web content. With a custom portlet sure... but in my case I have an RTF box :)
15:08 < jardineworks:#liferay> I suppose if I did a structure I could possibly do it using VM ... but that is overkill for this
15:10 < modd:#liferay> does anyone know where jhf is? berlin?
15:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> modd, I believe sp
15:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> so
15:18 < apucay:#liferay> yeah, i was thinking the structure route
15:19 < jardineworks:#liferay> is it possible to remove the header for a portlet?
15:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> ah
15:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> here we go.
16:56 < Naenyn:#liferay> aw, no rotty.
17:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> Naenyn, berlin.
17:08 < Naenyn:#liferay> jardineworks: how dare he?! =]
17:39 < jardineworks:#liferay> does anyone have a link to a post somewhere that can show my how I can use a search query (lucene) to retrieve a published structure where one of my custom attributes = [something[
18:02 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Somehow I really would like to take an active part in the Liferay community now.
18:03 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> But somehow I can't find the motivation to work on anything when I get home from work...
18:28 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, hah -- i have the opposite problem. I want to do it, but I don't have the TIME to do it.
18:29 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, did you go to the conference again today?
