08:36 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Hey guys...anyone got experience with using CDN in Liferay?
08:37 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Apparently there is a bug that leads to SCSS being retrieved from CDN even when cdn.dynamic.resources.enabled=false is set.
09:36 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, is there an issue reported on jira?
09:37 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, I haven't configured our CDN yet but I will be shortly... this might be something I need to look into as well.
09:44 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I haven't found anything in the issue tracker yet.
09:45 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Our offshore developer suggested to either implement a hook to fix that or to build a new portal-web.war with the capability to deal with SCSS on the fly...or something like that.
09:47 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, I wonder if maybe that property you referenced is colliding, or is dependent or whatever on the localized css property? There is another one for dynamic css... one sec.
09:47 < jardineworks:#liferay> com.liferay.portal.servlet.filters.dynamiccss.DynamicCSSFilter=false
09:49 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Mhm.
09:49 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I guess it's worth a try.
09:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, let me know if that helps at all. Need to know whether or not I need to add something to my list.
09:56 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Hrm. I'm not sure that this would really help.
09:57 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Sounds to me like this would just deactivate some stuff in Liferay if we wanted to deliver the stuff ourselves or something.
09:58 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, I think so, but sometimes these filters get blended... or have unexpected dependencies. It would only take a minute to try it, and you never know!
09:58 < jardineworks:#liferay> :)
10:15 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Oh man. I'm so stupid.
10:15 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I totally forgot that I could also just try it on my local box.
10:15 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I was so involved with setting up the test system over the past days...totally messing with my head.
10:18 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> jardineworks: Deactivating the dynamic css filter doesn't work.
10:18 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> It breaks even more.
10:18 < jardineworks:#liferay> lol
10:19 < jardineworks:#liferay> your welcome. :)
10:19 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> It was worth a try. ;)
10:31 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I'm thinking about a different solution at the moment.
10:32 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Instead of using Liferay's CDN settings, we could use redirects.
10:32 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> In a proxy/webserver that sits in front of Liferay we could bend all paths that point to /img or /images to the CDN.
10:33 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Or something like that.
10:33 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, no doubt that is a common approach -- I think the sort of defacto implementation is to use Apache as a proxy anyway to serve static resources right?
10:33 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I guess so, yes.
10:34 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Although I think I read a study somewhere that Tomcat is faster to deliver static assets than Apache.
10:34 < jardineworks:#liferay> I was telling you that maybe :)
10:34 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> But I think it's a question of configuration.
10:34 < jardineworks:#liferay> I read it in a Tomcat book I have (O'Reilly)
10:34 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Could be, yes. ;)
10:35 < jardineworks:#liferay> but the latest version of apache, being all event driven and stuff now is supposed to be pretty fast
10:37 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> A friend of mine has been configuring Apache for about 12 years now.
10:38 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> He says that you can pretty much achieve any performance goal you wish, if you invest enough time.
10:38 < jardineworks:#liferay> no doubt
10:38 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Optimizing Apache apparently is an art.
10:38 < jardineworks:#liferay> I think most open source is like that right?
10:39 < jardineworks:#liferay> get someone with the right amount of knowlege, give them enough time and money and you can get what you want.
10:39 < jardineworks:#liferay> Life is pretty much like that I suppose :)
10:39 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> True. ;)
11:00 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> jardineworks: Our offshore developer explained his idea about the portal-web.war...his idea was to extract it, run SASS etc. via Maven on it and then upload the result to the CDN.
11:00 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Sounds reasonable to me.
11:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> what do you mean "exteact it"?
11:01 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Well...we have to upload the Liferay stuff to the CDN anyway.
11:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> I don't think so.
11:02 < jardineworks:#liferay> I think if it is working properly, Liferay does it for you doesn't it?
11:02 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Liferay does what?
11:02 < jardineworks:#liferay> I am pretty sure that it handles the synch... you just add the stuff to LR and because you have the CDN configured (at least I thought I read this somewhere) it manages a synched repo or something
11:02 < jardineworks:#liferay> but maybe I have been hanging out with our mayor.
11:02 < jardineworks:#liferay> :)
11:03 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I can't imagine how this should work.
11:03 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> We only specified an URL.
11:03 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> There are not authentication credentials to allow any uploading.
11:03 < jardineworks:#liferay> ... crack it is!
11:03 < jardineworks:#liferay> :)
11:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> oh I know. sorry
11:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> you still reference the paths as if they were local that is what it was
11:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> (I think). I am extremely sleep deprived right now
11:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> so I am making up all sorts of things
11:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> maybe you should just ignore me :)
11:08 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> *lol*
11:15 < jardineworks:#liferay> one sec.
11:15 < jardineworks:#liferay> oops
11:15 < jardineworks:#liferay> so many windows.
11:29 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey tar
11:29 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, do you guys use custom structure on your site?
11:36 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Custom structure?
11:36 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Do you mean web content structures or something else?
11:39 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, custom web content structures maybe? :)
11:40 < jardineworks:#liferay> the ones where you specify the field name/type/search ... and then you create a template (or multiple template) associations
11:40 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Our entire page is built upon these.
11:40 < jardineworks:#liferay> cool
11:40 < jardineworks:#liferay> ok -- so lets say you have structure a
11:40 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Well...a lot of pages only use basic web content and contain a big HTML blog.
11:40 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> *blob
11:41 < jardineworks:#liferay> and it has "Field One" as the name of an element
11:41 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> But we are reworking them to use proper structure-template-combinations.
11:41 < jardineworks:#liferay> do you know what that gets translated to for the template? is it $field-one.data?
11:41 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> You can specify a name and a title for a structure element.
11:41 < jardineworks:#liferay> i mean, you can't reference is as $file one.data
11:42 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> There are two different views to edit structures.
11:42 < jardineworks:#liferay> right, but if you specify the name with a space in it, /....
11:42 < jardineworks:#liferay> eh?
11:42 < jardineworks:#liferay> really?
11:42 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Wenn du go to structure -> edit you can only specify the name.
11:42 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> *When
11:42 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> But when you create an artice and select the structure, you can also edit the structure right there.
11:43 < jardineworks:#liferay> oh right
11:43 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> This interface is much more feature-rich and also allows you to specify a title, tooltip etc. for the fields.
11:43 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Just set a proper technical name for the field and then add a human-readable title as well.
11:43 < jardineworks:#liferay> but I assume that if you don't edit the structure when you are isntantiating the portlet that by default LR must conver the names using some fomula... like fieldName.repace(" ", "-") or soemthing
11:44 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> No idea. We never used spaces in the names. Only in the titles.
11:44 < jardineworks:#liferay> I don't mean the actual values when you create content... I mean the names of the fields when you define the structures.
11:59 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Sure.
12:02 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I never put any spaces there, because for me these are technical names and those should adhere to typical variable name conventions.
12:02 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> There might be some kind of Util to access the fields.
12:02 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Because when you have nested fields you can do things like $parentField.getChildNode('child node') or something.
12:03 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Maybe there is something similar to get the parent node.
12:15 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> But to be honest...the displayed name and the internally used name SHOULD be different.
12:15 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> So no need to use spaces anyway.
12:24 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, I think we're talking about different things. When I create a structure, I add the name of the field right? This is the name that is shown to the user when they are creating content as well, so a "friendly" version would say soemthing like "Promo Title"
12:25 < jardineworks:#liferay> content admin loads the add web content page for the structure and they see Promo Title with a text field.
12:25 < jardineworks:#liferay> now I know that you can modify the template var to call it andrews_promo_title or whatever, but lets say you don't do that.
12:25 < jardineworks:#liferay> surely Promo Title is automatically translated to something that allows you to use it in the template
12:26 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey rotty3000, topolik  are one you around to answer a security question?
12:30 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> jardineworks: We are talking about the same thing. I'm just curious that spaces are even allowed there. They shouldn't be.
12:31 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Switch to 6.2...there you will have a palette with all available variables. :D
12:31 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, well, it does make sense. lets say you have a field called Title.
12:31 < jardineworks:#liferay> if you choose the wrong name you will get an error telling you that name is already in use
12:31 < jardineworks:#liferay> so what I choose to do is prefix every field with the type of the content
12:32 < jardineworks:#liferay> two things this does. 1. eliminates the dupe field name issue. 2. Actually makes it more obvious to a user that is not paying attention what type of content they are creating
12:32 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> That's what titles and tooltips are for.
12:32 < jardineworks:#liferay> the down side.. is the name. I think in 6.0 it did a toLower() and a replace(" ", "-").
12:33 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Maybe you have different users than I do...but our users shut down their brain when they see something that looks technical.
12:33 < jardineworks:#liferay> lol
12:34 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> So our fields have names like "teaser1-img" or "teaser2-image-alt-text" and then there are Titles for both fields that clearly describe what the field is about. And usually there also is a tooltip explaining the kind of values that should be put in.
12:35 < jardineworks:#liferay> what version are you on again?
12:35 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> 6.1.2
12:37 < jardineworks:#liferay> GA3?
12:37 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Yes.
12:37 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> The latest one.
12:37 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I get the feeling that you don't know what I'm talking about.
12:39 < topolik:#liferay> jardineworks: shoot now I'll  answer later :) Just mention me in the message, thx!
12:40 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> jardineworks: Create an empty structure and open the XML editor for it. Than paste this into it: http://pastie.org/private/ylvn3egfqahv3opyehfq - Now have a look at the form when you create an article with this structure.
12:40 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Just to make sure that you actually know what I'm talking about.
12:42 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik, OK thanks. This has to do with that horrible "Forbidden resource" exception that you get sometimes. I am looking at the code and that in conjunction with this post http://www.liferay.com/community/forums/-/message_boards/message/8839061 I think means that its a stale session. If I disable this property -- auth.token.check.enabled=false -- am I asking for trouble?
12:44 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, ah I see.
12:44 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, the "predefinedValue" is the one that I am interested in from a default structure.
12:44 < jardineworks:#liferay> :)
12:45 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> These structures could do with even more usability features, to be honest.
12:45 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> At least for our use cases.
12:45 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> But well...I already introduced a lot of improvements.
12:45 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Because when I started here, nobody knew about tooltips and proper titles.
12:45 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> ;)
12:47 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Oh well. Tomorrow I have to find solutions for this annoying SCSS on CDN problem and for the fact that some idiot hardcoded image paths in CSS.
12:47 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, I think in 6.2 this is an area of the portal that has really been improved. This and the template creation.
12:52 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Sure looked like it on the DevCon....yeah.
12:53 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Still haven't had time to play with 6.2. :(
13:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, me neither. I'm hoping to set a lab up with it over the holidays though
13:12 < topolik:#liferay> jardineworks: yes, when you disable p_auth token you disable whole CSRF protection
13:13 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik, can I pm you to discuss this (for obvious reasons)
13:13 < topolik:#liferay> ok, sure
13:13 < topolik:#liferay> you don't need to ask :)
