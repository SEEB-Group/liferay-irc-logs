16:42 < axiomaticxx:#liferay> is liferay suitable for a public facing website like linked-in? Any example?
16:52 < jardineworks:#liferay> axiomaticxx, I would say so. I am currently using it to build a public facing ecommerce site
16:55 < axiomaticxx:#liferay> I read on the internet that liferay has to be restarted multiple times when the amount of users gets big. Any experience?
16:58 < jardineworks:#liferay> axiomaticxx, what does big equate to? its all relative. And Liferay is software. Sounds to me like a shitty sysadmin that doesn't know how to manage network resources under load.
16:59 < jardineworks:#liferay> I've personally never had an issue with performance
16:59 < jardineworks:#liferay> but I also have never deployed a site the scale of Linked in.
16:59 < jardineworks:#liferay> (on liferay)
17:00 < axiomaticxx:#liferay> Is it true that liferay after a while always throw a ORMexception?
17:01 < axiomaticxx:#liferay> I tried to find out that it is and it is just a normal exception in the liferay api
17:07 < jardineworks:#liferay> axiomaticxx, I've seen it before, but it was a problem with my code not Liferay.
17:07 < jardineworks:#liferay> once I fixed the error (can't recall exactly what it was) ... everything was fine
17:07 < axiomaticxx:#liferay> jardineworks, thx lot. :-)
