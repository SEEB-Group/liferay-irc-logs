01:54 < nikiforo:#liferay> If there is an ability to listen to all social activities in Liferay?
04:02 -!- mode/#liferay [+o rotty3000] by ChanServ
05:08 < bentech4you:#liferay> how can i integrate liferay with active directory
05:19 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Hey guys.
05:20 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Do you know where Liferay stores images that have been uploaded via a "Image Upload" field in a web content structure?
05:21 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I'm asking, because the URL is different from images uploaded to the documents & media library. It uses /image/ rather than /documents/ and I wonder if the image uploader uses the DL nonetheless.
05:21 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I assume it does, but I would prefer knowing.
05:31 < bentech4you:#liferay> anyone please help me to integrate my liferay with active directory
06:14 < hufg:#liferay> bentech4you: http://www.opensourceforlife.com/2012/05/liferay-61-ldap-config-from-portal.html
06:14 < hufg:#liferay> maybe that helkp
06:14 < hufg:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur: no idea, tell me if you know 8)
06:15 < hufg:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur: get the struts path to retrieve images, see struts-config.xml, check implementation of configured class
06:16 < hufg:#liferay> what is the struts path?
06:17 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I vaguely remember that I already tried looking it up.
06:17 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I'll grab a full path. One sec.
06:18 < hufg:#liferay> could you paste it here?
06:19 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Habve to boot my test system first.
06:19 < hufg:#liferay> i think a long time ago we made a convention to use dl only
06:19 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Hadn't had time to do anything there this week yet.
06:19 < hufg:#liferay> do you use some structure to enable image upload?
06:19 < hufg:#liferay> it's so long ago can't remember
06:21 < hufg:#liferay> ah image_uploader
06:22 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> The path looks like this: /image/journal/article?img_id=2535409&t=1386069661840
06:22 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> And I can't find /image/ in struts-config.xml
06:23 < hufg:#liferay> mm true
06:25 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I would greatly prefer the image uploader, because we often have assets that are relevant for only one page.
06:25 < hufg:#liferay> com.liferay.portal.webserver.WebServerServlet
06:26 < hufg:#liferay> that's the servlet sitting there
06:30 < hufg:#liferay> FileEntry fileEntry = DLAppServiceUtil.getFileEntryByUuidAndGroupId( 							uuid, groupId);
06:30 < hufg:#liferay> that is your image
06:32 < hufg:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur: https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/blob/6.1.1-ga2/portal-impl/src/com/liferay/portal/webserver/WebServerServlet.java#L251
06:32 < hufg:#liferay> there
06:32 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Argh. Next meeting. I'll take a look later. Thanks!
06:37 < hufg:#liferay> woops i was a bit hasty but the answer is there
06:39 < hufg:#liferay> https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/blob/6.1.1-ga2/portal-impl/src/com/liferay/portal/webserver/WebServerServlet.java#L384
06:40 < hufg:#liferay> that is the actual retrieval
06:44 < hufg:#liferay> uhuh
06:45 < hufg:#liferay> not sure but i'd put my money on IMAGE table on db and TEXT column
06:45 < hufg:#liferay> naming the image as text is a bit schizophrenic but at a glance it may be it
06:45 < hufg:#liferay> https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/blob/6.1.1-ga2/portal-impl/src/com/liferay/portal/webserver/WebServerServlet.java#L427
06:46 < hufg:#liferay> i need to do some actual work now hehe
07:49 < vsingleton:#liferay> liferay forums are responding very slowly right now ... anyone else seeing that?
07:50 < vsingleton:#liferay> sometimes im also getting "This webpage is not available"
08:24 < vsingleton:#liferay> still really slow
08:29 < vsingleton:#liferay> wiki is also slow ... looks like it is all of the community pages ...
09:00 < vsingleton:#liferay> still painfully slow pages on liferay.com ... anyone else noticing this
09:06 < hufg:#liferay> relax man
09:07 < Azrae|:#liferay> Anyone here have any experience wrapping up some working self-contained PHP pages into a liferay portlet? I've managed to deploy some but it fails as soon as it hits the first standard php function.
09:08 < Azrae|:#liferay> Does liferay not have 'normal' php libraries?
09:08 < hufg:#liferay> are you building an.... ABOMINATION?
09:08 < Azrae|:#liferay> yes :)
09:08 < hufg:#liferay> herecy!!!
09:10 < Azrae|:#liferay> I have existing php code I want to present within liferay as part of a demo, and also to rapidly provide functionality before our serious java portlet developers replace them. Only internal consumption, outside world will never see the satanic spawn of ickyness
09:10 < hufg:#liferay> hehe
09:11 < hufg:#liferay> i didn't understand
09:11 < hufg:#liferay> you have a java portlet and you want to embed php pages there ?
09:11 < Azrae|:#liferay> well.. currently noone will ever see it if it doesn't work :/
09:11 < hufg:#liferay> or you want to create php portlets and use them
09:11 < Azrae|:#liferay> No, I have some php pages, I zip them up and deploy in liferay, and it becomes a usable application
09:11 < hufg:#liferay> yes so you want php portlets
09:12 < Azrae|:#liferay> ok, yes :)
09:12 < hufg:#liferay> have no clue i just have seen some documentation etc that it should be possible 8)
09:12 < Azrae|:#liferay> ditto
09:12 < hufg:#liferay> http://www.liferay.com/community/wiki/-/wiki/Main/PHP+Portlets
09:12 < Azrae|:#liferay> and, have deployed one, and it worked (installed and lets me add to a page)
09:12 < hufg:#liferay> 8)
09:13 < hufg:#liferay> hehe ok
09:13 < Azrae|:#liferay> yeah, been there, seen that :D
09:13 < hufg:#liferay> hehe
09:13 < hufg:#liferay> i'd be somewhat amazed if it actually works...php portlets
09:14 < Azrae|:#liferay> but the first php function my code hits, throws an error 'Fatal Error: 'ldap_connect' is an unknown function.'
09:14 < Azrae|:#liferay> googling shows a few others with similar errors, but no solutions or answers
09:14 < hufg:#liferay> there is a sample portlet https://github.com/liferay/liferay-plugins/tree/master/portlets/sample-php-portlet
09:14 < hufg:#liferay> have you checked it out?
09:15 < Azrae|:#liferay> looked it over, but not sure if it helps.
09:16 < Azrae|:#liferay> Was hoping someone here had done/seen such things before and would know if standard php functions are supposed to work, if I need to import in some php libraries, or something..
09:20 < Azrae|:#liferay> maybe I need to read up http://wiki.apache.org/tomcat/UsingPhp
09:20 < Azrae|:#liferay> could be unrelated to liferay
09:25 < aj_:#liferay> does anyone know how to use a language key in a web content template?
09:32 < hufg:#liferay> hmm?
09:33 < hufg:#liferay> javascript
09:34 < hufg:#liferay> there is a filter that will make retrieval of language keys with js a server side operation
09:34 < hufg:#liferay> in case you care hehe
09:38 < aj_:#liferay> hufg,  the theme has a macro function... #language -- which I think is linked to the $languageUtil variable... I was just wondering if the templates in web content did the sma thing. I supposed I could load it into my own var... I was just being lazy :)
09:39 < hufg:#liferay> yeah there may be a more correct way to do this
09:39 < hufg:#liferay> i wonder if you can use the premade macros in templates
09:39 < hufg:#liferay> it's a really zz pzz to track down the functionality of templates/velocity
09:40 < hufg:#liferay> theme is somewhat easy
09:42 < hufg:#liferay> forums suggest $languageUtil.get($locale, "key")
09:53 < hufg:#liferay> someone from liferay coerce someone to make a blog post about optimizing publishing with /tmp optimization srsly like tmpfs vs ram disk vs ssd vs hd srsly someone do this srsly 8)
09:53 < hufg:#liferay> srsly?=
09:54 < hufg:#liferay> i can tell you that tmpfs is a serious speed improvement but it will die after a few publishings in ubuntu
09:55 < hufg:#liferay> this would also speed up lucene reindexing
09:57 < hufg:#liferay> rotty3000: let's do this!
10:28 < aj_:#liferay> hufg,  looks like the #language macro works in the web content templates.
10:28 < hufg:#liferay> cuul
10:29 < aj_:#liferay> i still wish I knew why that silly recipe query string wasn't working.
