06:51 < hufg:#liferay> is domain startup time any indicator of performance? 8)
06:51 < hufg:#liferay> i guess it can't be said that it is but still makes me wonder
08:18 < hufg:#liferay> alloyui is raising my blood pressure, first time i'm trying to do something with it
08:18 < hufg:#liferay> it happened like in 5min
08:18 < hufg:#liferay> :d
08:47 < jardineworks_:#liferay> +1 hufg
08:47 < jardineworks_:#liferay> I love it and I hate it all at the same time
08:47 < jardineworks_:#liferay> are you using the js or the taglibs?
09:09 < hufg:#liferay> js
09:10 < hufg:#liferay> well a bit of both
10:46 < dblessing:#liferay> taglibs ftw - assuming they exist for that particular feature. otherwise it's a crap shoot
11:13 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Hi guys.
11:13 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Is there an easy way to clear the search index?
11:14 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> It appears to be stale...it still finds pages for web content that has been deleted ages ago...
11:14 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Well...no clear, but rebuild.
11:14 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> *not
11:19 < jardineworks_:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur,
11:19 < jardineworks_:#liferay> control panel > Server Administration
11:19 < jardineworks_:#liferay> there is a re-index button there
11:20 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Much too obvious. *lol* Thanks.
11:23 < jardineworks_:#liferay> np
11:23 < jardineworks_:#liferay> there are a lot of buttons :)
11:23 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I must say...modifying existing portlets with hooks is much more annoying than writing new portlets...
11:24 < jardineworks_:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, depends on the portlets.
11:24 < jardineworks_:#liferay> I've done a few for this project that if I were to try to reproduce the entire functionality would be a HUGE PITA.
11:25 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Yes. And I assume it's again a matter of our very annoying circumstances.
11:25 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Great. The Reindexing just yielded a 500.
11:25 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> :-/
11:26 < jardineworks_:#liferay> usually a nasty ass stack trace that will accompany that :)
11:28 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Nope. Looks like this is only from the Apache that acts as proxy.
11:28 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> According to the output the server is still reindxing.
11:28 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> 16:27:50,938 INFO  [ajp-bio-8011-exec-1][LuceneIndexer:130] Reindexing Lucene completed in 481 seconds
11:28 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Mhm.
11:29 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Somehow this didn't have any effect at all. Damn.
11:29 < jardineworks_:#liferay> dump the apache front ender.
11:29 < jardineworks_:#liferay> totally don't need it
11:29 < jardineworks_:#liferay> that's a 1999 architecture ;)
11:29 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> The project doesn't work without it.
11:29 < jardineworks_:#liferay> according to my O'Reilly Tomcat book ... benchmarking shows that Tomcat actually serves static content faster than Apache.
11:30 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Too many weird redirects, mappings and proxy rule stuff.
11:30 < jardineworks_:#liferay> and if you REALLY want to improve static content loading, you should be using a CDN anyway right?
11:30 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> We're loading all our assets from an S3 bucket.
11:31 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Our audience is only people in Germany, so a true CDN wouldn't help. ;)
11:32 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> This is really weird. The web content search finds two hits.
11:32 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> The pages the hits lead to, still exist...but the web content doesn't any more.
11:40 < jardineworks_:#liferay> what do you see when you go to the pages?
11:40 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Web content display portlets that state the web content doesn't exist any more.
11:41 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> (We have quite a few of these orphaned pages, because there is some issue with deleting pages.)
11:45 < hufg:#liferay> perhaps delete lucene index
11:45 < hufg:#liferay> don't try it in prod first lol
11:46 < hufg:#liferay> there is a property to reindex it on startup
11:46 < hufg:#liferay> the documentation advices against enabling it in prod
11:46 < hufg:#liferay> we have it enabled though
11:46 < jardineworks_:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, that sounds to me like the state is correct. You have a Layout (Page) and that page has portlet instances on it that need to be configured. Why can't you delete the pages?
11:47 < jardineworks_:#liferay> hufg, I think the only reason they advise against is for performance reasons no?
11:47 < hufg:#liferay> yes
11:47 < hufg:#liferay> it takes a bit more time to start the domain
11:48 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> jardineworks_: But I searched for keywords that existed in the web content that doesn't exist any more.
11:48 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> So there should not be any hits.
11:48 < hufg:#liferay> do you have clustered env?
11:48 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Locally? No.
11:48 < hufg:#liferay> mm
11:48 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Currently experimenting with this on my local box.
11:50 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> jardineworks_: At some point somebody removed the "delete missing pages" from the publishing dialog, because it "caused some issues"
11:50 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> The system has been up for almost a year with weekly updates.
11:51 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> The pages are deleted in staging, but triggering deletion on live was impossible.
11:53 < hufg:#liferay> :-D
11:53 < hufg:#liferay> what was the issue?
11:54 < hufg:#liferay> in 6.1 ga2 you can delete everything else except selected page with it
11:54 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> No clue.
11:54 < hufg:#liferay> hilarious bug
11:56 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> *lol*
11:56 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> It deleted the homepage.
11:56 < hufg:#liferay> do you have some kind of selection of pages with it?
11:56 < hufg:#liferay> perhaps it's the same bug
11:57 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I published a single page and activated "delete missing pages" as well.
11:57 < hufg:#liferay> yes that's exactly the issue
11:57 < hufg:#liferay> do not select the single page
11:58 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I vaguely recall that I got an error message once when I tried publishing with no page selected an only the delete option checked.
11:58 < hufg:#liferay> well you can try it in 30sec right? 8)
11:58 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Once I republished Home...yes. ;)
11:59 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> *lol*
11:59 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I just saw for the first time that you can actually unpublish pages.
12:00 < hufg:#liferay> someone should know why it got removed  right? :D
12:00 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I really should not listen to the rumors about Liferay that are travelling the office
12:00 < hufg:#liferay> how is the dialog removed with hook or some sickening direct edit ?
12:00 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> The original developers are not available any more.
12:00 < hufg:#liferay> yes but some commit message whatever
12:00 < hufg:#liferay> somewher
12:00 < hufg:#liferay> e
12:00 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Nope. Nothing.
12:00 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> No ticket either.
12:01 < hufg:#liferay> direct edit of jsp then?
12:01 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Sure. One of our highly loved core hacks.
12:03 < hufg:#liferay> :D
12:03 < hufg:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur: when i started here there was this mythical aura surrounding liferay
12:03 < hufg:#liferay> no one got shit done and only 100% bitching
12:03 < hufg:#liferay> mythical aura of bullshit
12:04 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Yeah. People here are alyways telling everybody who would listen how shitty Liferay is...
12:04 < hufg:#liferay> hehe exactly the same here
12:04 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> They have no technical background so they assume...page broken? Liferay's fault.
12:05 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> It seems to be a major issue with Liferay that there are A LOT of projects where it's just setup totally wrong.
12:05 < hufg:#liferay> yeah but someone starts that bullshit
12:06 < hufg:#liferay> some 1.5 years ago me and the lead dev said every one stops bitching about liferay right now and relax
12:06 < hufg:#liferay> it has worked
12:08 < hufg:#liferay> even though liferay is hard at times and shit just doesn't work but we have resolved every single issue encountered
12:09 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I hope people will change their attitude when we go live with our replacement system in December.
12:09 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Most of our current issues should be solved in the new setup.
12:09 < hufg:#liferay> naah people change the attitude
12:09 < hufg:#liferay> if it's not stellar i doubt much happens if someone doesn't push into other direction
12:09 < hufg:#liferay> ie. the culture lives on
12:09 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> The problem is that I don't really have a team to solve problems.
12:09 < hufg:#liferay> once established no matter the truth
12:09 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> It's only me.
12:10 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> And three offshore developers.
12:10 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> They chose to use Liferay to avoid needing developers all the time.
12:10 < hufg:#liferay> hehe
12:11 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> All they managed by setting it up in this totally messed up way is that now they need developers even for the smallest content changes.
12:11 < hufg:#liferay> hehe nice
12:11 < hufg:#liferay> our biggest problem is infrastructure
12:11 < hufg:#liferay> those dudes just can't deliver
12:12 < hufg:#liferay> 6months behind schedule and no one knows how infrastructure+liferay actually work
12:12 < hufg:#liferay> works
12:12 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> We have a very enthusiastic sys admin.
12:12 < hufg:#liferay> this late into the project any major hurdle after setting it up is instant delay in launch date
12:12 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> He's currently digging deep into AWS.
12:13 < hufg:#liferay> there is some hilarious problem with quartz that brings down the whole cluster
12:13 < hufg:#liferay> i hope that doesn't happen too often
12:13 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> We have a dedicated instance that runs quartz jobs.
12:14 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> It's not one of the nodes that actually deliver content.
12:14 < hufg:#liferay> something goes wrong somewhere in quartz and all liferay instances die...
12:14 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Sounds odd.
12:16 < hufg:#liferay> hmh ok not all just some nodes
12:22 < hufg:#liferay> how do you handle different env configurations?
12:22 < hufg:#liferay> we have this hilarious maven project with 73  pom files but it works great once you get the hang of it
12:22 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> With separate builds.
12:22 < hufg:#liferay> 8)
12:22 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> We have an admin-instance.properties override.
12:23 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> It's only included in one of the builds.
12:23 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> And for local setups every developer defines his own override.
12:23 < hufg:#liferay> hehe ok
12:23 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Not ideal, but it works.
12:24 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Our offshore developers set up a great Maven build with a very clear project structure.
12:25 < hufg:#liferay> mmh it's very doable with filters and assembly plugin but not that pretty
12:26 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Well...we decided to keep everything in one module as long as it's related.
12:26 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> And we had only a few days to get the project set up.
12:26 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> No time for anything more fancy.
12:26 < hufg:#liferay> 8)
12:28 < hufg:#liferay> ok off to weekend bye!
12:28 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Bye. :)

16:21 < jardineworks_:#liferay> does anyone know if it is possible to pass a value OUT of an Authenticator?
16:45 < jardineworks_:#liferay> hey rotty3000 are you around for a quick security question?
