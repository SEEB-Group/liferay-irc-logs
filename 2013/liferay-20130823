04:15 < Axxell_:#liferay> hey guys, still trying to get the Active Directory nested group thing to work with the following: ldap.group.mappings=groupName=cn\ndescription=description\nuser=member:1.2.840.113556.1.4.1941:
04:16 < Axxell_:#liferay> it doesnt seem to work, is there something wrong with the syntax?
04:28 < Axxell_:#liferay> i can even test it with the ldap settings page in the control panel.. if i just use "member" i get users that are part of that group
04:29 < Axxell_:#liferay> if i use "member:1.2.840.113556.1.4.1941:" none of them has any members
04:38 < Axxell_:#liferay> btw i get a strange error on startup: java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: portal-impl/com/liferay/portal/service/impl/CompanyServiceImpl (wrong name: com/liferay/portal/service/impl/CompanyServiceImpl)
04:43 < Axxell_:#liferay> and now it doesnt even start the ldap import process at all,
05:46 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Hi guys. Does anybody know how I can get the path to an image that has been uploaded via a file upload field in a DDL record?
05:47 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Inside a DDL template I mean. I can get the image, but there is no path in there. Only the name, the class, the PK etc. Do I really have to assemble the image path myself?
05:58 < RajeshK:#liferay> #Users
05:59 < RajeshK:#liferay> pardon my irc skill
06:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> does anyone in here know if it is possible to add your own properties to the portal-ext.properties file?
06:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> I mean, I have found posts from people who say that you can but I am curious as to what type of plugin they used -- ext?
09:58 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> jardineworks: We have quite a lot of custom properties in our application.
09:58 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> It shouldn't matter which kind of plugin you use, because you can modify settings from hooks as well as from ext plugins.
10:01 < topolik:#liferay> jardineworks: Tar-Minyatur: IMHO only ext allows new properties
10:02 < topolik:#liferay> hook changes PropsValues -> it can only change what's already defined
10:02 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Mhm.
10:03 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Oh yeah. Right. Dang.
10:03 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> There is a list of properties you can change in a hook.
10:03 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I remember now.
10:08 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik, Tar-Minyatur I used PrefsPropsUtil.getString("key");
10:10 < topolik:#liferay> uhmmmm, interesting
10:10 < topolik:#liferay> this could work!
10:11 < topolik:#liferay> but you need to add the property into database, not into .properties file
10:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik, nope... I just put it in the portal-ext.properites and its working :)
10:12 < topolik:#liferay> ok, then I misunderstood your question :)
10:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> lol
10:12 < topolik:#liferay> anyway, I'm glad it's working ;)
10:14 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik, the goal for me was to be able to set client.api.server.host and client.api.server.port and client.api.sever.secure ... properties in a portal-ext.[environment].properties so that I don't have to change it with each build.
10:14 < topolik:#liferay> ok, I thought you need a plugin to set it
10:15 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik, I thought so too... maybe new in 6.1?
10:16 < topolik:#liferay> I didn't see any such improvement in 6.2
10:16 < topolik:#liferay> but, anything is possible: https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/blob/master/portal-web/test/functional/com/liferay/portalweb/selenium/dependencies/Cat.jpg :D
10:17 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> ;)
10:17 < jardineworks:#liferay> haha
10:17 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Guys...is it possible to create custom entities and leverage Liferay's infrastructure for retrieving and storing them in the database?
10:18 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I'm assembling a list of possible replacements for our messed up DDL data storage nightmare...and it's very clearly structured data...so the most obvious thing seems to be a relational database table...
10:19 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, you mean like service builder/
10:19 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I mean like having a MyDataThingy class and some way of retrieving instances of that from the database and for storing them there in the first place.
10:20 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> No clue how that works in Liferay, to be honest.
10:21 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> But all the ORM stuff or whatever Liferay is using is already there...so setting up another stack seems like a dumb idea. Can I use Liferay's with my own stuff somehow?
10:21 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> (Wow...my explanations get worse and worse when it goes toward the weekend...)
10:22 < jardineworks:#liferay> the reason I fell in love with Liferay -- this and hot deployments. http://www.liferay.com/community/wiki/-/wiki/Main/Service+Builder
10:23 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> That looks _interesting_.
10:24 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> So I could easily set up my own Entity and then write a Portlet to show and modify this data, right?
10:25 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Definitely a possible solution.
10:25 < jardineworks:#liferay> you can do just taht in about 15 minutes
10:26 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> One requirement is that we need a JSON interface as well to retrieve the data (not to manipulate it). I guess the drawback of this approach would be that this would have to be created manually or is there an automatism for that as well? Because Liferay has this great JSON interface stuff built in already.
10:27 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> If we were to store all this information in separate journal articles, we could leverage the existing interface to retrieve articles as JSON.
10:27 < jardineworks:#liferay> in your xml definition make sure you set remote="true" for the entity
10:27 < jardineworks:#liferay> it will generate REST/SOAP/JSON services for you as well
10:27 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Oh nice. Oo
10:27 < jardineworks:#liferay> I <3 LR
10:28 < jardineworks:#liferay> I tell all my clients the same thing. It's not that LR can't do it... it's just that you don't know how yet :)
10:29 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Exactly.
10:30 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> That's what we are dealing with right now.
10:30 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> We committed yesterday to finding solutions to do everything we need with Liferay-Features so we can get rid of the customized core.
10:31 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> And if we encounter something Liferay actually can't do the way we want, we build Plugins, not hack the core...
10:31 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Btw...do you mind if I ask you about some other features we need? Maybe you already know of a way to do this with Liferay.
10:36 < jardineworks:#liferay> shoot
10:36 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Great. Thanks.
10:36 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> We're working with a responsive design. So for every image there are several versions (different resolutions).
10:37 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> They built a custom image uploader which automatically creates smaller versions of uploaded images. (Standalone...not integrated with the DL.)
10:37 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Any way to get this done with Liferay? Is the autoscaling feature (appending &width=... to the URL) worth anything? (Can't test it right now, because it doesn't work in our Liferay version.)
10:41 < jardineworks:#liferay> hmmm -- I haven't done anything responsive with Liferay (though the project I am on now will be responsive -- just haven't got there yet).
10:42 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Right now we have three versions of every image and they are identified by having the width in the filename.
10:42 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, You could write a Wrapper class for the *LocalService util that is used to upload the images and override the save logic to include your code to generate the versions
10:42 < jardineworks:#liferay> ... bascially you provide your own bustom version.
10:42 < jardineworks:#liferay> custom*
10:42 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Mhm. That would probably a more complex modification.
10:43 < jardineworks:#liferay> and in the same wrapper, for the retrieval method, override the logic so that you append the width to the name.
10:43 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Because sometimes there are special versions of the smaller images.
10:43 < jardineworks:#liferay> actually, it's not that bad.
10:43 < jardineworks:#liferay> it's just a service hook.
10:43 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> We could make it so that the versions are only created if they are not already present.
10:43 < jardineworks:#liferay> voila -- http://www.liferay.com/documentation/liferay-portal/6.0/development/-/ai/overriding-a-portal-service
10:44 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> So the content guys could always upload other images, if they have special wished for the smaller versions.
10:44 < jardineworks:#liferay> sure -- or add a JSP hook that adds another button. Leave the original button as is and hook the new one up to the "Save Iamge and Generate Sizes" or something.
10:45 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Sounds reasonable.
10:46 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Although I'd love to use that image autoscaling.
10:46 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Shouldn't make much of a difference whether we change foo_500.png to foo_100.png or add a ?width=100 to the original URL.
10:47 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Mhm mhm. So many options.
10:48 < jardineworks:#liferay> you can still use the auto scaler.
10:48 < jardineworks:#liferay> it's code that calculates the new sizes and generates them right?
10:49 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I guess so.
10:49 < jardineworks:#liferay> just make sure that the JARs are in your hook and in the method you override you cut and paste the code to generate the images :)
10:49 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> (I mean the stuff built into Liferay.)
10:54 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Oh...btw...concerning the Entities again...is it be possible to hook custom entities to the publishing processes of Liferay somehow?
10:54 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Or would I have to create my own implementation to get staging for changes to those entities?
10:57 < jardineworks:#liferay> one sec..
11:00 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, Not sure to be honest. Worst case scenario you can create an EXT plugin and define your own custom logic for the class that handles it. Having said that, if there is a service or action that you can hook though, that would be the better approach. Might have to dig through the source a bit to figure that out.
11:00 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I guess so...yeah.
11:00 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Would be nice if a portlet could react to a "publish" event.
11:01 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Because basically all the content from the entities would be embedded on pages using my portlet.
11:05 < rochadt:#liferay> oops :/
11:05 < rochadt:#liferay> oops :/
11:28 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, I portlet might be able to react to a publish event.
11:29 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, you could create a Publish event, create a wrapper so that the "Publish Action" would generate the event and put it on the bus and then tell your portlet to listen for it (I think anyway)
11:30 < jardineworks:#liferay> I know you can define your own events
11:30 < jardineworks:#liferay> and that listeners can register for notifications
11:30 < jardineworks:#liferay> sorry -- models can register listeners for notifications.
11:31 < jardineworks:#liferay> I remember reading about it
11:32 < jardineworks:#liferay> There is a JournalArticleListener
11:33 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, I would maybe dig through the WF flow since I am sure that there is something in there that can lead you to a similar solution. No doubt that WF Actions generate events that listeners pick up and handle.
11:34 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, Worst case scenario... if the portlets were on the same page, yyou can override the JSP with a hook and add in some AUI liferay.on event code ... make the publish button fire it, and make your portlet listen for it.
11:44 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> jardineworks: Sounds good. Thanks for the ideas.
13:39 <@jhf:#liferay> for those of you who entered the marketplace app contest - we are delaying the announcement for a week, because we got too many dang entries!!
13:39 <@jhf:#liferay> re: bijoo and maybe others
13:40 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, what's the prize?
13:41 <@jhf:#liferay> grand prize is a paid-for trip to any LR conference in the world (airfare + hotel) and some other goodies at the event
13:41 <@jhf:#liferay> runners-up get iPads
13:41 <@jhf:#liferay> err
13:41 <@jhf:#liferay> iPad Minis
13:47 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, what is the coolest location hosting a conference?
13:57 < LRAdminInNeed40:#liferay> hello!
13:58 <@jhf:#liferay> jardineworks: hmm
13:58 <@jhf:#liferay> you mean of the existing LR conferences?
13:58 <@jhf:#liferay> or just my personal favorite location
13:58 <@jhf:#liferay> hey LRAdminInNeed40
13:58 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, lets say ... upcoming and yours
13:59 <@jhf:#liferay> hmmmmmmm
14:00 <@jhf:#liferay> I guess I'd have to say florence, italy
14:00 <@jhf:#liferay> but berlin is a close 2nd
14:07 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf was that your favourite? or an up and coming>
15:02 <@jhf:#liferay> jardineworks: sorry, stepped away.
15:02 <@jhf:#liferay> that's the coolest city of all of the cities we have upcoming events in
15:03 <@jhf:#liferay> the best "bang for your buck" for EU is Berlin, NA is San Francisco
15:03 <@jhf:#liferay> unless you're a business guy
15:03 <@jhf:#liferay> then you want to go to Frankfurt
15:03 <@jhf:#liferay> or London
15:03 <@jhf:#liferay> but Florence is an amazing city.
15:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, Liferay ever going to head north of the border?
15:11 <@jhf:#liferay> canada? nothing planned, but you never know.  We could do an ice fishing contest.
15:15 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, I like drinking contests more :)
15:15 < jardineworks:#liferay> or I used to
15:15 < jardineworks:#liferay> I'm to old for the sh*t now
15:15 < jardineworks:#liferay> :)
15:15 < jardineworks:#liferay> though ice fishing, from what I understand is pretty much a drinking competition
15:16 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah exactly
15:16 <@jhf:#liferay> Québécois need not apply!
15:16 <@jhf:#liferay> right rotty3000 ?
15:17 < jardineworks:#liferay> Vive la maudite!
15:17 < jardineworks:#liferay> or Fin du Monde
15:17 < jardineworks:#liferay> best. beers. ever.
15:19 < LRAdminInNeed148:#liferay> LRAdminInNeed40, still there?
15:26 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, is there an easy way to convert MyEntityClp to MyEntity?
15:27 <@jhf:#liferay> that I do not know, you've reached the end of my abilities (actually went quite a bit past them :) )
15:30 < jardineworks:#liferay> lol
15:31 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf -- I wrote a hook that shoves one of my entities into the velocity variables. I now have another hook that is doing some custom registration nad I pull the value out of the WebKeys.VM_VARIABLES... but the type os ApiKeyClp, not ApiKey :(
15:31 < jardineworks:#liferay> which makes sense sinmce you need to serialize it for the request... but there must be a way to get it back!
15:32 < jardineworks:#liferay> AHA!
15:32 < jardineworks:#liferay> ClpSerializer
16:24 < LRAdminInNeed116:#liferay> Testing an IRC portlet (you can ignore me)
16:24 < barrie:#liferay> OK
16:24 <@jhf:#liferay> barrie!!!!!
16:25 <@jhf:#liferay> hey wait
16:25 < barrie:#liferay> :-)
16:25 <@jhf:#liferay> is THAT where LRAdminInNeed people come from
16:25 <@jhf:#liferay> that marketplace app?
16:25 <@jhf:#liferay> hahahaha.. mystery solved!
16:25 < barrie:#liferay> seems so
16:25 < barrie:#liferay> would be nice if I could configure it for my id
17:24 <@jhf:#liferay> hey everyone - 6.1 CE GA3 was just released! http://www.liferay.com/web/james.falkner/blog/-/blogs/new-release-liferay-portal-6-1-ce-ga3
