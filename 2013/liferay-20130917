09:43 < jardineworks:#liferay> good morning
09:50 < jardineworks:#liferay> who's the service builder guru in house? topolik? you?
09:51 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> The Liferay world needs more ServiceBuilder gurus!
09:52 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, I am contemplating soemthing that might be dangerous... I need an expert to tell me if I have lost it :)
09:53 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> ;)
09:53 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I could really use a Liferay expert full time here...
09:53 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> So I could bounce my ideas off of someone and see if I'm totally on the wrong track...
09:53 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, where are you located again?
09:54 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Germany.
09:54 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> And sadly I'm not in a position to hire someone.
09:55 < jardineworks:#liferay> haha
09:55 < jardineworks:#liferay> always the same. Those who actually KNOW what they need are rarely in the position to hire.
09:55 < jardineworks:#liferay> only to plead with the guys holding the bag with the money sign on it
10:00 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Well...the problem is that there hardly is any budget.
10:00 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Because the project already has been paid for and afterwards they realized that it's a huge mess.
10:01 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Right now it looks like they actually might allow us to build it from scratch again, which will be expensive enough as it is...
10:02 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Anyway...I'm still messing around with ServiceBuilder.
10:02 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I actually got it to work now.
10:02 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> At least it looks like it.
10:02 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I managed to build a view for one of the entities with the search-container as you suggested. Works nicely.
10:03 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Then I moved on to adding a new entity. Can I ask you some (probably minor) questions about that or are you swarmed (or too bored by this already :D)?
10:04 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Adding a new entry I mean...not entity. Jikes.
10:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> i'm always lurking here... fire away
10:38 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> jardineworks: Okay. When I first tried to use my add entry form, I got an error on the second submit, because ID 0 was already used.
10:39 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Is there something that would suggest not to create a custom addEntry method that retrieves a new ID?
10:41 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> And I also saw that Liferay doesn't automatically deal with modifiedDate and endDate even though they were advertised in the documentation as "audit fields".
10:45 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> So right now what I did is this: http://pastie.org/private/ej7bsskhhtsny8q6u9u6w
10:45 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Is there a better way to do it or a reason not to do it this way?
10:58 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, that works, though I don't think you need to override the add functionality from the super class. All I normally is create the instance (as you are doing) but in the portlet, and the call the add function on the *LocalServiceUtil.
10:58 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Then I would have to fetch the next ID within the portlet.
10:58 < jardineworks:#liferay> the *LocalServiceUtil also provides a create method so, as an exmaple using user, you can do..
10:59 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> The create Method also wants to have an ID.
10:59 < jardineworks:#liferay> User user = UserLocalServiceUtile.create( CounterLocalServiceUtil.increment( User.class.getName() ) );
10:59 < jardineworks:#liferay> and then user.set( ...) ... including what you are doing for the dates
10:59 < jardineworks:#liferay> and then UserLocalServiceUtil.add( user );
11:00 < jardineworks:#liferay> add is provided for you basically. You should only override it if you need to do something special as part of your "saves"
11:01 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I guess changing the "normal" way is bad.
11:01 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> So I guess I'll do it your way.
11:02 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I have only one place in total where new entries are created, so I guess it's ok.
11:03 < jardineworks:#liferay> I don't know if my way is the "best" way or not... but it makes sense to me. The purpose of your portlet is to add a product right? you collect all the information from the user, why shouldn't the portlet know how to save it?
11:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> the ProductLocalServiceUtil class is responsible for centralizing the actual save action so that you don't have to change it across other portlets. But even if you put the "add logic" in the Impl class, yoyu still have to pass it the parameters so if you model changes in the future, you have to change the code everywhere anyway
11:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> the only option really you have to do what you want is to have a ProductHelper class that can take a request object, does the logic to build a new product and returns it to your portlet and then the portlet performs the save.
11:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> then you can use that helper class in all your portlets and if the logic changes, you can update just the ProductHelper class.
11:06 < jardineworks:#liferay> Really though, I think the effort out weighs the benefit. If you are going to be adding products from so mnay differnt places, you probably need  to revisit your user experience.
11:07 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> True. And not going to happen in my case anyway.
11:09 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> What about the dates?
11:09 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I kind of expected Liferay to handle that for me, but apparently it doesn't.
11:09 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Or did I miss something?
11:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> it doesn't
11:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> there might be a way to do it through the model-hints... tell hibernate to use a default value of new Date() or something, but I have never bothered to try that.
11:10 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> So why are they advertised as "audit fields"? Is there ANY default functionality associated with them or is just a convention because Liferay uses them everywhere?
11:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> you should also populate the companyID and groupID for scoping and permissions
11:11 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Yeah. So far I had hoped it would be done automatically. *sigh*
11:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> I think they just put them there as "you don't have to define these, we've templated them for you"... and the purpose of them being there in the skeleton is for auditing purposes...
11:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, Considering all the plumbing they give you for nothing? I think new Date() is a fair tradeoff :)
11:12 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I was thinking about groupID and companyID just now.
11:13 < jardineworks:#liferay> companyId is really only useful is you plan to have more than one portal instance (co-located).. the group one can be useful though
11:14 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> We have staging enabled.
11:14 < jardineworks:#liferay> i don't know anything about your end users though ... I would assume however that you would have groups and roles for different fucntions
11:14 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> This is only established via groupID, I think.
11:49 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> jardineworks: Have you ever worked with liferay-ui:tabs?
12:06 < jdcaddie:#liferay> Does anyone know how to import users into LR that ONLY exist in specific LDAP groups?
12:07 < jdcaddie:#liferay> I am a noob to liferay so any help is appreciated...
12:28 < topolik:#liferay> hi jardineworks, sorry, I'm maybe too late
12:28 < topolik:#liferay> did you solve the logging?
12:45 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik, nope
12:45 < jardineworks:#liferay> lol
12:49 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik, adaro was trying to help me yesterday but I think he misunderstood my issue. I think he thought I was trying to use JULI from a plugin.. but it;s actually that I am trying to use JULI in a jar and the plugin is using the jar, but its loaded from lib/ext
12:49 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik, if you are still there, can I ask you my service builder question?
12:49 < topolik:#liferay> sure
12:50 < topolik:#liferay> today I'll be here until I literally fall asleep
12:50 < topolik:#liferay> ;)
12:54 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik, do you mind if I pm you on this one?
12:54 < topolik:#liferay> pm?
12:54 < topolik:#liferay> aah
12:54 < topolik:#liferay> got it
12:54 < topolik:#liferay> sure, do what you need
12:55 < topolik:#liferay> jdcaddie, still here?
12:55 < topolik:#liferay> I believe that it's possible when the users carry the groupName attribute in their LDAP entry
12:57 < topolik:#liferay> then you should be able to create custom LDAP query in ldap.import.user.search.filter
12:57 < topolik:#liferay> sth like: (|(objectClass=inetOrgPerson)(groupName=...))
13:09 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> jardineworks: Thanks for your help. I call it a day now. :)
13:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, np -- have a good night
13:33 < jdcaddie:#liferay> topolik, I am here I had to step away
13:34 < jdcaddie:#liferay> Side question, should I create a .properties file for configurations like this?
13:35 < topolik:#liferay> you can either create portal-ext.properties and specify the LDAP connection there or configure it from UI
13:35 < topolik:#liferay> once you change it from UI the settings are saved in DB and portal-ext.properties is ignored
13:35 < jdcaddie:#liferay> When i configured ldap from my UI I broke local admin login functionallity
13:39 < jdcaddie:#liferay> what is the table that contains the base DN in the database 'mysql'
13:44 < topolik:#liferay> depends on portal version, try PortalPreferences table
13:45 < jdcaddie:#liferay> I just reverted my snapshot
13:45 < jdcaddie:#liferay> There was nothing in ProtalPreferences
13:48 < topolik:#liferay> hmm, I think once you configure LDAP you require your users to authenticate against it, even portal admin, but I'm not sure
13:50 < jardineworks:#liferay> does anyone know how to add the liferay/portlet_url.js to the list of javascript barebones files?
13:50 < jardineworks:#liferay> I tried adding it in my portal-ext as javascript.barebones.file=liferay/portlet_url.js but I am still getting a Liferay.PortletURL is undefined.
13:51 < topolik:#liferay> jardineworks: I think you have to regenerate the barebone file somehow
14:02 < jdcaddie:#liferay> topolik, thank for the help in regards to ldap
14:02 < jdcaddie:#liferay> I have another question for you
14:02 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik, restarting the portal wouldn't do that?
14:02 < topolik:#liferay> jardineworks: no, the files are cached on server
14:03 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik, what about stopping the server, dumping temp/work dirs and then restarting?
14:03 < topolik:#liferay> jardineworks: try to delete tomcat/work/Catalina/localhost/_aggregate/
14:03 < topolik:#liferay> yeah
14:03 < topolik:#liferay> I think you don't even need to stop the portal for this
14:04 < topolik:#liferay> jdcaddie: shoot
14:04 < jdcaddie:#liferay> ?
14:04 < jdcaddie:#liferay> I have my portal up and I am trying to get social office installed, I have "purchased" it from the marketplace although when attemping to install it the status icon just spins
14:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik, too late! :)
14:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> :(
14:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik, still getting undefined
14:15 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik, the files that you specify in the portal-ext -- are those appended to the ones in the portal.portperties?
14:22 < topolik:#liferay> jdcaddie: anything in your log file?
14:22 < topolik:#liferay> jardineworks: let me try
14:23 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik, I think I put an s on barebone .. trying to see if that fixes it
14:25 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik, yikes! looks like a replace.
14:25 < topolik:#liferay> jardineworks: for 6.1. the minified content should be in tomcat/temp/liferay/minifier
14:25 < jardineworks:#liferay> I have a ton of AUI errors now for the docbar
14:25 < topolik:#liferay> aah, sorry, forgot to reploy :)
14:26 < jardineworks:#liferay> so if I want to augment the barebones I have to copy the content from portal.properties and add mine to the end?!
14:26 < topolik:#liferay> yes
14:26 < topolik:#liferay> portal-ext.properties doesn't work like properties in hooks
14:26 < jardineworks:#liferay> ugh
14:26 < topolik:#liferay> it's injected by include-and-override=portal-ext.properties
14:27 < jardineworks:#liferay> can I use a hook to add the value?!
14:27 < jardineworks:#liferay> :)
14:27 < topolik:#liferay> nope
14:27 < jardineworks:#liferay> :(
14:30 < jardineworks:#liferay> sooo.. I have to crack open the portal-impl, dig out the portal.properties file, find my setting and copy it over.
14:30 < jardineworks:#liferay> yikes.
14:30 < jardineworks:#liferay> that seems a little clumsy
16:25 < topolik:#liferay> I'm going to bed, bye jardineworks, jdcaddie!
16:26 < jdcaddie:#liferay> cya thanks for the help
17:07 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf are you around?
17:07 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah but on concall
17:08 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, full concentration required or can I ask you a serviceLocator question (rotty told me that you were the man to talk to for this stuff)
17:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, my day is pretty well done to be honest. I need to go get my son so I'll check in with you tomorrow (if I don't figure it out tonight) ... :)
17:10 <@jhf:#liferay> k
17:10 <@jhf:#liferay> thx.. ill be around tomorrow
17:10 <@jhf:#liferay> going to see Matisyahu tonight!
17:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, just googled that. don't think I am jealous :)
17:12 <@jhf:#liferay> hahah
