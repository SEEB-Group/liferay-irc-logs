02:40 < g33kyboi:#liferay> hello there
02:50 < g33kyboi:#liferay> pls i need help with using ajax on liferay portlet
02:50 < g33kyboi:#liferay> when i hit the resource url thru ajax, the response which is a well formed html table is not loaded into the specified div
03:12 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> g33kyboi, are you using jquery or aui for ajax?
03:13 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> g33kyboi, look at http://www.liferay.com/community/forums/-/message_boards/message/6694314
03:20 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> hello, all.  how can i create a custom settings panel in customize dialog of my custom portlet?
07:04 < modd:#liferay> hi there. any liferay employee online? maybe topolic? ;)
07:43 < Axxell:#liferay> hey guys, trying to update to liferay 6.1.2 ga3 and having trouble with my existing portlets on eclipse with liferay IDE, is there anyway i can update the existing projects to work with the new plugins sdk and the new server?
07:44 < Axxell:#liferay> and when a portlet gets "blacklisted" from the autodeploy, how do i get it of the blacklist?
07:49 < jardineworks:#liferay> Axxell, you can purge the blacklist by restarting the server
07:49 < jardineworks:#liferay> Axxell, did you download the new sdk?
07:49 < Axxell:#liferay> yeah i did
07:50 < Axxell:#liferay> just dont know how i easily move my existing projects to the new plugins sdk
07:50 < jardineworks:#liferay> Axxell, maybe you already did this, but did you add a new SDK defintion to our settings in the IDE?
07:50 < Axxell:#liferay> yeah i did, but it seems to still be a bit confused
07:51 < Axxell:#liferay> even when i change for a single project the plugins sdk, the name of the old sdk remains
07:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> Axxell, oh -- I just usually cp -r [old sdk]/portlets [new sdk]/portlets :)
07:51 < Axxell:#liferay> do i need to manually create new projects from existing sources?
07:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> try copyign the files on the command line. In the IDE close the projects and then import them from the new SDK
07:52 < jardineworks:#liferay> I don't think so
07:52 < Axxell:#liferay> how do i force eclipse to use the new sdk?
07:53 < Axxell:#liferay> well ok, it seems that i create a new project it will use the new sdk
07:53 < jardineworks:#liferay> its been a while since I have had to migrate one to be honest ... 6.0.x I think. If you import the project from the new sdk folder -- I think it should pick it up.
07:54 < Axxell:#liferay> but the existing projects dont seem to migrate easily
07:54 < jardineworks:#liferay> what do you mean by easily?
07:54 < Axxell:#liferay> well i would like to just change the properties of the existing project to use the new sdk and recompile
07:55 < Axxell:#liferay> in my "package explorer" in eclipse all my existing projects are listed and if I try to create a new project from existing source it says that the project allready exists
07:55 < jardineworks:#liferay> see what happens if you copy one over to the new sdk location (refrence my cp comment above) and then from the shell try ant deploy and see what happens
07:56 < jardineworks:#liferay> I wonder what would happen if you copied all the hooks, portlets, etc over to the new SDK and then in the IDE just changed the sdk reference (globally I mean) to point to the new SDK
07:57 < jardineworks:#liferay> all the names should still resolve... and it being the only SDK in the IDE, it means it should use it when you click on your ant targets ]
07:57 < jardineworks:#liferay> feels like cheating... but you never know :)
07:57 < Axxell:#liferay> i think i might be getting it to work, there was a version number in liferay-plugin-package-properties
07:58 < Axxell:#liferay> i changed it from 6.1.1 to 6.1.2
07:58 < jardineworks:#liferay> ah
07:58 < Axxell:#liferay> and it works
07:58 < jardineworks:#liferay> yeah -- that is the maximum version it supports... forgot about that :)
07:58 < Axxell:#liferay> i did get the project files to have all the new jars and that
07:59 < jardineworks:#liferay> so did you move anything to the new SDK? or did it create them for you (on disk I mean) automatically?
08:02 < Axxell:#liferay> actually i changed the settings of the project in eclipse to use new server, new plugins sdk, copied the new sdk over the old sdk (dangerous games) and changed the version number
08:02 < Axxell:#liferay> it seems to be working on the local server
08:03 < Axxell:#liferay> the portlet is blacklisted on the other server im trying to build a page on so a restart there is in order
08:04 < Axxell:#liferay> lets se if this is going to work
08:04 < Axxell:#liferay> i just didnt get it how to get the package explorer to show the projects in the new sdk if i copy those over
08:24 < jardineworks:#liferay> Axxell, good to know! I had forgotten about that propery. When I first started with LR I thought that I could use it to take the build number of my portlets ... i remember having more than a  few hours of issues trying to figure out when everything was being black listed :)

09:14 < sm``:#liferay> hello... how do i set value to a hidden element
09:14 < sm``:#liferay> with AUI
09:14 < sm``:#liferay> i select it with var gf = A.one('#galleryflag');
09:17 < sm``:#liferay> .val()
09:17 < sm``:#liferay> ;]
10:14 < jardineworks:#liferay> does anyone know if it is possible to export and entire "site" -- content, configuration and all -- to a LAR?
10:24 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Isn't that what the export feature in the control panel does?
10:25 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> You even get options to select what to export.
13:53 < dave_k:#liferay> I'm facepalming about https://www.liferay.com/documentation/liferay-portal/6.1/user-guide/-/ai/lp-6-1-ugen11-installing-liferay-on-tomcat-7-0
13:53 < dave_k:#liferay> Some tags from the XML in the examples are actually now interpreted as HTML ...
13:56 < dave_k:#liferay> E.g. this here is delivered by the server outside the <pre> environment, where it should be: <Context path="" crossContext="true">
13:56 < dave_k:#liferay> and the browser does not show it...
13:57 < dave_k:#liferay> I can't even comment on that page, despite being logged in.
13:58 < dave_k:#liferay> Also, the "User's Guide" PDF does not show these parts.
13:59 < dave_k:#liferay> What's the best way to report that?
14:09 < dave_k:#liferay> okay, I'm going home for today ...
14:19 < jeffj_:#liferay> Good day guys, just want to ask some suggestions on my requirement as i am not really sure yet on how to implement it-  I need to be able to restrict users from viewing other organizations data   I tried to implement restrictions of portlets using CustomLoginAction via Hook  and I have a Service Builder that has JSONWS that already is working getAllSalesByDay(int filterCode, int providerId)  My problem is that I tried to create the Us
14:19 < jeffj_:#liferay>  (Users_Orgs table)- so I have all the users belongs to a certain organization - they will all be using one reusable portlet to display the grid, but im not sure how to implement it right now - my providerId came from the externalDB
14:21 < jeffj_:#liferay> i was thinking to use the custom attribute but im not really sure if its the right approach to my problem
14:59 < jeffj_:#liferay> anyone here?
15:02 < aj__:#liferay> i'm here
15:04 < jeffj_:#liferay> thanks Aj
15:04 < jeffj_:#liferay> may I ask you something about liferay
15:05 < aj__:#liferay> sure
15:05 < jeffj_:#liferay> just want to ask some suggestions on my requirement as i am not really sure yet on how to implement it-  I need to be able to restrict users from viewing other organizations data   I tried to implement restrictions of portlets using CustomLoginAction via Hook  and I have a Service Builder that has JSONWS that already is working getAllSalesByDay(int filterCode, int providerId)  My problem is that I tried to create the Users in an Organ
15:05 < jeffj_:#liferay> (Users_Orgs table)- so I have all the users belongs to a certain organization - they will all be using one reusable portlet to display the grid, but im not sure how to implement it right now - my providerId came from the externalDB
15:05 < aj__:#liferay> can't promise I know the answer haha
15:05 < jeffj_:#liferay> no worries :)
15:06 < aj__:#liferay> (reading)
15:06 < aj__:#liferay> make sure I understand -- lets play 20 questions
15:06 < aj__:#liferay> 1. You have more than one organization
15:06 < jeffj_:#liferay> yes
15:06 < aj__:#liferay> 2. you have users that are in each organization, but not shared.
15:07 < jeffj_:#liferay> yup
15:07 < jeffj_:#liferay> 2; correct
15:07 < aj__:#liferay> .. addendum to 1, you have created more than one organization in liferay right? and have assigned users accordingly to be members of their respective orgs
15:07 < jeffj_:#liferay> yes
15:07 < jeffj_:#liferay> correct again
15:08 < aj__:#liferay> ok -- when you create the data, do you associate it to an organization?
15:08 < jeffj_:#liferay> nope
15:09 < jeffj_:#liferay> because we're just getting the datafeed
15:09 < aj__:#liferay> ok -- what is the data? just to give me concrete to picture
15:10 < jeffj_:#liferay> providerId, date, agencyA, AgencyB, and AgencyC
15:11 < aj__:#liferay> but what does it represent I mean
15:11 < jeffj_:#liferay> the providerID represents the Organizations
15:12 < jeffj_:#liferay> but since orgId is dynamically created in Liferay
15:12 < jeffj_:#liferay> it is different from my providerId
15:12 < jeffj_:#liferay> i was thinking on how to associate both
15:12 < aj__:#liferay> hmmm -- what if you only created organizations on the fly in Liferay and specified their ID during creation? that way the IDs would be synchronized.
15:12 < jeffj_:#liferay> so that i could have the corect organization, correct user and correct data , but associating the providerId
15:14 < jeffj_:#liferay> hmm.. if that is possible that would be great
15:15 < jeffj_:#liferay> because i could get the the providerId from my service and save the organizations using the providerId as the orgId
15:15 < aj__:#liferay> the createOrganization method on the local service util does allow you to specify a primary key -- I've done this before with users. I just created the users when they were needed... so basically, a user logs in, they are a member of providerId -- 1234 but that organization does not yet exist, so you call a service to get the details, create the org and associate the user
15:15 < aj__:#liferay> bingo bango
15:16 < aj__:#liferay> most of the time you see OrganizationLocalServiceUtil.addOrganization( CounterLocalServiceUtil.increment( Organization.class)); .. but you can give it your own value
15:16 < jeffj_:#liferay> do you have it on your blog? i think i have read some of your blog before
15:16 < jeffj_:#liferay> :)
15:16 < aj__:#liferay> unlikely... my blog is full of posts, just never published haha
15:17 < aj__:#liferay> they're all short of polish -- but they'll be coming soon -- when work slows down a bit
15:17 < jeffj_:#liferay> may i ask a sample implementation?
15:17 < jeffj_:#liferay> :)
15:18 < aj__:#liferay> You can also create a service wrapper for addOrganization ... and then you can specify your own add organization logic where you call your service to get the details instead of using the LR form (assuming that orgs will never be created in LR)
15:18 < aj__:#liferay> sample implementation or what? saving an organization?
15:18 < jeffj_:#liferay> hmmm i think i know now how to add org
15:19 < jeffj_:#liferay> its most likely the same as adding book example
15:19 < jeffj_:#liferay> from the tutorials ive read
15:19 < jeffj_:#liferay> just need to see the api
15:19 < jeffj_:#liferay> on adding org
15:19 < jeffj_:#liferay> but one question right now i've been adding users manually
15:19 < jeffj_:#liferay> and the same in organization
15:20 < aj__:#liferay> have you downloaded the portal source?
15:20 < jeffj_:#liferay> i've have liferay 6.1 ga2 CE running on my local
15:20 < aj__:#liferay> but did you download the source code as well, not the bundle...
15:20 < jeffj_:#liferay> and added 2 organizations and 3 users for wach org
15:21 < jeffj_:#liferay> i have the bundle actually
15:21 < jeffj_:#liferay> each*
15:21 < aj__:#liferay> ok -- and the SDK i guess
15:21 < jeffj_:#liferay> yup
15:21 < jeffj_:#liferay> same version of sdk
15:21 < aj__:#liferay> ok -- go back and download the portal-source.
15:21 < aj__:#liferay> are you using eclipse?
15:21 < jeffj_:#liferay> yes
15:21 < aj__:#liferay> have you installed the LR plugins?
15:22 < jeffj_:#liferay> yup
15:22 < jeffj_:#liferay> (downloading portal source now)
15:22 < aj__:#liferay> ok -- unpack the source at the same level of the sdk (or wherever -- that's just my preference :) ) and then import existing JAVA project and point it to the portal source folder.
15:23 < aj__:#liferay> then you can use the CTRL-SHIRT-R to launch the resource dialog window. It with the portal source is your best friend. You type OrganizationLocalServiceUtil ,,, and then start walking the code. You'll find out how Liferay adds an organization after you hit save.
15:23 < aj__:#liferay> copy it, paste it, and modigy it to what you need
15:24 < jeffj_:#liferay> cool!
15:24 < jeffj_:#liferay> ill try that
15:24 < aj__:#liferay> 90% of what you wnat to do, if yo uare using LR properly is referenceable somewhere in the source
15:24 < aj__:#liferay> and the more you do it, the more of LR source yo uneed to read, the better you will understand LR
15:24 < jeffj_:#liferay> thats a nice strategy
15:25 < jeffj_:#liferay> thanks for pointing me to that
15:25 < jeffj_:#liferay> and from there i could debug and understand more on how to do it
15:25 < jeffj_:#liferay> (still downloading the portal source for 261MB)
15:26 < aj__:#liferay> np -- the realy benefit to open source is lifting the hood and seeing what is going on
15:27 < jeffj_:#liferay> i think ill just create a portlet the will add a users and have the organization dropdown
15:27 < jeffj_:#liferay> and from saving it I could get the providerId first and put it to the Users_Orgs table
15:27 < jeffj_:#liferay> and Users_ table
15:28 < jeffj_:#liferay> and Organizations table
15:28 < jeffj_:#liferay> is that right?
15:28 < jeffj_:#liferay> so i could have the trigger in putting the association of the users and org
15:32 < aj__:#liferay> jeffj_, does your service have a method to getAllOrganizations?
15:32 < jeffj_:#liferay> not yet but i could add that service
15:33 < jeffj_:#liferay> using a finder right?
15:33 < aj__:#liferay> if it did, you could even disable the ability to add organizations in the control panel and then have a startup hook call your service, get the list of orgs and then find ones that are missing in LR and add them
15:33 < aj__:#liferay> then when you go to add a user, like you normally do in LR, the "add Orgnization" feature remains the same. All you have done is changed the way they are added to the portal.
15:34 < aj__:#liferay> and with the stratup hook be hot oundeployable, if the logic for adding orgs ever changes, you can just undeploy it
15:34 < aj__:#liferay> I did the something similar with users... I did a startup action to synch users, and a JSP override to disable the add user button. Undeploy both and it all goes back to normal.
15:35 < jeffj_:#liferay> meaning you will have your own custom add Users?
15:35 < jeffj_:#liferay> and disable the Users and Organization in Control Panel?
15:38 < aj__:#liferay> In my case I disabled the ability to add users in the control panel
15:38 < aj__:#liferay> all other user management (deleting, inactiviting, etc) was permitted.
15:39 < aj__:#liferay> I just set the "Save" button for the user form to be disabled. and deployed the hook
15:40 < jeffj_:#liferay> what about add organization??
15:40 < jeffj_:#liferay> how did you disable the add users?
15:41 < aj__:#liferay> create a JSP hook... hook the jsp page from the control panel that is used to add users. It will give you the entire page code... find the button where the user submit and set it to disabled. Or you can set the onclick to show an alert telling the user that users cannot be added manually through the control panel.
15:42 < jeffj_:#liferay> ok, i got a question on Hook,
15:42 < jeffj_:#liferay> i already created one hook to implement the customloginaction
15:43 < jeffj_:#liferay> can i include
15:43 < jeffj_:#liferay> to that existing hook
15:43 < jeffj_:#liferay> the disable button for adding users?
15:43 < jeffj_:#liferay> it is a separate portlet right?
15:44 < aj__:#liferay> you can put all your hooks in the same project if you want. I personally keep them seperate so that I can undeploy one without affecting the others.
15:45 < jeffj_:#liferay> thats reasonable
15:45 < aj__:#liferay> Just think of the tasks and group logically. For example, I have a xxx-configuration-settings-portlet -- and really, part of that includes the disabling of a add user. So that project has a couple of portlets, and a couple of hooks because all functionality is related.
15:45 < aj__:#liferay> volatile things? things that clients ask for that you know once they get it they will change their mind? those get their own projects :)
15:46 < aj__:#liferay> and you can't put a price on being on a conference call when your client is asking how much it would cost to
15:46 < aj__:#liferay> ...
15:46 < aj__:#liferay> "add a user in the control panel again"
15:46 < aj__:#liferay> and you pause
15:46 < aj__:#liferay> ... and say nothing. it's done.
15:46 < aj__:#liferay> the pause was just watching the hook undeploy.
15:47 < jeffj_:#liferay> lolz clients
15:47 < jeffj_:#liferay> ^_^ thats exactly what i have
15:47 < jeffj_:#liferay> and we got one in common
15:48 < aj__:#liferay> dude. all clients are the same.
15:48 < aj__:#liferay> that's all any of us have in common :)
15:48 < jeffj_:#liferay> how do you undeploy? by just deleting the war file and the portlet folder?
15:48 < jeffj_:#liferay> would it not affect the liferay database?
15:50 < aj__:#liferay> yeah - you just go to the webapps folder and rm -rf [portlet|hook|theme] ... (assuming you are using *NIX)
15:50 < aj__:#liferay> if does affect the database. There is a table called ServiceComponent where they're all registered.
15:50 < aj__:#liferay> but its not a big deal, you just re-deploy
15:51 < aj__:#liferay> it only sucks if you have prefrences and such... those are lost
15:54 < jeffj_:#liferay> yup, cause i've tried creating or setting up liferay locally for 5 times now
15:55 < jeffj_:#liferay> and bump into some databse issues
15:55 < jeffj_:#liferay> cause im playing around jboss and tomcat
15:55 < jeffj_:#liferay> bundles
15:55 < jeffj_:#liferay> and sometimes i bumped into some db issues which im not really familiar yet
15:55 < jeffj_:#liferay> yes im using *NIX
15:57 < jeffj_:#liferay> and last time i read is that i need to manually click on X on portlets
15:57 < jeffj_:#liferay> and do the deletion of folders
15:57 < jeffj_:#liferay> to undeploy it successfully
15:58 < aj__:#liferay> if you don't X out the portlets and delete the wars you just end up with messages telling you that the portlet was undeployed.
15:58 < aj__:#liferay> semi-transparent text
16:02 < jeffj_:#liferay> yup, but once I have those messages I dont think I know what I need to do at first
16:02 < jeffj_:#liferay> as I think LR has the deployed portlets saved in the DB
16:02 < jeffj_:#liferay> is that right?
16:03 < modd:#liferay> jhf: poke
16:03 <@jhf:#liferay> heya modd
16:04 < modd:#liferay> do you know since when ancud it is a lr silver partner?
16:04 <@jhf:#liferay> checking..
16:04 < aj__:#liferay> jeffj_, I don't think so. I think the message is a detection that the resources are gonezo... but rather than give you a gross stacktrace, you get something friendly. If you go to the add component, they're gone. At that stage either you redeploy and they magically appear, or you X them out and their references (including settings) are gone (from the database)
16:05 < jeffj_:#liferay> ty aj brb
16:05 < aj__:#liferay> np --
16:05 < aj__:#liferay> jhf, (jardineworks here) I got that problem we were talking about solved on Friday using generics as you suggested. I even build my own "service builder" that generates the services from a configuration file :)
16:06 < aj__:#liferay> 104 services in 265 milliseconds -- as opposed to 2 weeks of boredom.
16:06 <@jhf:#liferay> aj__: !!! nicely done!
16:06 <@jhf:#liferay> modd: looks like since Nov 2010
16:06 < aj__:#liferay> thanks for the advice. once I got my head around it -- definitely the best choice.
16:06 < modd:#liferay> oh..cool, thx!
16:07 < modd:#liferay> it's good that the search function of liferay.com shows a result for my name so they can check what I've done^^
17:42 < aj__:#liferay> hey jhf -- are you still around?
18:17 < jeffj_:#liferay> hi aj_ : still there?
