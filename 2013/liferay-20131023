02:03 < Axxell:#liferay> hey guys, been trying to think about a way to make a bootstrap theme for liferay, that wouldnt use liferay layouts, but would use bootstraps way of doing layouts ie. rows and span1-12(bootstrap 2.3, called differently in 3). Any idea how one would be able to do that?
02:19 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Axxell: If I recall correctly, the new layout in 6.2 is built with Bootstrap.
02:21 < Axxell:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur: the theme is made with bootstrap, but adding rows and defining portlet width with the bootstrap 12 column modell is not there.. based on liferay 6.2 rc5 it still uses fixed page layouts as all liferay versions have
02:22 < Axxell:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur:  what i would like to do is add a bootstrap row, add a portlet to that row, define its width trough settings, and add portlets to that row until the sum of portlet widths are 12 columns
02:22 < Axxell:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur: then that row would be "full" and a new row needs to be added to add more portlets..
02:23 < Axxell:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur: ie the way bootstrap works
02:23 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Mhm. Never worked with Bootstrap myself...sounds like an interesting idea but implementing it...phew.
02:24 < Axxell:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur: that gives total layout freedom
02:24 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I guess you could use the Look and Feel settings for each portlet for the "settings" part of what you want to do.
02:25 < Axxell:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur: yup but adding rows.. and how to override how liferay handles portlet widths and such...
02:25 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> For the handling of the rows you could try using Liferay's layouts...you would have to set the number of columns first though.
02:25 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Uhm. Number of rows, sorry.
02:27 < Axxell:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur: yeah would like to have complete freedom with number of rows
02:27 < Axxell:#liferay> *number of columns
02:27 < Axxell:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur: could do my own version of nested portlet to add rows as i like to
02:29 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> True. But the usability would probably suffer a bit.
02:30 < Axxell:#liferay> well designing new layouts is easy enough with liferay ide.. would just be nice not to have
02:30 < Axxell:#liferay> any restrictions on layout
02:31 < Axxell:#liferay> would just add to look and feel bootstrap column width css classes
02:31 < Axxell:#liferay> hmm well
02:31 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Can't say much on the topic...it's all just speculation.
02:32 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> For my current project we have only 1-column layouts.
02:32 < Axxell:#liferay> indeed, ill guess i put som time on to test if i can manage to do any of that
02:32 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> And everybody keeps complaining that there even is the option to change the layout because it's "confusing".
02:32 < Axxell:#liferay> mmmmf users
02:32 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> They pretty much expect us to make Liferay follow 100% of the style guide automatically.
02:33 < Axxell:#liferay> Margaritas ante porcos, they say
02:34 < Axxell:#liferay> well users are funny creatures, they complain and complain, you make something to remedy what they complain about and they still complain
02:34 < Axxell:#liferay> it has to do with them not actually wanting to work
02:34 < Axxell:#liferay> as long as they find a scapegoat not to work, they will complain
02:35 < Axxell:#liferay> at least this is my experience :D
02:35 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> True.
02:35 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> In our case the main problem is lack of communication.
02:36 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Instead of explaining to the developers what they wish to achieve, they just tell what we're supposed to do.
02:36 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> So we often maneuver around Liferay instead of finding a proper solution with Liferay.
02:37 < Axxell:#liferay> mmmf trying to bend the tools to fit the user is often a long and frustrating process, when it often doesnt fix anything
02:37 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I'm trying to get everybody on board, but old habits die hard.
02:38 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Alright...I'm off to work. Good luck with your layout idea. :)
05:34 < rocknroll_:#liferay> hey all. jsonws question. i want to use a specific, dedicated user to fetch calendar events via jsonws
05:35 < rocknroll_:#liferay> what sort of combination of permissions does this user need? I keep getting rg.hibernate.exception.SQLGrammarException: could not execute query
05:36 < rocknroll_:#liferay> when i do this as myself, it works fine
05:36 < rocknroll_:#liferay> it's an ajax call, with http basic auth
05:37 < rocknroll_:#liferay> the actual error is  com.mysql.jdbc.exceptions.MySQLSyntaxErrorException: Unknown column 'calEvent.type' in 'where clause'
05:37 < rocknroll_:#liferay> which to me is pretty WTF
05:55 < rocknroll_:#liferay> ok. looks like the calendar-user needs to be site owner?
05:58 < rocknroll_:#liferay> or rather, calendar-user-role needs to have permisson "site owner[view]"
06:18 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Hey guys. Anybody got an idea how I could obtain the CDNHost in a journal template?
06:18 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I know I can use $portalUtil.getCDNHost() for that, but the method is deprecated and should be used with the secure parameter.
06:19 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> But I don't know how to get the secure flag properly.
06:19 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Because $request.theme-display.secure doesn't work, because it has the wrong type.
06:26 < topolik:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur: I think PortalUtil has a method - isSecure(request)
06:27 < topolik:#liferay> so try sth like this: $portalUtil.getCDNHost($portalUtil.isSecure($request))
06:27 < topolik:#liferay> what portal version do you use?
06:30 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> 6.1.0
06:30 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Sadly.
06:32 < topolik:#liferay> ok
06:32 < topolik:#liferay> and your CDN supports HTTPS?\
06:32 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> It's a S3 bucket.
06:33 < topolik:#liferay> and your portal supports HTTPS?
06:33 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Not yet, but we're working on it. ;)
06:33 < topolik:#liferay> aah, good! +1
06:34 < topolik:#liferay> ok, then $portalUtil.getCDNHost($portalUtil.isSecure($request)) should be the best solution
06:34 < topolik:#liferay> does it work?
06:36 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Looks like it doesn't work.
06:36 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I get a NullPointerException.
06:36 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> #set( $isSecure = $portalUtil.isSecure($request) )
06:36 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> #set( $cdnhost = $portalUtil.getCDNHost($isSecure) )
06:36 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> That's what I tried.
06:37 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Invocation of method 'getCDNHost' in  class com.liferay.portal.util.PortalImpl threw exception java.lang.NullPointerException at 10154#75202#2466429[line 21, column 30]
06:37 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> It's a velocity template.
06:45 < topolik:#liferay> it's a theme?
07:08 < topolik:#liferay> I tried it and it works in a theme velocity template
07:31 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Ah. No. It's not a theme. It's a journal template.
11:14 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik, you still there?
11:25 < jardineworks:#liferay> maybe someone else is around. I am using the liferay-portlet-url js file to create a render url dynamically. I attach the function the the href of a <a> tag passing in the unique id.
11:25 < jardineworks:#liferay> That works, the url is created and the parameter for the category Id is set.
11:25 < jardineworks:#liferay> I now want to "call" the user so that it does the render phase and loads a new page.
11:26 < jardineworks:#liferay> but everytime I click the link, I get the same page back
12:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey topolik -- do you still have that code snippet handy that you shared with me that showed how to get a portlets id in js?
14:49 < topolik:#liferay> jardineworks: Hi, uhm, I don't remember that snippet
14:49 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik, remember you were helping me with Portlet URLs in JS?
14:50 < topolik:#liferay> no
14:50 < topolik:#liferay> :D
14:50 < jardineworks:#liferay> it was a few weeks back... and you help a lot of people so I am not surprised haha
14:50 < topolik:#liferay> ok, what do you need?
14:51 < topolik:#liferay> portlet id from a JS?
14:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> yeah -- is there a way to get the portlet ID dynamically?
14:51 < topolik:#liferay> hmm
14:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> i have everything working, but I have my portlet id hard coded -- boo
14:52 < topolik:#liferay> can you show me your code?
14:53 < jardineworks:#liferay> paste it in here?
14:53 < jardineworks:#liferay> you wanna see just the js?
14:53 < topolik:#liferay> let's start with the JS
14:54 < topolik:#liferay> can you make it public, e.g. using pastie?
14:54 < jardineworks:#liferay> sure one sec
14:54 < jardineworks:#liferay> http://pastie.org/8424845
14:56 < topolik:#liferay> hmm, I see
14:56 < topolik:#liferay> the problem is that the function is public
14:57 < topolik:#liferay> the function doesn't know who calls it
14:57 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik, you mean I should be using either aui:script or prefixing with <portlet:namespace/>
14:57 < jardineworks:#liferay> ?
14:58 < topolik:#liferay> don't know, it depends on your requirements
14:58 < topolik:#liferay> but I think it's good to put all JS into a separate file
14:59 < topolik:#liferay> Liferay use stateful objects with _config parameters
14:59 < topolik:#liferay> in short - can you provide the portletID as just another parameter to the function?
15:00 < jardineworks:#liferay> oh -- well, I can probably pass it into this one as well. I thought you had something that was a shortcut that let you do it in JS
15:13 < topolik:#liferay> well, I think there is some variable that holds all portlet ids on the page
15:13 < topolik:#liferay> but how do you know which one to use?
15:13 < topolik:#liferay> you could also take that portletId from some variable that is initialized from the portlet itself
15:13 < jardineworks:#liferay> it's in the themedisplay I think right? I could always <%= portletId %> as a parameter in the function.
15:14 < jardineworks:#liferay> I just thought that there was a way to get it using the JS
15:14 < topolik:#liferay> don't know of anything, but I'm not a JS guy so that doesn't mean there isn't any :)
15:15 < jardineworks:#liferay> fair enough. deadlines are deadlines and this code isn't moving (nor is the porlet name changing) so for now .. constant it is!
15:15 < jardineworks:#liferay> :)
