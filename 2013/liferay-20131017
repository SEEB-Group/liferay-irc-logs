04:24 < hufg:#liferay> how can i edit wiki
04:24 < hufg:#liferay> http://www.liferay.com/community/wiki/-/wiki/Main/How+to+configure+the+logs+in+Liferay
04:24 < hufg:#liferay> this is plain wrong for glassfish
04:24 < hufg:#liferay> the liferay forums make me want to shoot myself in the face
04:25 < hufg:#liferay> people hoping for a quick win and nothing else
04:27 < hufg:#liferay> topolik: how can the wiki be edited
04:27 < topolik:#liferay> hi hufg, which wiki?
04:28 < hufg:#liferay> http://www.liferay.com/community/wiki/-/wiki/Main/How+to+configure+the+logs+in+Liferay this is false for glassfish
04:28 < topolik:#liferay> do you see the "Edit" link ?
04:29 < hufg:#liferay> user account is all i need?
04:29 < topolik:#liferay> aah, yes
04:29 < topolik:#liferay> you need to register
04:30 < hufg:#liferay> could you just update the portal-log4j-ext.xml path for gf 3.1.2 to be domain-dir/lib/classes/META-INF/portal-log4j-ext.xml
04:31 < hufg:#liferay> and for your future domain classloading path needs:
04:31 < hufg:#liferay> 		Enumeration<URL> en; 		try { 			en = getClass().getClassLoader().getResources("META-INF/test.txt"); 			while (en.hasMoreElements()) { 				LOGGER.fatal(en.nextElement().toString()); 			} 		} catch (IOException e) { 			// TODO Auto-generated catch block 			e.printStackTrace(); 		}
04:31 < hufg:#liferay> woops
04:31 < hufg:#liferay> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/6c9c2303f25e351b943e
04:33 < topolik:#liferay> where should I update it?
04:33 < hufg:#liferay>  Glassfish 3.1.1: This technique does not work for Glassfish. (See this forum post for an alternative)
04:33 < hufg:#liferay> i'm willing to bet it works for 3.1.1 too
04:34 < hufg:#liferay> i have 3.1.2
04:34 < hufg:#liferay> 50euros that it works in 3.1.1
04:34 < topolik:#liferay> so there I put: "domain-dir/lib/classes/META-INF/portal-log4j-ext.xml", right?
04:34 < hufg:#liferay> it would be INCREDIBLE that a classloader would get the path wrong in 3.1.1, that would be some serious issues in the gf core
04:34 < hufg:#liferay> yes
04:35 < topolik:#liferay> ok and the second code?
04:35 < hufg:#liferay> you can add confirmed in 3.1.2
04:35 < hufg:#liferay> just add it to the comments
04:35 < hufg:#liferay> :D
04:35 < hufg:#liferay> if you wish
04:35 < hufg:#liferay> you can print any path with that snippet
04:35 < hufg:#liferay> deploy a portlet and see where it finds the file
04:36 < hufg:#liferay> you don't need tho, it's just an easy way to get any path in any app server
04:36 < hufg:#liferay> and print it with liferay logger
04:36 < hufg:#liferay> for example in gf the choices are webapp deployment, domain/lib, domain/lib/ext, domain/lib/classes, glassfish/modules/
04:37 < topolik:#liferay> https://www.liferay.com/community/wiki/-/wiki/Main/Configuring+Logs#section-Configuring+Logs-Creating+a+custom+configuration+file:+portal-log4j-ext.xml
04:37 < topolik:#liferay> ok ?
04:38 < hufg:#liferay> yes gr8
04:38 < topolik:#liferay> I believe ppl with 3.1.1 try that too :)
04:38 < topolik:#liferay> thanks!
04:57 < hufg:#liferay> topolik: you work for liferay right?
05:09 < topolik:#liferay> yes
05:12 < hufg:#liferay> you have some internal stuff running on liferay?
05:12 < hufg:#liferay> or perhaps liferay.com?
05:19 < topolik:#liferay> yes, Liferay use both portal and SO internally
06:14 < Mediii:#liferay> Hi there
06:14 < Mediii:#liferay> I encounter a Plugin Deployment Troubleshooting  when I am trying to deploy some layout with liferay-portal-6.1.0 here is the stack trace http://pastie.org/8408778
06:16 < Mediii:#liferay> the http://plugins.liferay.com seems to be down, anyone knows how can I disable the check on this url during plugin deployment in liferay ?
06:42 < topolik:#liferay> Mediii: I think the error with http://plugins.liferay.com/community doesn't relate to the deployment issue
06:43 < Mediii:#liferay> topolik:  do you mean it is proxy  issue on my server ?
06:43 < topolik:#liferay> can be
06:43 < topolik:#liferay> com.liferay.portal.kernel.xml.DocumentException: Connection timed out Nested exception: Connection timed out
06:44 < topolik:#liferay> this means that the SAX parser is trying to load some XML definition but it's unable to connect to the server to get that definition file (XSD/DTD)
06:44 < Mediii:#liferay> ok, anyway is it possible to disable this behaviour of the plugin installer ?
06:45 < Mediii:#liferay> and force the deployment ? or these files are required and mandatory for the deployement process ?
06:47 < topolik:#liferay> to disable the plugin installer set these properties to empty, default values are :
06:47 < topolik:#liferay>     plugin.repositories.trusted=http://plugins.liferay.com/official
06:47 < topolik:#liferay>     plugin.repositories.untrusted=http://plugins.liferay.com/community
06:48 < topolik:#liferay> to finish the deployment you need your server to have an internet access
06:49 < topolik:#liferay> or remove the DTD definition from your liferay-layout-templates.xml file
06:57 < Mediii:#liferay> is it possible to increase the timeout ?
06:58 < Mediii:#liferay> I have niticed that my server is very slow to connect to the plugins.liferay.com
06:59 < Mediii:#liferay> and the timeout of the plugin installer is too short
06:59 < Mediii:#liferay> how can I increase this timeout ?
07:05 < topolik:#liferay> I think the problem is not related to plugins.liferay.com
07:06 < topolik:#liferay> but to http://www.liferay.com/dtd/liferay-layout-templates_6_1_0.dtd
07:06 < topolik:#liferay> to be precise
07:08 < Mediii:#liferay> Yes I agree with that but it seems to be a network issue on my server and the best solution for me is to increase the plugin installer's timeout when it connect to the liferay repo
07:08 < Mediii:#liferay> is ti possible to set the timeout ?
07:08 < topolik:#liferay> looking at the stacktrace, it's dom4j's SAXReader who opens it
07:11 < Mediii:#liferay> it is strange but I have copied the same liferay and its portlets/themes and layouts and it wokrs fine on my local machine
07:11 < Mediii:#liferay> it is clearly a network issue
07:11 < topolik:#liferay> yes, looking at the exception, it is a network issue :D
07:12 < Mediii:#liferay> :)
07:12 < Mediii:#liferay> So is it possible to set the timeout via portal-ext or other stuff ?
07:13 < topolik:#liferay> ok
07:13 < topolik:#liferay> try to set this to your portal-ext.properties: portlet.xml.validate=false
07:14 < topolik:#liferay> oh, no, sorry
07:14 < topolik:#liferay> xml.validation.enabled=false
07:30 < ferrema:#liferay> morning all
07:31 < ferrema:#liferay> have an issue with migration of LF 6.0.6
07:32 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> why is that the code <ui:header title="location" backURL="<%= viewUrl %>" showBackURL="true"/> shows the back url only when i are using http://localhost:8080 and not when i use http://<myip>:8080 ?
07:33 < ferrema:#liferay> we are in a situation where our db is messed up due to an earlier problem in LF 5.2.3 ( https://issues.liferay.com/browse/LPS-5545 )
07:33 < ferrema:#liferay> now I am trying to migrate the checking algo to 6
07:33 < ferrema:#liferay> and hit the problem
07:33 < Mediii:#liferay> topolik:   xml.validation.enabled=false  => It works thank you very much  You just saved my life because the portal server is in Gabon  and customers began to get excited seriously when liferay was turned off
07:34 < ferrema:#liferay> after digging all morning I found that the db has entries that prevent the update operation .
07:34 < ferrema:#liferay> I have stuff in tables like "58'and'6670'='6670"
07:34 < ferrema:#liferay> now ...
07:35 < ferrema:#liferay> is there any chance I can put my hands on a database schema and start doing some cleanups ?
07:59 < hufg:#liferay> where are you going to migrate
07:59 < hufg:#liferay> to which version
08:00 < hufg:#liferay> are you aware that an upgrade is really hard
08:00 < hufg:#liferay> and yes there is always a chance
08:03 < hufg:#liferay> even if you clear this problem it's highly likely that more issues will follow, you have to fix things liferay didn't get right
08:10 < ferrema:#liferay> @huf : I am very well aware of this
08:11 < ferrema:#liferay> we did it from V 5.3.2 to 6.0.6 and it was a pain
08:11 < ferrema:#liferay> but we actually need to upgrade to at least 6.1.x
08:12 < ferrema:#liferay> or we run the risk of our global network management to stop our services ( but this is another story ... )
08:12 < ferrema:#liferay> what I am trying to achieve at the moment is to migrate the checking algorithm from 5 to 6
08:12 < ferrema:#liferay> on liferay 6.0.6
08:12 < hufg:#liferay> mm
08:13 < ferrema:#liferay> this process made me discover that we have a problem on our database
08:13 < ferrema:#liferay> and THIS is what I am trying to solve right now : how do I clean it up ?
08:13 < hufg:#liferay> yeah well if you are sure you are doing the checking algorithm migration right your only choice is to clean the database
08:13 < ferrema:#liferay> yeah
08:13 < hufg:#liferay> i vaguely remember doing something like this
08:13 < hufg:#liferay> there was shit like 1=1 in the db
08:13 < ferrema:#liferay> but I have no idea of the relation between the tables ...
08:14 < hufg:#liferay> like sql injections
08:14 < ferrema:#liferay> yup
08:14 < hufg:#liferay> and it messed up the migration sql query
08:14 < ferrema:#liferay> indeed ! that's exactly what's happening
08:14 < ferrema:#liferay> com.liferay.portal.convert.ConvertException: org.postgresql.util.PSQLException: ERROR: syntax error at or near "and9961"
08:14 < ferrema:#liferay>   Position: 363
08:15 < ferrema:#liferay> i guess it's getting that stuff from resourcecode table
08:15 < ferrema:#liferay> ( the one I am currently seeing messed )
08:16 < ferrema:#liferay> i was wondering if there was a way to get the rows that have nothing to do ( in reality ) with the rest of (say) portlets
08:17 < ferrema:#liferay> i looked at service.xml in portal-impl but i really was not able to decipher it
08:17 < ferrema:#liferay> the diagram looks even scarier ...
08:19 < hufg:#liferay> yees yees i think i did this
08:19 < hufg:#liferay> just look at the db values
08:20 < hufg:#liferay> btw we never migrated
08:20 < ferrema:#liferay> oh
08:20 < hufg:#liferay> just look at the fucked up values and compare to the other values
08:23 < hufg:#liferay> we had invalid values with certain pk values i think
08:23 < hufg:#liferay> like for example values 700-800 were invalid and we deleted that range
08:28 < ferrema:#liferay> ok..
08:28 < ferrema:#liferay> will start doing it
08:28 < ferrema:#liferay> thanks for you help !
08:30 < hufg:#liferay> imo a more feasible migration might be a "partial" migration
08:30 < hufg:#liferay> not sure though hehe
08:33 < ferrema:#liferay> yeah .... but I have no idea how to accomplish that .
08:33 < ferrema:#liferay> first step  : migrate algo
08:33 < ferrema:#liferay> second : check that we can still do everything we did before
08:33 < ferrema:#liferay> third : try to migrate to 6.1.x
08:33 < ferrema:#liferay> ... stuck at step 0 :)

09:44 < x9123:#liferay> Tsts
10:03 < dave_k:#liferay> is it normal in 6.2.0-rc4 that switching from the welcome-theme to the classic theme takes forever to load?
10:05 < dave_k:#liferay> I'm waiting for more than 5 minutes by now ... CPU is at 100% - 200%
10:09 < dave_k:#liferay> okay. now it's done and everything's fast again ...
10:26 -!- mode/#liferay [+o jhf] by ChanServ
12:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> Can someone tell me which session object/scope maps to the equivalent of a user session?
12:54 < jardineworks:#liferay> meaning, if I prefix my attribute with LIFERAY_SHARED_ -- I know that it is accessible in the portlets but with the value be unique PER user session? or will it be shared not just across portlets but across user sessions?
13:19 < jardineworks:#liferay> wait -- that last part was not very well explained. User A logs in and is assinged a token (in a hook). User B signs in and is assigned a separate token. The token should be valid for their entire session and accessible by all portlets. Is that where I use LIFERAY_SHARED_ prefixes?
16:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> is it possible to use the JSONFactoryUtil.deserialize method with custom classes?
16:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> I am trying to do it with a random string but keep getting an exception -- 20:07:41,369 ERROR [http-bio-8080-exec-106][render_portlet_jsp:154] org.json.JSONException: JSONObject["javaClass"] not found.
16:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> but I don't see any way to specify the java class I want to convert it to.
16:23 < npskirk:#liferay> As I recall the JSONObject and JSONArray classes just go back and forth to Strings
16:24 < npskirk:#liferay> It isn't like Grails or Play where the JSON helpers do validation an parsing to other types
16:24 < jardineworks:#liferay> npskirk, right, but the API have a method called deserialize( String json ) that will yield an Object.
16:24 < jardineworks:#liferay> I found instances in the portal source where it does.
16:24 < jardineworks:#liferay> One for the Calendar portlet.
16:24 < npskirk:#liferay> yeah, it gives you back a JSONObject or a JSONArray
16:24 < npskirk:#liferay> then you access the fields through the interface those objects provide
16:25 < jardineworks:#liferay> oh
16:25 < jardineworks:#liferay> really?
16:25 < npskirk:#liferay> ah, well if you have counter-examples, then I'm remembering wrong
16:25 < npskirk:#liferay> been a while
16:25 < jardineworks:#liferay> there is JSONFactoryUtil.createJSONObject(String json) which gives you a JSON object...
16:26 < jardineworks:#liferay> but for example --
16:26 < jardineworks:#liferay> _recurrenceObj = (TZSRecurrence)JSONFactoryUtil.deserialize(
16:26 < jardineworks:#liferay> 					recurrence);
16:26 < jardineworks:#liferay> is in the calendar portlet
16:26 < jardineworks:#liferay> So I assume there is a way to do it.. but I can't find any examples on how to
16:26 < jardineworks:#liferay> Maybe I need to use an external JSON library?
16:30 < npskirk:#liferay> ok .. if you have a JSONObject with a field in it called, say "foo"
16:30 < npskirk:#liferay> then you get the value in "foo" by saying something like jsonObject.getString("foo")
16:32 < npskirk:#liferay> if the thing in "foo" is another JSON Object or JSON array then you get it with  jsonObject.getJSONObject("foo") or jsonObject.getJSONArray("foo")
16:33 < npskirk:#liferay> Assuming you know the field contains a basic java type you can also 'getLong()', 'getDouble()' etc
16:34 < npskirk:#liferay> hmm, the factoryUtil I don't think I've used
16:35 < jardineworks:#liferay> npskirk, sure -- I have all that working but what I want to do is say Person p = (Person)JSONFactoryUtil.deserialize(json); where "name", "age" etc... all get mapped to name, age etc in the Person object.
16:35 < npskirk:#liferay> yeah I get it
16:38 < jardineworks:#liferay> in other frameworks I think you usually speicfy the class you want to deserialize to -- like JSONFactoryUtil.deserialize( Person.class, json )
16:38 < jardineworks:#liferay> but there is no such animal in the LR classes
16:39 < npskirk:#liferay> maybe public static <T> T http://docs.liferay.com/portal/6.1/javadocs/src-html/com/liferay/portal/kernel/json/JSONFactoryUtil.html#line.105(http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/String.html?is-external=true json,
16:39 < npskirk:#liferay>                                          http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/Class.html?is-external=true<T> clazz)
16:39 < npskirk:#liferay> oops
16:40 < jardineworks:#liferay> woah
16:40 < jardineworks:#liferay> lol
16:40 < npskirk:#liferay> there are deserialize methods on JSONFactoryUtil that take a class parameter
16:42 < jardineworks:#liferay> I see one for a String, and one for a JSONObject
16:42 < jardineworks:#liferay> oh
16:42 < jardineworks:#liferay> the looseDeserialize you mean?
16:52 < npskirk:#liferay> yes
16:54 < jardineworks:#liferay> I wish I knew waht looseDeserializeSafe vs looseDeserialize was.
16:55 < npskirk:#liferay> a documented API you mean?
16:56 < npskirk:#liferay> <snicker>
16:56 < jardineworks:#liferay> :)
16:56 < jardineworks:#liferay> you have to love the POC to work with this product :)
16:56 < npskirk:#liferay> use the source Luke
16:58 < jardineworks:#liferay> hahah -- I know. That is what I usually end up doing... checking all the impl classes.
