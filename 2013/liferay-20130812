09:38 < josuebc> Hi there, I just craeted a servlet to handle some REST calls. I was wondering if I could use the Liferay's internal filters to pass the request throug them and handle authentication and then redirect to the correct class/servlet?
09:58 < topolik> Hi josuebc, yes, you should be able to do it, although, authentication is done maybe a bit different than you think
09:59 < topolik> in Liferay 6.1. you can use SecureFilter which works with HTTP basic/digest to authenticate the user
10:00 < topolik> you can use similar configuration as here: http://www.liferay.com/documentation/liferay-portal/6.1/development/-/ai/json-web-services
10:00 < topolik> search for "Secure JSON Web Service Servlet Filter" and add those 2 definitions (<filter> and <filter-mapping>) into your web.xml
10:07 < kiuma> hello ppl
10:09 <@jhf> morning kiuma
10:09 <@jhf> :)
10:10 < kiuma> jhf, do you know why I have a npe when I try to import a web content into another LR installation ?
10:11 <@jhf> hmm
10:11 <@jhf> import, as in using a LAR file?
10:11 < kiuma> yes
10:12 < kiuma> I obtain a journal....lar then import on the other installation
10:12 <@jhf> same version (of Liferay) on both sides right?
10:12 < kiuma> yes 6.1.1 patched
10:12 < kiuma> (same patches of course)
10:12 <@jhf> do you have a stack trace I could look at? it's probably because some reference wasn't properly de-referenced, or something didn't exist on the import that it was expceting.
10:13 <@jhf> unfortunately I've experienced a lot of fragility in export/import.
10:13 < kiuma> me too
10:13 <@jhf> it's going to get a LOT better in 6.2
10:13 <@jhf> you should get involved in the Beta Release Community Program (which begins today, BTW)
10:13 < kiuma> may i post it on priv, pastebin is blocked from here
10:13 <@jhf> part of it is testing out this stuff.
10:14 <@jhf> can you use gist.github.com /
10:14 <@jhf> ?
10:14 < kiuma> I'll push it, and try to involve my collegues if into 6.2 if interested
10:15 < kiuma> may be I can use it
10:15 <@jhf> yeah, that would be awesome.. as an existing user, you may also be interested in the upgrade track. anyway, sign up here: https://docs.google.com/a/liferay.com/forms/d/1TaqSLssMe1F3XY8HXaxRaajyjpwkJPto45iEMp_fVEc/viewform
10:16 <@jhf> or read more about it in my blog (shameless plug): http://www.liferay.com/web/james.falkner/blog/-/blogs/calling-all-stations-liferay-community-beta-program
10:18 < kiuma> Iit seems I cannot use gist
10:19 <@jhf> dang! well you can just email it to me james.falkner@liferay.com
10:19 <@jhf> if you paste it here, you'll get kicked out of the room :)
10:19 <@jhf> there is also pastie.org
10:19 < kiuma> I've a better idea :=
10:19 < kiuma> :D
10:19 <@jhf> uh oh
10:19  * jhf runs for cover
10:21 < kiuma> jhf, http://www.wingstech.it/kiuma/lr/stacktrace.txt
10:21 < kiuma> haha, don't stop me :P
10:23 <@jhf> well, this looks like http://issues.liferay.com/browse/LPS-24442
10:23 <@jhf> when you export, are you only choosing to export web content?
10:23 <@jhf> or, perhaps your web content refers to a journal entry that you don't include in the LAR?
10:25 <@jhf> also do you happen to have dl.file.entry.preview.enabled=false set in your portal-ext.properties? I am looking at a customer issue that had this issue, and removing that from their -ext file made it work.
10:25 < kiuma> well, it seems that follow is selected (grayed) too
10:25 < kiuma> in the importer ?
10:25 < kiuma> let me check
10:26 < kiuma>  cat portal-ext.properties | grep dl.file -> dl.file.max.size=10485760   (only)
10:27 < kiuma> do I have to only choose web content for exporting ?
10:28 <@jhf> yeah, i would try that. this bug appears to be related to document library (now called "Documents and Media")
10:28 <@jhf> so de-selecting it (and/or just choosing Web Content) may resolve it.
10:29 <@jhf> you can also turn on debug during the export, to see if there are warnings like missing files, etc. which might give you additional clue as to what's messing it up.
10:30 < kiuma> ok I try
10:30 <@jhf> to change the log level (before export): control panel->server administration->log levels and change the following log levels to ALL: com.liferay.portal.lar com.liferay.portal.kernel.lar com.liferay.portlet.documentlibrary.lar com.liferay.portlet.journal.lar
10:31 < kiuma> thx
10:31 <@jhf> see if anything looks unusual during export
10:31 < kiuma> export? I thought import
10:31 < kiuma> ok
10:32 <@jhf> well, the problem (in this internal customer report) is that there was a missing file during export, which didn't FAIL the operation, but set itself up for failure during import.
10:33 < kiuma> then the deletion of these entries would possibly solve the npe ?
10:33 <@jhf> yup. that's the hope.
10:33 < kiuma> :)
10:36 < kiuma> do I have to tail catalina.out or liferay.log ?
10:37 < Tar-Minyatur> Oh wow. I think I just found my first Liferay Bug.
10:38 < Tar-Minyatur> @cdn_host@ is being fed from ThemeDisplay.getCDNHost()...which is deprecated, because it's not SSL-aware.
10:39 < kiuma> jhf, his bug appears to be related to document library (now called "Documents and Media")
10:39 < kiuma> <jhf> so de-selecting it (and/or just choosing Web Content) may resolve it.
10:39 < kiuma>  sorry I meant this:
10:40 < kiuma> com.liferay.portal.kernel.repository.RepositoryException: No Repository exists with the primary key 19
10:40 < kiuma> and this No DLContent exists with the key {companyId=10153, repositoryId=85693, path=103, version=1.0}
10:40 <@jhf> that's what you got during export?
10:41 < kiuma> yes
10:41 <@jhf> (with debug turned on)?
10:41 < kiuma> sure
10:41 < kiuma> they are the only two errors
10:42 <@jhf> hmm. one sec.
10:43 < kiuma> mm..... I think I've got it !
10:43 < kiuma> I've the uuid these a line before
10:51 < kiuma> jhf I've something like:
10:52 < kiuma>  INFO  [ajp-bio-8009-exec-2][PortletDataContextListenerImpl:34] Export /groups/10179/portlets/15/articles/cda235dc-74ba-423a-8cf2-55f02aa218ca/1.0/article.xml
10:53 < kiuma> then
10:53 < kiuma> DEBUG [ajp-bio-8009-exec-2][JournalPortletDataHandlerImpl:1597] com.liferay.portal.kernel.repository.RepositoryException: No Repository exists with the primary key 19
10:54 < kiuma> is it possible to manually remove this article from the lar to fix the import ?
10:54 <@jhf> yeah you can do surgery on it, but you also have to remove it from the manifest
10:54 <@jhf> takes a very steady hand
10:54 < kiuma> :)
10:54 <@jhf> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5psNItY-f4
10:55 < kiuma> LOL
10:55 < kiuma> I think you are just old as me then :P
10:55 < kiuma> and to solve the proble at the export root
10:57 < kiuma> where should I inspect it? I opened the xml, checked for <__id> then tried to search in CP for that id but I didn't found anything
10:59 <@jhf> look for the uuid
11:00 <@jhf> the one that showed up in the log
11:00 <@jhf> cda235dc-74ba-423a-8cf2-55f02aa218ca
11:00 <@jhf> look for it in the manifest
11:16 < kiuma> manifest consists on three rows
11:28 < Tar-Minyatur> Does anyone know how Liferay handles dynamic data lists when staging is activated?
11:28 < Tar-Minyatur> Is there something like publishing a ddl?
11:37 < Tar-Minyatur> Oh right. There is a "Dynamic Data List" checkbox in the publishing thingy under Data. Mhm.
11:46 < Tar-Minyatur> Doesn't really work for me...mhm.
11:49 < Tar-Minyatur> I have three DDL portlets on a page. Each one uses a different list view template.
11:49 < Tar-Minyatur> In Staging all three portlets show all three entries of the selected DDL.
11:50 < Tar-Minyatur> When I publish the page to live and select "Dynamic Data Lists" from the Publishing Dialog as well...I end up with a page showing three headlines and nothing else.
11:50 < Tar-Minyatur> So the portlets are there but the content is missing. Any ideas on what I did wrong?
12:04 < kiuma> jhf, thanks for helping, fixing lr exporter (deleting broken articles) fixed import
12:04 <@jhf> yay!!!
12:05 < Tar-Minyatur> Ugh. My custom templates output nothing, but the default template says "No records were found.". So...my DDL never made it to live. What the... Oo
12:05 <@jhf> nice work. I really would value your feedback on 6.2 if you have a chance, especially if you could test it with your broken articles :)
12:10 < Tar-Minyatur> jhf: You don't have by any chance any knowledge about a hidden button that will make my problem go away, do you?
12:11 <@jhf> heheh.. did you check off DDL when setting up staging?
12:11 <@jhf> err.. check "on" (meaning, checked)
12:11 < Tar-Minyatur> Yes.
12:11 < Tar-Minyatur> Several times.
12:11 <@jhf> and when you published to live, did you ensure that the checkbox was checked?
12:11 < Tar-Minyatur> I even selected "All" in the Range selection to make sure nothing is left behind.
12:12 <@jhf> ok so what didn't survive the publish.. the DDL itself, or its *records* only?
12:12 <@jhf> or both
12:12 < Tar-Minyatur> Looks like the records.
12:12 < Tar-Minyatur> Because the headline is correct.
12:12 <@jhf> hmmm
12:12 < Tar-Minyatur> It shows the name of the DDL.
12:13 < Tar-Minyatur> On all three portlets.
12:13 < Tar-Minyatur> I can even access the custom templates from live when I enable the controls.
12:13 <@jhf> so you added the records on the "staging" side, then tried to publish to live?
12:13 < Tar-Minyatur> And they survived the publishing as well.
12:13 < Tar-Minyatur> Dunno. Is there even something like a staging side for DDLs?
12:13 < Tar-Minyatur> I edited the DDLs only from the CP.
12:13 <@jhf> yeah thats what I'm thinking - I don't think there is.
12:13 < Tar-Minyatur> Not from the frontend.
12:14 <@jhf> for example, if you add a blog post on the 'staging' side it goes 'live' immediately. its data isn't staged AFAIK
12:14 < Tar-Minyatur> Yeah. Because there is this "Draft" feature.
12:14 < Tar-Minyatur> You can only go "Save as Draft" or "Publish".
12:14 <@jhf> looking at http://issues.liferay.com/browse/LPS-28982
12:15 < Tar-Minyatur> That sounds odd. Oo
12:15 < Tar-Minyatur> Especially because I can't see any way to publish the records separately.
12:16 <@jhf> apparently that's the design - when you added the records you must have selected the 'staging' scope. there's that little drop down in control panel on the left that lets you pick the context in which you're working.
12:16 <@jhf> if you go there, do you see a staged and non-staged version of your site in the drop down?
12:17 < Tar-Minyatur> I can't see anything like that there.
12:17 < Tar-Minyatur> It's just the form for the record. Nothing else.
12:17 <@jhf> yeah. I'm thinking that control panel forces you to be in the "staged" context when using CP
12:18 <@jhf> if you add a record while visiting the "live" site itself, does it publish correctly?
12:18 <@jhf> (this requires that you have a DDL display portlet on the site so that you can add a record from the site itself, rather than CP)
12:18 < Tar-Minyatur> No idea. The portlets are not meant to be editable.
12:18 < Tar-Minyatur> I'll try though.
12:19 < Tar-Minyatur> Yeah. That shows up.
12:19 < Tar-Minyatur> Omg.
12:19 < Tar-Minyatur> So every DDL has two separate lives.
12:19 <@jhf> ok. from reading that bug, this is the intended design, and the ability to even add records from CP (when on a staged site) has been disabled.
12:19 <@jhf> starting in the next release :)
12:20 <@jhf> (and in the upcoming 6.1 CE/EE release, which btw is imminent)
12:20 < Tar-Minyatur> I guess DDLs are intended for different things than what we use them for.
12:20 < Tar-Minyatur> We use them to manage lists of products and their properties.
12:20 < Tar-Minyatur> To show different subsets of them on different pages.
12:21 < Tar-Minyatur> Apparently they have been designed to collect data from users.
12:21 < Tar-Minyatur> That's definitely annoying to the extreme.
12:21 <@jhf> yeah.. it's designed for "power users" who want to create fancy lists
12:22 <@jhf> haha
12:22 <@jhf> someone filed a bug saying that their "add record" button disappeared on staging site: http://issues.liferay.com/browse/LPS-30788
12:22 < Tar-Minyatur> A little more than a week and I already start to hate Liferay...
12:23 <@jhf> awwww that's no bueno.
12:23 <@jhf> you should keep issues.liferay.com handy
12:23 < Tar-Minyatur> This is impossible.
12:24 < Tar-Minyatur> Now I need to find a way to copy DDLs from staging to live.
12:24 < Tar-Minyatur> Which will probably require some serious hook development...
12:24 < Tar-Minyatur> And I need to find a new approach to editing the DDLs, because they will f***ing remove the functionality from the CP?
12:24 < Tar-Minyatur> What the hell... -.-
12:25 <@jhf> you could have a DDL form entry portlet on the site in a restricted area
12:26 <@jhf> and not rely on CP (which can be overwhelming for non-admin types)
12:26 < Tar-Minyatur> Yeah. But we use staging to preview the changes.
12:26 <@jhf> ahh..
12:26 <@jhf> hmmm
12:27 < Tar-Minyatur> So some poor guy would have to edit the DDL first in staging and then in live.
12:27 < Tar-Minyatur> AND there are some hooks that change the way the edit form in the CP behaves.
12:27 < Tar-Minyatur> Because the product DDL records actually are assigned a record in another DDL.
12:27 < Tar-Minyatur> (Please do not ask me why...)
12:29 <@jhf> when you create a DDL record via the CP, but *before* you "publish to live", are the records themselves already "live"?
12:30 <@jhf> or are they only on the staging site? other portlets (like blogs, etc) no matter where you create "records" (blog posts), they are always "live"
12:30 <@jhf> I'm wondering if they are indeed live, and then when you "publish to live" they get wiped out
12:30 <@jhf> or are they never live in the first place
12:30 < Tar-Minyatur> Mhm. No idea.
12:31 < Tar-Minyatur> And I can't see a way to check that.
12:31 <@jhf> well, just add a record and check the live site and see if your template (or the default one) "sees" it
12:31 < Tar-Minyatur> When I added the portlets and the DDLs and published the page without checking DDLs in the publish dialog, nothing showed up in the portlets.
12:31 < Tar-Minyatur> So the DDLs were not there, I'd say.
12:32 <@jhf> perhaps, or it just zero'd it because of the way the DDL system interacts with staging.
12:32 < Tar-Minyatur> I can't even see the newly added entry in the CP.
12:32 < Tar-Minyatur> The one I added from live, I mean.
12:33 <@jhf> I believe any time you use CP you are using the "staging" environment, not the live one. I may have to fire up my 6.1 and test this out.
12:33 < Tar-Minyatur> Adding something in the CP doesn't change anything for live.
12:33 <@jhf> in fact yes, I will do that.
12:33 < Tar-Minyatur> Well...that's the whole idea of having a staging area, isn't it?
12:33 < Tar-Minyatur> To have a buffer before anything goes live.
12:35 < Tar-Minyatur> DDLs are a new feature in 6.0, right?
12:35 <@jhf> yes in general it's a buffer, for typical admin/developer-controlled content, BUT typical user-entered data isn't considered to be something one would normally stage, from Liferay's perspective.
12:36 < Tar-Minyatur> Like blog entries etc...I agree with that.
12:36 < Tar-Minyatur> We don't have dynamic content like this, however.
12:36 < Tar-Minyatur> Everything is controlled by the content guys.
12:37 < Tar-Minyatur> And they prefer to have a way of checking what they are doing BEFORE it goes live.
12:37 < Tar-Minyatur> Because by that time probably 1000 people would have seen it, even before they realized their mistake themselves.
12:38 < Tar-Minyatur> Maybe we have to say goodbye to the staging feature and build another environment for that, from where we only push the database to the live environment. Or something like that.
12:38 < Tar-Minyatur> Ugh. This will be annoying. -.-
12:38 < Tar-Minyatur> If people would only stop using new features they don't really understand. And then call for help and leave me with their mess...
12:39 <@jhf> ugh.. yeah I hear ya.. yeah the more I read about the issue, the more I am convinced this was a design decision and not well documented - here's a note from one of the developers:
12:39 <@jhf>  I think it works well because in this way we can separate the definition preparation and the actual data creation with staging.
12:39 <@jhf> The current use case is the following:
12:39 <@jhf> on the staging site the admin prepares the environment with definitions and list
12:39 <@jhf> publish
12:39 <@jhf> portal users can create the new records based on the prepared environment
12:40 < Tar-Minyatur> Yeah. Sounds like Liferay is very focused on user-generated content.
12:40 <@jhf> i don't think it would be rocket-scientist-hard to write a tool to export from staging and into live (the records I mean)
12:41 < Tar-Minyatur> Implementing something like "move DDL from stating to live" can't be that hard...
12:41 <@jhf> staged environments are nothing more than sites with different IDs but otherwise look identical and the APIs work the same.
12:41 <@jhf> so you can getAllRecords(stagingId) and putAllRecords(liveId) :)
12:41 <@jhf> the rest is left to the reader...
12:41 < Tar-Minyatur> Yeah. I guess I'll have to look into that.
12:42 < Tar-Minyatur> And then I can start digging around trying to create a hook to revert those upcoming changes to the CP.
12:42 < Tar-Minyatur> Because I bet at some point somebody will cry for an update, because having the newest version is considered to be cool...
12:43 < Tar-Minyatur> I wonder...what would be the right approach by Liferay's standards to create a database of products and have them easily available for content editors to be embedded into any page?
12:44 < Tar-Minyatur> Web contents for every single product?
12:44 < Tar-Minyatur> Especially considering that every product has a teaser and a details page.
12:44 <@jhf> hmm
12:44 < Tar-Minyatur> By using DDLs we have that all in one.
12:45 < Tar-Minyatur> Using web contents we would have to create two web contents for everything...and build pages for everything...and ugh.
12:45 < Tar-Minyatur> So disgusting.
12:45 <@jhf> well you can achieve the same with a web content structure (akin to a ddl definition), a web content template (akin to a ddl template), then use asset publisher to publish them (akin to the ddl display portlet)
12:45 <@jhf> no you would only need one article for each product.
12:45 <@jhf> and can use asset publisher to publish them in bulk, based on filtering/etc
12:46 < Tar-Minyatur> But I still would need to have a details page for every product.
12:46 < Tar-Minyatur> Or write some fancy dynamic template thingy and work with a GET parameter to retrieve the corresponding web content.
12:47 <@jhf> so there are a couple of ways to do that without the fancy pants stuff
12:47 <@jhf> if you have 1 article per product, then use asset publisher to show a list of them - when you click on one, asset publisher can "maximize" view and show the full details of that one thing.
12:48 <@jhf> the other option is to have a completely separate page, and use asset publisher's ability to define a "display page" - meaning, a different page that you are sent to when you click on an item, and that page can have a whole different layout, with a single "web content display" portlet that would show the item clicked from the pervious page.
12:50 <@jhf> see http://www.liferay.com/documentation/liferay-portal/6.1/user-guide/-/ai/lp-6-1-ugen03-display-settings-0 and the description of the "Asset LInk behavior" and the "Display Page" section below it
13:02 < jardineworks> jhf, can I pm you for a minute?
13:03 <@jhf> sure
14:02 < Tar-Minyatur> jhf, Thanks for the input. Was driving home. Sorry for the delay.
14:03 <@jhf> no worries.. from how you describe it, DDLs aren't the "best fit" for your use case :) I think web content + asset publisher is a better way to go.
14:04 < Tar-Minyatur> Yeah. I wish those guys would have asked you before messing up like this and getting a whole ton of money for it...
14:05 <@jhf> ugh.. sorry to hear that :(
14:05 < Tar-Minyatur> So I guess I'll at some point try to find a way to create web contents from the DDLs.
14:05 <@jhf> how many records are you talking about, btw?
14:06 < Tar-Minyatur> About 200 or something, I think.
14:07 < Tar-Minyatur> As everything is stored in the DB, it should be possible to convert it somehow.
14:07 < Tar-Minyatur> Will be messy, but what can you do...
14:07 < Tar-Minyatur> I wonder if this weird custom image uploader will be a problem.
14:08 <@jhf> oh yeah.. you could write some code (and it would be relatively short) to use the Liferay APIs to extract each record, then in turn create an article for it.
14:08 < Tar-Minyatur> I'd almost expect it to.
14:08 < Tar-Minyatur> Oh. Using the Liferay APIs wasn't even on my mind.
14:08 < Tar-Minyatur> Still new to the whole thing.
14:08 < Tar-Minyatur> That's probably the much better way.
14:08 <@jhf> it would be easy. in fact I already have the APIs for creating new articles for ya in a past blog.
14:09 < Tar-Minyatur> When you say articles you mean web content, right?
14:09 <@jhf> yeah.. web content articles.
14:09 < Tar-Minyatur> Okay.
14:09 < Tar-Minyatur> Everybody at the office just calls it web content.
14:09 <@jhf> are you familiar with the concepts of structures and templates when working with web content?
14:10 < Tar-Minyatur> Yeah.
14:10 < Tar-Minyatur> It's pretty straight forward.
14:10 < Tar-Minyatur> And one of the nicer concepts I've seen so far.
14:10 < Tar-Minyatur> Although I miss some features like defining custom types.
14:10 <@jhf> yeah. and actually for your purposes, you can create the structure and template once. then just grab all the records, and create an article for each.
14:11 < Tar-Minyatur> Yeah.
14:11 < Tar-Minyatur> Will actually be easier to maintain than DDLs, I think.
14:11 < Tar-Minyatur> The whole nested dialog thing going on for DDLs is annoying as hell, I think.
14:11 <@jhf> so here's the blog I was talking about: http://www.liferay.com/web/james.falkner/blog/-/blogs/7cogs-is-dead-long-live-7cogs-
14:11 <@jhf> there are a bunch of code snippets in there showing how to use LR APIs to make stuff programmatically
14:12 <@jhf> there's also part II which has more snippets you may find useful: http://www.liferay.com/web/james.falkner/blog/-/blogs/part-ii-7cogs-is-dead-long-live-7cogs-
14:12 < Tar-Minyatur> Nice, thanks. Something to start the day off tomorrow. ;)
14:12 <@jhf> these are used to programmatically create various things (like users, blogs, WCM articles, addresses, friend requests, all sorts of stuff)
14:14 < Tar-Minyatur> I wonder if I'll be able to convince people of this drastic change...
14:14 < Tar-Minyatur> I have no clue who came up with the idea of using everything like that...
14:14 <@jhf> yeah.. well you should play with asset publisher and its ability to redirect (link behavior) and prototype it.
14:14 <@jhf> if u get stuck, we are here (collectively)
14:14 < Tar-Minyatur> Sounds simple enough. So far all my prototyping worked out nicely.
14:15 < Tar-Minyatur> I even managed to load an article from a template today.
14:15 < Tar-Minyatur> Because that's something they really really want to do...
14:15 <@jhf> nice!
14:15 < Tar-Minyatur> As if entering a content ID into a form is user friendly...
14:15 <@jhf> in control panel, you can view all web content articles that are assigned to a given template
14:16 <@jhf> … I think. I know you can for structures. gonna check on that real quick.
14:16 < Tar-Minyatur> Even if you can
14:16 < Tar-Minyatur> Argh...connection...wake up.
14:16 <@jhf> yup you can
14:16 <@jhf> control panel -> web content -> templates
14:16 <@jhf> next to the template -> Action -> "View Web Content"
14:17 < Tar-Minyatur> Yeah. I
14:17 < Tar-Minyatur> *gna*
14:17 <@jhf> ah you want to do it programmatically so you can do stuff with the articles
14:17 < Tar-Minyatur> I remember that.
14:17 <@jhf> yeah what I do is find the GUI that does what I need, then look at its JSP code and steal stuff :)
14:17 < Tar-Minyatur> Yeah. Exactly.
14:18 < Tar-Minyatur> Hehe.
14:18 <@jhf> hurray for open source!
14:18 < Tar-Minyatur> I'm still trying to figure out what kind of modding those guys did.
14:19 < Tar-Minyatur> Because there are some things in the CP that I can't imagine Liferay having by default.
14:19 < Tar-Minyatur> But I couldn't find any hooks either. So I guess they modded the core. -.-
14:20 <@jhf> omg I curse the person that made this spreadsheet horizontally-oriented with huge, wide columns.
14:20 <@jhf> scrolling is giving me a headache
14:20 <@jhf> it's lurching from column to column and I keep losing my place
14:20 < Tar-Minyatur> Yeah.
14:20 < Tar-Minyatur> Been there. ;)
14:21 <@jhf> gonna load it into excel and swap cols for rows
14:21 <@jhf> because this is BULL HONKEY
14:22 < Tar-Minyatur> It's funny to watch the content guys enter new products into the ddls.
14:22 < Tar-Minyatur> There are actually like 40 fields or something in the structure.
14:22 < Tar-Minyatur> It makes for horrible usability in the CP.
14:24 < Tar-Minyatur> So I guess technically it's a good idea to remove that from the CP.
14:24 < Tar-Minyatur> But introducing a feature and then removing it usually ends badly.
14:24 <@jhf> well with the WCM-based solution, you can use CP, but it's also possible through the asset publisher portlet to add a new "record"
14:25 <@jhf> and you can provide tooltips for the fields as well.
14:25 <@jhf> and they can be localized!
14:25 <@jhf> and the articles are properly versioned!
14:26 <@jhf> and can also optionally be workflow'd!
14:26 < Tar-Minyatur> Localization is something I'd like to disable. ;D
14:26 <@jhf> the possibilities are endless!!
14:26 < Tar-Minyatur> Clutters up the whole CP, if you don't need it.
14:26 < Tar-Minyatur> Yeah. I'm not entirely sure Liferay was a sane choice.
14:26 < Tar-Minyatur> Most of the features are not needed.
14:26 <@jhf> blasphemy!
14:26 < Tar-Minyatur> And for the stuff they actually had to include they chose weird workarounds and stuff.
14:27 <@jhf> liferay can be use for everything and anything.
14:27 <@jhf> ;-)
14:27 < Tar-Minyatur> Sure. So can Wordpress. ;D
14:27 <@jhf> ouch.. that cut deep, Tar-Minyatur, real deep
14:27 < Tar-Minyatur> *lol*
14:27 < Tar-Minyatur> I can really see Liferay's potential.
14:27 < Tar-Minyatur> It just requires a deep understanding of the features BEFORE you start working with it.
14:28 < Tar-Minyatur> End even more so BEFORE you start customizing it programmatically.
14:28 < Tar-Minyatur> *And
14:28 <@jhf> yeah.. agreed.
14:28 < Tar-Minyatur> And when time is short, apparently the results can be quite bad. And then people like me have to clean up the mess. ;)
14:28 <@jhf> you should charge double for cleanup
14:29 < Tar-Minyatur> I'm employed, not freelancing. Can't charge anything. ;)
14:30 <@jhf> ok well if you can't get more money, at least you can double up on the "sigh"ing and grumbling about your predecessors.
14:30 <@jhf> nothing says "team player" more than being a complainer
14:30 < Tar-Minyatur> :D
14:30 < Tar-Minyatur> There will be another new developer next month.
14:30 <@jhf> also, bonus: if you screw it up, you can always blame the last guy
14:30 < Tar-Minyatur> Then we can at least grumble together. ;)
14:31 < Tar-Minyatur> The guys who messed that up are still around and "maintaining" their code.
14:31 < Tar-Minyatur> I'm just working "in the background" at the moment.
14:31 < Tar-Minyatur> Mainly evaluating and trying to make some sense of it.
14:32 < Tar-Minyatur> Until a new solution is available, they don't dare to send them to hell.
14:33 < Tar-Minyatur> By now I should be used to IT projects going very badly...but the sheer extend to which projects can be messed up still amazes me.
14:35 < Tar-Minyatur> And the worst part is that people actually make money that way...nobody would pay a carpenter who builds a crooked table...
14:35 < Tar-Minyatur> But anyway. I'm supposed to relax and reload my batteries for tomorrow. ;)
14:36 < Tar-Minyatur> So thanks again for the chat, the ideas, the knowledge and so on.
14:36 < Tar-Minyatur> I'll probably be back grumbling tomorrow. ;)
17:02 < jardineworks> does anyone know if the workflow designer is still an EE only thing?
17:07 < npskirk> For 6.1 I believe that is true
17:07 < npskirk> dunno if 6.2 will be the same
17:22 < jardineworks> npskirk, that sucks. Writing Xml is PAINFUL.
17:22 < npskirk> truly
17:22 < npskirk> You could write it with a groovy xml builder...
17:22 < npskirk> takes some of the pain out
17:25 < jardineworks> npskirk, interesting. Haven't see that.. maybe I'll do that. I was going to try to convince the client that it makes more sense to have a one approver workflow and someone competent making the approvals but the groovy solution might be easier :)
17:26 < npskirk> @jardineworks Well, it adds a build step to generate the XML, but at least you don't have to look at pointy brackets
17:30 < npskirk> @jardineworks Also, be careful.  Groovy tends to end any love you still hold for java.
17:31 < jardineworks> npskirk, I see that -- it was already starting to drift towards Scala... this might prove to be the end of Java :)
