02:39 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> does anyone know how to use aui:script to use multiple modules?
03:14 < hufg:#liferay> helloo any one with any knowledge of the permissions system?
03:17 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> avinashrbhat: You mean with the "use" attribute?
03:20 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> yeah exactly
03:20 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> do we have to give it comma separated?
03:20 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Have you tried with a comma-separated list?
03:20 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> ;)
03:39 < bijoo_alias:#liferay> hufg: hey there buddy; just ask; don't ask to ask.
03:40 < bijoo_alias:#liferay> someone may see the question and answer; else what do you have to lose by asking...
03:46 < hufg:#liferay> 8/
03:47 < hufg:#liferay> it's a tricky question and needs a lengthy discussion
03:47 < bijoo_alias:#liferay> okay; want to ask the tricky question?
03:48 < hufg:#liferay> yes yes
03:49 < hufg:#liferay> https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/blob/6.1.2-ga3/portal-impl/src/com/liferay/portal/staging/permission/StagingPermissionImpl.java#L68 what is the rationale behind that method and why it's called during publish
03:50 < hufg:#liferay> the problem here seems to be that in our GA2 installation that perhaps the method call shouldn't happen in the first place or the groupId and actionId combination is wrong
03:50 < hufg:#liferay> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/281bf6b594affd4f69a2
03:51 < hufg:#liferay> this is the problem during publish
03:51 < hufg:#liferay> with local live
03:52 < hufg:#liferay> we have had it fail on UPDATE and OVERRIDE_CHECKOUT actions
03:52 < hufg:#liferay> and it seems impossible to replicate those actions with livegroup in GA3 bundle
03:53 < bijoo_alias:#liferay> Okay; so what I'll do is recreate; can you tell me steps for a simple case?
03:53 < bijoo_alias:#liferay> E.g. start staging in portal; create/publish article A; then try to update; get the error?
03:54 < bijoo_alias:#liferay> E.g. 1.start staging in portal; 2.create/publish article A; 3.then try to update; 4.get the error?
03:54 < hufg:#liferay> no i can't because this problem came in 6.1.1 ce GA2 --> GA3 6.1.2 ce upgrade
03:54 < hufg:#liferay> we are working on creating a reproducable case
03:55 < hufg:#liferay> only this day though
03:56 < hufg:#liferay> not enough time hehe
03:56 < bijoo_alias:#liferay> So maybe need a step like; E.g. 1. setup GA2 instance; 2. enable staging; 3. add article A and publish; 4. upgrade to GA3; 5. try to update article A; 6. get error?
03:56 < hufg:#liferay> yes yes perhaps
03:58 < bijoo_alias:#liferay> hufg: okay; I can't spend that much time right now. I'll check the chat logs to help tomorrow.
03:58 < hufg:#liferay> np
03:59 < bijoo_alias:#liferay> hufg: have you tried 1. create new site, 2. enable staging, 3. create/publish Article B, 4. update Article B?
03:59 < hufg:#liferay> yes
03:59 < hufg:#liferay> i've been trying to replicate it with GA3 bundle
04:00 < hufg:#liferay> to see if the upgrade had 0 to do with this issue
04:00 < bijoo_alias:#liferay> no luck? well, that may be good thing, correct?
04:00 < bijoo_alias:#liferay> you can archive/restore the site this way;
04:00 < bijoo_alias:#liferay> of course, backup the DB before that.
04:00 < bijoo_alias:#liferay> So if VM, best to clone the VM.
04:01 < bijoo_alias:#liferay> Gotta jet; talk to you later hufg
04:01 < hufg:#liferay> okok
04:05 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, that worked, although I got another question too, how to use an external js file? like in `src` attribute in script tag?
04:06 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> i'm asking this coz eclipse is throwing weird errors when i use auiLscript
04:06 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> * aui:script
04:09 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> http://pastie.org/private/a10mskfhi0zsldqqxvrn4q
04:09 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> that is the snippet that is offending eclipse
04:27 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Is there a specific reason why you chose AUI there instead of just plain HTML?
05:14 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> seems that it has better looks and natural forms. for my employer these things are priority.
06:19 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> But there is no style for scripts. ;)
06:19 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> So it probably doesn't matter if you use aui for that or not.
06:21 < sm`:#liferay> hellou
06:24 < sm`:#liferay> im getting a ClassNotFoundException poiting to a view.jsp file in a portlet
06:26 < sm`:#liferay> here's some of the code
06:26 < sm`:#liferay> http://pastebin.com/srM89nLQ
06:27 < sm`:#liferay> im basically using one clas 'AnnualSurvey' and it there in the pkg
07:21 < hufg:#liferay> uhuh whats the ce 6.1.2 ga3 db upgrade package?

08:05 < hufg:#liferay> http://issues.liferay.com/browse/LPS-40416
08:05 < hufg:#liferay> there you have it
08:05 < hufg:#liferay> rotty3000:
08:16 < hufg:#liferay> feels good
08:16 < hufg:#liferay> to have some closure on this '
08:42 < hufg:#liferay> and this one http://issues.liferay.com/browse/LPS-40418
08:42 < hufg:#liferay> here is our contribution to the CE 6.1 GA2 -> GA3 upgrade process which is a no go for us
08:53 < hufg:#liferay> and the my places portlet is probably broken in GA3
08:53 < hufg:#liferay> links to localhost
08:54 < hufg:#liferay> impossible to test with a  bundle but use a real server with GA3 installed and you'll see it
08:54 < hufg:#liferay> setting virtualhost will hide it
08:54 < hufg:#liferay> works properly then
09:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> good morning
09:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> I have an easy one for all of you -- long week I suppose since I can't for the life of me understand.
09:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> unless it is the default landing page...
09:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> I deleted the what-we-do page... and now everything time I go to the portal I get a 404 because there is no page at that url.
09:11 < hufg:#liferay> ahh hasn't been a great week with the upgrade
09:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> hufg, sound like it. At least you managed a small Friday victory though :)
09:12 < hufg:#liferay> yeah it's great 8)
09:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> you definitely earned your beer bash :)
09:15 < hufg:#liferay> hehe
09:16 < hufg:#liferay> i wish they would release patches !
09:17 < jardineworks:#liferay> they do... open up your wallet :)
09:20 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Damn.
09:20 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Oh...and hi. ;)
09:20 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I think we can't really use ServiceBuilder. I need additional fields in the relation tables. Mhm.
09:21 < hufg:#liferay> jardineworks: we once opened but nothing happened
09:21 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Oh wait. *lol* Stupid. No we don't.
09:21 < hufg:#liferay> thus community edition
09:21 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Forget I even came in here. :D
09:22 < hufg:#liferay> :)
09:23 < jardineworks:#liferay> hufg, I had the luxury once of working with EE -- it was a wsrp implementation and we got LOTS of patches :)
09:23 < hufg:#liferay> mm
09:23 < jardineworks:#liferay> which in a way can be worse.
09:25 < hufg:#liferay> i think the patches we needed were too expensive
09:26 < hufg:#liferay> remote publish isn't still working i hear
09:26 < hufg:#liferay> they have a 1m liferay project running here which ended up implementing custom publishing
09:26 < hufg:#liferay> they aim to have it in a few years or so
09:27 < hufg:#liferay> not sure what was the problem
09:28 < hufg:#liferay> we have had a custom implementation also
09:28 < hufg:#liferay> publishing implementation
09:29 < hufg:#liferay> 3min into weekend
09:29 < hufg:#liferay> goodbye liferay
09:29 < hufg:#liferay> for now
09:32 < hufg:#liferay> have a nice a weekend!
09:56 -!- mode/#liferay [+o rotty3000] by ChanServ
11:02 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> for usage in ServiceBuilder what datatype should i use for longtext SQL type?
11:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> how big is a long text type?
11:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> I would assume "text" is the SB type

11:54 < jardineworks:#liferay> rotty3000, jhf are you guys around ... I have a SORT of liferay issue that several people have tried to help me with and I have had no success. I am wondering if one of you might know?
11:59 <@rotty3000:#liferay> jardineworks: I can try
11:59 < jardineworks:#liferay> rotty3000, jhf -- this is a logging issue. I have 3 jars client-xxx.jar. I have placed these jars in TOMCAT_HOME/lib/ext. Restarted the portal. All my plugins leverage these jars because they provide an integration framework with my clients systems. The jars all use JULI logging.
11:59 < jardineworks:#liferay> Issue is -- my logging never shows up and I can't figure out why
12:00 < jardineworks:#liferay> the JARS are loaded by the Common classloader (based on catalina.properties config in /conf)
12:00 < jardineworks:#liferay> so the configuration should be in /conf/logging.properties right?
12:01 <@jhf:#liferay> did you rtfm :) http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-6.0-doc/logging.html
12:01 <@jhf:#liferay> oh dang thats 6.0
12:01 <@jhf:#liferay> http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/logging.html
12:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, I did -- that's how I figured out the clas loader was common :)
12:02 <@jhf:#liferay> hahah
12:02 <@jhf:#liferay> ok.
12:02 <@jhf:#liferay> there is nothing special that I know of that one would need to do to make a class loaded by the system/tomcat class loader to be able to emit stuff to the log file using juli
12:02 <@rotty3000:#liferay> are you sure the logging is not going to a specific appender you don't happen to be looking at?
12:02 < jardineworks:#liferay> for a while i was getting an error that no appenders were configured.. but that seems to have gone away when I added something to the ROOT/WEB-INF/classes/logging.properties
12:03 < jardineworks:#liferay> here is the entry I added --
12:03 < jardineworks:#liferay> #com.mercatus.service.MercatusService.handlers = java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler
12:03 < jardineworks:#liferay> #com.mercatus.service.MercatusService.level = INFO
12:03 < jardineworks:#liferay> hmmm
12:03 <@rotty3000:#liferay> but the loggers in the common classloader won't see that config I don't think
12:03 < jardineworks:#liferay> I am tailing the log
12:03 < jardineworks:#liferay> rotty3000, right good point
12:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> that would be used if I put the jars in ROOT/WEB-INF/lib I guess
12:09 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Nice. I just got an email that my boss handed in the necessary form that might make DevCon a reality for me. ;)
12:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> moved it to the logging.properties under conf/ but that doesn't seem to have helped.
12:09 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> And hi btw. ;D
12:10 <@jhf:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur: cool!!
12:10 <@jhf:#liferay> does your nickname have something to do with either a dinosaur or some mythical horrible creature?
12:10 <@jhf:#liferay> it sounds like it
12:11 <@jhf:#liferay> also, be sure to arrive on oct 8 if possible, for the unconference
12:11 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Mythical...mhm. Sort of. If Tolkien's works have finally reached this stage.
12:11 <@jhf:#liferay> ah yes
12:11 <@jhf:#liferay> I am a superficial tolkien fan. I'm sorry.
12:11 <@jhf:#liferay> i..e I've seen the movie but never read the books.
12:11 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur is the "king's name" of Elros, Elrond's half-brother. ;)
12:11 <@jhf:#liferay> and think peter jackson is pretty cool
12:12 <@jhf:#liferay> :) again, sorry :)
12:12 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> And I actually just picked the name ages ago from a book with illustrations about Tolkien's figures...just because it looked nice. :D
12:12 <@jhf:#liferay> does it help that I actually visited the Weta workshop and toured some of the filming locations in NZ?
12:12 <@jhf:#liferay> ah
12:13 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Knowing only the movies, is sort of ok. Although you miss out on some parts that are very cool. :)
12:13 <@jhf:#liferay> (it was a side trip from a company-paid biz trip, pre-Liferay)
12:13 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah I know.. I want to read them. it's just intimidating look at all those pages.
12:13 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I'm still grumpy that Tom Bombadil was not part of the movies.
12:13 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Well...get the three books edition. :D
12:13 <@jhf:#liferay> I've heard the proper way is to read all 5
12:14 <@jhf:#liferay> or is there more?
12:14 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> There actually are only three books to Lord of the Rings.
12:14 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> There is however the Hobbit as sort of a...introduction to the world of Tolkien.
12:14 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> And the Silmarillion, which I never finished...way too hard. ;D
12:15 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Oh and concerning the Unconference...probably not going to happen. We're in a project with only 8 weeks dev time and even giving me 2 days will still require a lot of convincing...
12:16 <@jhf:#liferay> dang. we're also having a community meet up the evening of oct 8 https://www.liferay.com/web/olaf.kock/blog/-/blogs/devcon-2013-filling-up-quickly-unconference-alert-community-meeting-announcement
12:17 <@jhf:#liferay> rotty3000: when do u arrive?
12:18 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I could walk to the Ampelmann restaurant. ;)
12:20 <@rotty3000:#liferay> jhf, arriving monday
12:20 <@jhf:#liferay> oh you're in Berlin.. so you have no excuses then.
12:21 <@jhf:#liferay> at least for the meetup!
12:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> :(
12:23 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> jardineworks: It's hard to watch from afar. I know the feeling. First time a relevant conference is near enough for me to attend. And I still have to hope it will happen.
12:23 < jardineworks:#liferay> lol -- I'm frowny facing my logging :)
12:23 < jardineworks:#liferay> tomcat hates me
12:24 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Oh well. The context got me there. ;D
12:24 < jardineworks:#liferay> hah... terrible.
12:25 < jardineworks:#liferay> if I  put my jars with my plugins, I see everything. But I don't want to bundle them with my plugins ... all of the plugins need to use them so I think it makes more sense for them to be global.
12:38 <@rotty3000:#liferay> juli has always been a pain to configure
12:39 < jardineworks:#liferay> I just can't get it to work
12:39 < jardineworks:#liferay> I was using Log4j before for these classes but it would not work either, so I swapped it for JULI assuming that it would work based on tomcat config
12:39 < jardineworks:#liferay> but the only way I can see anything is with sysout!
12:41 < jardineworks:#liferay> to hell with it. I'm just going to bundle the jars. This is a waste of time.
12:41 < jardineworks:#liferay> at this point I'm just guessing. I have no idea how to even troubleshoot this.
12:55 <@rotty3000:#liferay> hey jarding
12:55 <@rotty3000:#liferay> jardineworks:
12:55 <@rotty3000:#liferay> why not take a minute or two to debug what juli is doing with the log records
12:56 <@rotty3000:#liferay> get the source for your version of tomcat, and include it as a source lookup from your IDE
12:56 <@rotty3000:#liferay> then just debug into the log calls
14:43 < jardineworks:#liferay> rotty3000, I will when I have more time. I'm a little behind schedule as it is though with this project so I need to get moving. It'll be easier for me to just modify the ant target so that my jars are copied into the WEB-INF/lib folder of my plugins before deployment.
14:43 <@rotty3000:#liferay> cool
14:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> rotty3000, I will try that though becuase it is bugging me why its not working.
