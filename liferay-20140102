09:23 < hufg-:#liferay> hello hello whats up?
09:34 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey hufg happy new year!
09:41 < hufg-:#liferay> thanks man happy new y√©ar to you too \o/
10:07 < webczat:#liferay> Hello.
10:08 < webczat:#liferay> I'm a blind user and have the following question: is it at all possible for me to lay out webpages without using the mouse?
10:24 <@jhf:#liferay> webczat: yes, it is possible without using the mouse, but it is highly dependent on your browser and its interaction with your operating system (w/r/t keyboard shortcuts)
10:24 < webczat:#liferay> how to do this?
10:25 <@jhf:#liferay> since Liferay's user interface is 99% through the browser, all of its interfaces are standard components (for example, you can press the tab button to cycle through input fields, etC)
10:25 <@jhf:#liferay> you interact with Liferay in the same way you interact with any other web site
10:26 < webczat:#liferay> hmm i actually meant things like
10:26 < webczat:#liferay> I'm adding a portlet and cannot change it's position w/o the mouse
10:26 <@jhf:#liferay> ahh I see..
10:27 <@jhf:#liferay> which browser and operating system do you use?
10:27 <@jhf:#liferay> there may be a browser and/or OS plugin that lets you mimic the mouse inputs using keyboard only.
10:28 < webczat:#liferay> hmm windows 7/nvda screenreader/ee firefox
10:29 <@jhf:#liferay> I'm not sure if you can read/see this, but here's a good overview of Liferay's accessibility: http://www.slideshare.net/juliocamarero/accessibility-16441704
10:29 <@jhf:#liferay> I will also encourage you to write a forum post at liferay.com/community/forums and I can also put you in contact with one of our accessibility experts (the guy that wrote that slideshare presentation)
10:30 <@jhf:#liferay> Julio would know for sure the best way to do what you ask. in the meantime lemme look around a bit and see if there's a tool you can use.
10:31 <@jhf:#liferay> have you tried Windows 7's "MouseKeys" ? http://www.bbc.co.uk/accessibility/guides/keyboard_mouse/computer/win/win7/index.shtml
10:32 < webczat:#liferay> haha just not sure how could I know what column I'm adding the portlet to, although mouse keys could work, not sure
10:33 <@jhf:#liferay> without having tried it myself, I do not know, but I know Liferay developers go to great lengths to ensure we use the proper metadata when constructing the portal, so for example the CSS used for classifying columns is most likely using an ARIA tag, so it may announce the columns as you "move" a portlet around
10:34 <@jhf:#liferay> Julio would be a really great resource for you to contact. if you send me an email james.falkner@liferay.com and I can put you in contact.
10:35 <@jhf:#liferay> FYI for the 6.2 release we had a few blind users help us test out Liferay's accessibility
10:36 < webczat:#liferay> mhm, actually columns are not announced unless nvda is a stupid piece of crap. I also have other accessibility problems, I have netbook and when the browser is not maximized, I need to expand things in the dock to see anything like sign in. no problem. but i'm unable to expand anything when it comes to for example page administration, like trying to expand this thing that shows the add child...
10:36 < webczat:#liferay> ...page/export/etc buttons. when the browser is maximized there is no problem here.
10:37 <@jhf:#liferay> are you using 6.2?
10:37 < webczat:#liferay> then there is the problem with adding portlets using the add button instead of dragging. :)
10:38 < webczat:#liferay> yes.
10:38 < webczat:#liferay> and have ldap + other issues but I have workarounds for most
10:39 < webczat:#liferay> and I didn't see any need for workarounds for non-administrative content for now.
10:39 < webczat:#liferay> my email is webczat_200@poczta.onet.pl
10:40 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah.. it is possible to build a non-accessible site with Liferay :) but if our administrative UIs are not accessible, that is a problem
10:40 < webczat:#liferay> hmm they are not so bad.
