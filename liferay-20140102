09:41 < hufg-:#liferay> thanks man happy new y√©ar to you too \o/
10:07 < webczat:#liferay> Hello.
10:08 < webczat:#liferay> I'm a blind user and have the following question: is it at all possible for me to lay out webpages without using the mouse?
10:24 <@jhf:#liferay> webczat: yes, it is possible without using the mouse, but it is highly dependent on your browser and its interaction with your operating system (w/r/t keyboard shortcuts)
10:24 < webczat:#liferay> how to do this?
10:25 <@jhf:#liferay> since Liferay's user interface is 99% through the browser, all of its interfaces are standard components (for example, you can press the tab button to cycle through input fields, etC)
10:25 <@jhf:#liferay> you interact with Liferay in the same way you interact with any other web site
10:26 < webczat:#liferay> hmm i actually meant things like
10:26 < webczat:#liferay> I'm adding a portlet and cannot change it's position w/o the mouse
10:26 <@jhf:#liferay> ahh I see..
10:27 <@jhf:#liferay> which browser and operating system do you use?
10:27 <@jhf:#liferay> there may be a browser and/or OS plugin that lets you mimic the mouse inputs using keyboard only.
10:28 < webczat:#liferay> hmm windows 7/nvda screenreader/ee firefox
10:29 <@jhf:#liferay> I'm not sure if you can read/see this, but here's a good overview of Liferay's accessibility: http://www.slideshare.net/juliocamarero/accessibility-16441704
10:29 <@jhf:#liferay> I will also encourage you to write a forum post at liferay.com/community/forums and I can also put you in contact with one of our accessibility experts (the guy that wrote that slideshare presentation)
