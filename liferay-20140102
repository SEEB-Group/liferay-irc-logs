09:23 < hufg-:#liferay> hello hello whats up?
09:34 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey hufg happy new year!
09:41 < hufg-:#liferay> thanks man happy new y√©ar to you too \o/
10:07 < webczat:#liferay> Hello.
10:08 < webczat:#liferay> I'm a blind user and have the following question: is it at all possible for me to lay out webpages without using the mouse?
10:24 <@jhf:#liferay> webczat: yes, it is possible without using the mouse, but it is highly dependent on your browser and its interaction with your operating system (w/r/t keyboard shortcuts)
10:24 < webczat:#liferay> how to do this?
10:25 <@jhf:#liferay> since Liferay's user interface is 99% through the browser, all of its interfaces are standard components (for example, you can press the tab button to cycle through input fields, etC)
10:25 <@jhf:#liferay> you interact with Liferay in the same way you interact with any other web site
10:26 < webczat:#liferay> hmm i actually meant things like
10:26 < webczat:#liferay> I'm adding a portlet and cannot change it's position w/o the mouse
10:26 <@jhf:#liferay> ahh I see..
10:27 <@jhf:#liferay> which browser and operating system do you use?
10:27 <@jhf:#liferay> there may be a browser and/or OS plugin that lets you mimic the mouse inputs using keyboard only.
10:28 < webczat:#liferay> hmm windows 7/nvda screenreader/ee firefox
10:29 <@jhf:#liferay> I'm not sure if you can read/see this, but here's a good overview of Liferay's accessibility: http://www.slideshare.net/juliocamarero/accessibility-16441704
10:29 <@jhf:#liferay> I will also encourage you to write a forum post at liferay.com/community/forums and I can also put you in contact with one of our accessibility experts (the guy that wrote that slideshare presentation)
10:30 <@jhf:#liferay> Julio would know for sure the best way to do what you ask. in the meantime lemme look around a bit and see if there's a tool you can use.
10:31 <@jhf:#liferay> have you tried Windows 7's "MouseKeys" ? http://www.bbc.co.uk/accessibility/guides/keyboard_mouse/computer/win/win7/index.shtml
10:32 < webczat:#liferay> haha just not sure how could I know what column I'm adding the portlet to, although mouse keys could work, not sure
10:33 <@jhf:#liferay> without having tried it myself, I do not know, but I know Liferay developers go to great lengths to ensure we use the proper metadata when constructing the portal, so for example the CSS used for classifying columns is most likely using an ARIA tag, so it may announce the columns as you "move" a portlet around
10:34 <@jhf:#liferay> Julio would be a really great resource for you to contact. if you send me an email james.falkner@liferay.com and I can put you in contact.
10:35 <@jhf:#liferay> FYI for the 6.2 release we had a few blind users help us test out Liferay's accessibility
10:36 < webczat:#liferay> mhm, actually columns are not announced unless nvda is a stupid piece of crap. I also have other accessibility problems, I have netbook and when the browser is not maximized, I need to expand things in the dock to see anything like sign in. no problem. but i'm unable to expand anything when it comes to for example page administration, like trying to expand this thing that shows the add child...
10:36 < webczat:#liferay> ...page/export/etc buttons. when the browser is maximized there is no problem here.
10:37 <@jhf:#liferay> are you using 6.2?
10:37 < webczat:#liferay> then there is the problem with adding portlets using the add button instead of dragging. :)
10:38 < webczat:#liferay> yes.
10:38 < webczat:#liferay> and have ldap + other issues but I have workarounds for most
10:39 < webczat:#liferay> and I didn't see any need for workarounds for non-administrative content for now.
10:39 < webczat:#liferay> my email is webczat_200@poczta.onet.pl
10:40 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah.. it is possible to build a non-accessible site with Liferay :) but if our administrative UIs are not accessible, that is a problem
10:40 < webczat:#liferay> hmm they are not so bad.
10:41 < webczat:#liferay> i only needed to maximize the browser and disable showing account settings in popup. the second one presented a problem when trying to edit a personal site
10:42 < webczat:#liferay> because it behaved like the same showed without popup and with a window normal
10:43 <@jhf:#liferay> well good to know there is a workaround :)
10:43 <@jhf:#liferay> could you file a bug at issues.liferay.com by chance? the more bug reports (esp. accessibility ones) that we get, the better we can make it
10:43 <@jhf:#liferay> in the meantime I will put you in contact with Julio who should know the best way to drag portlets around w/out a mouse
10:44 < webczat:#liferay> unless there is no way. I would say it's understandable for me, but I don't want to search for help :D
10:45 <@jhf:#liferay> no worries, glad I can help (maybE)
10:45 < webczat:#liferay> the page you pointed me to clearly states that liferay is around 70% accessible in administrative pages and 80 in content creation. this may be one of those things
10:48 <@jhf:#liferay> ok webczat email sent
10:50 < webczat:#liferay> ack
10:51 < webczat:#liferay> btw, can you access server administration pages in 6.2? i can't. :D
10:52 <@jhf:#liferay> hmm.. what happens if you go to Control Panel -> Server Administration?
10:52 < webczat:#liferay> like the initial resources page shows up. clicking execute on anything or selecting another tab (inccluding the same resources tab) makes very strange things. the bottom of the page gets invisible, the last thing I see is the configuration menu and logs say something about invalid paths
10:52 <@jhf:#liferay> dang looks like Julio is on holiday till next Monday
10:53 <@jhf:#liferay> hmm.. have not seen that. lemme search bug database (you can also search this at issues.liferay.com)
10:53 < webczat:#liferay> you will find something. I've reported it yesterday haha
10:53 < webczat:#liferay> but wanted to ask if it's not my stupidity
10:53 <@jhf:#liferay> hahaha
10:53 <@jhf:#liferay> which LPS # is it?
10:54 < webczat:#liferay> ahh I don't remember :D
10:54 < webczat:#liferay> lemme check. btw, jira also has accessibility problems. but after some fighting with it I managed to report the bug :D
10:55 <@jhf:#liferay> brb
10:59 < webczat:#liferay> LPS-43190
10:59 < webczat:#liferay> reported a second one by accident too but it is the same
12:25 < webczat:#liferay> :)
12:42 < webczat:#liferay> anyone here?
12:43 < apucay:#liferay> we're all here
12:43 <@jhf:#liferay> post-holiday laziness for me
12:45 < webczat:#liferay> :D I have a question regarding permissions
12:45 < webczat:#liferay> because I like to understand what I'm really doing
12:46 < webczat:#liferay> what would happen if power user didn't have those permissions assignments like media add document etc? isn't it handled on the media portlet permission level?
12:50 < apucay:#liferay> well the defaults perms you can find in resource-actions\documentlibrary.xml
12:50 < apucay:#liferay> portal-impl\src\resource-actions\documentlibrary.xml
12:51 < webczat:#liferay> is iit the same for personal sites?
12:52 < apucay:#liferay> well the only member of a personal site is the person
12:52 < apucay:#liferay> looks like there are defaults for site members
12:53 < webczat:#liferay> hmm if a site member has the permission to do something, it applies to the whole site right? isn't it usually handled like on the object level like the created object assigns permissions to members instead?
12:55 < webczat:#liferay> erm okay, another question: what is the role called owner?
12:56 < apucay:#liferay> i think its for the user who created the entity
12:56 <@jhf:#liferay> webczat: https://www.liferay.com/documentation/liferay-portal/6.2/user-guide/-/ai/roles-and-permissions-liferay-portal-6-2-user-guide-16-en
12:57 <@jhf:#liferay> there is no role called "owner" - there is a "Site owner" role though, and that is by default assigned to the person who created the site (but can be re-assigned as needed, or multiple people can be assigned to the "site owner" role)
12:57 <@jhf:#liferay> note: that particular role is scoped to "site", so when you assign it to someone you have to choose a site AND a person to assign.
12:58 <@jhf:#liferay> ("scoping" of roles and permissions is discussed in that doc link above)
12:58 <@jhf:#liferay> (and is an important thing to understand and also answers your previous question)
13:00 < webczat:#liferay> actually there is a role called owner
13:00 < webczat:#liferay> although not described in the docs, it exists
13:00 < webczat:#liferay> and the description says that it gives permissions to hmm object creators probably
13:09 < webczat:#liferay> I'll research that. the last questions: if guests can not have pages, why they have permissions like add to page for most apps?
13:12 < apucay:#liferay> when you say guest, do you mean unauthenticated user, or an authenticated user who is not a member of a site?
13:14 < webczat:#liferay> the first
13:16 < apucay:#liferay> you experience being able to add porlets to a page, out of the box, as an unauthenticated user?
13:20 < webczat:#liferay> no
13:20 < webczat:#liferay> but I see the permission summary as an admin
13:22 < apucay:#liferay> and Guest is checked for ADD_TO_PAGE?
13:22 < apucay:#liferay> or what is that even available, you're saying?
13:33 < webczat:#liferay> i just see it on the list. i didn't say that guest magically got the permissions :)
13:33 < webczat:#liferay> like i didn't say he can use it
13:34 < webczat:#liferay> also btw from the perspective of a blind computer user, how are portlets lait out by default when I just add them using the add button instead of dragging?
13:41 < webczat:#liferay> like I'm blind and want to know what I'm doing
13:48 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey jhf  -- would you happen to have a link to a really good post on how to configure friendly urls?
13:48 < jardineworks:#liferay> one that shows public render parameters and all
13:49 <@jhf:#liferay> nope, at least, I don't have any "go-to" post that explains fUrls ..
13:49 <@jhf:#liferay> I'd just resort to google for that :(
13:49 <@jhf:#liferay> sorry, mon ami
13:50 < jardineworks:#liferay> ok -- I have a few bookmarked to work with. Thanks all the same. And happy new year :)
13:50 <@jhf:#liferay> yup, same to you (and everyone else)
