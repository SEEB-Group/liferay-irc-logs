10:07 < webczat:#liferay> Hello.
10:08 < webczat:#liferay> I'm a blind user and have the following question: is it at all possible for me to lay out webpages without using the mouse?
10:24 <@jhf:#liferay> webczat: yes, it is possible without using the mouse, but it is highly dependent on your browser and its interaction with your operating system (w/r/t keyboard shortcuts)
10:24 < webczat:#liferay> how to do this?
