02:32 < Jamali:#liferay> what is best solution for a youtube like website which will be liferay base?
03:58 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Jamali: What kind of answer do you expect?
03:58 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> You already picked a solution. Liferay. What else is there? You question is to unspecific for more details.
04:03 < Jamali:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur: Yea Liferay is my primary solution.
04:04 < Jamali:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur: But I still need to implement a youtube like functionality
04:05 < hufg:#liferay> 8)
04:05 < hufg:#liferay> easy work!
04:05 < Jamali:#liferay> :D
04:05 < Jamali:#liferay> yea
04:06 < Jamali:#liferay> but how?
04:06 < Jamali:#liferay> My main question is : what is the best practice to do it?
04:07 < Jamali:#liferay> I need to implement a social network
04:07 < hufg:#liferay> you or your team?
04:07 < Jamali:#liferay> I and my team
04:08 < hufg:#liferay> hehe
04:08 < Jamali:#liferay> :D
04:09 < Jamali:#liferay> there are options on the table such as alfresco
04:09 < Jamali:#liferay> and social networking portlet
04:15 < Jamali:#liferay> what is best practice to implement GIS by liferay ?
04:35 -!- mode/#liferay [+o rotty3000] by ChanServ
04:35 < hufg:#liferay> Jamali: you should take a few weeks to poc
04:36 < hufg:#liferay> impossible to give you a straight answer without having done a gis with liferay
04:36 < hufg:#liferay> who knows
04:36 < hufg:#liferay> maybe it's shit or maybe it's great idk
04:36 < hufg:#liferay> do a few use cases and figure out how to do it with liferay
04:37 < hufg:#liferay> and figure out what you need from your platform
04:38 < hufg:#liferay> you can do pretty much everything with liferay, liferay is not a gis platform so there are no best practices for gis other than experience
04:39 < hufg:#liferay> like do you need staging?
04:39 < hufg:#liferay> the greatness of liferay goes up a notch if you don't
04:40 < hufg:#liferay> what publishing functionality do you need?
04:40 < hufg:#liferay> staging remote, staging local, no publishing(only live site)
05:07 < hufg:#liferay> whatever you do don't pick staging remote
05:07 < hufg:#liferay> the best pracitce is to implement yourself hehe
05:11 < Jamali:#liferay> hufg: thank you, It seems I need to search for open source gis servers and integrate it with liferay
05:22 < hufg:#liferay> Jamali: np np the platform you choose is so important so definitively just poc poc even if it takes time
05:24 < Jamali:#liferay> poc? what do you mean?
05:24 < Jamali:#liferay> proof of concept ?
05:28 < Jamali:#liferay> I'm preparing a proposal for a project which its sub-systems are as follows gis, film and movie (something such as youtube), social network and all applications liferay provides them.
05:29 < Jamali:#liferay> at this time im searching for best architectural design it can have
05:36 < hufg:#liferay> yes
05:37 < hufg:#liferay> ok
05:38 < hufg:#liferay> hehe sounds complex

10:16 < hufg:#liferay> whats uup
10:16 < hufg:#liferay> it's friday bitches!
10:25 < jardineworks:#liferay> woot woot!
10:41 < hufg:#liferay> jardineworks: on what servers are you planning to run liferay?
10:58 < jardineworks:#liferay> hufg, no idea... the ops guys won't tell me haha
10:58 < jardineworks:#liferay> I think they are going to use EC2 though
11:35 < jardineworks:#liferay> hufg, are you still around/
11:36 < hufg:#liferay> yes barely
11:36 < hufg:#liferay> soon weekend
11:36 < jardineworks:#liferay> have you done anything with the asset publisher portlet?
11:38 < hufg:#liferay> no
11:39 < hufg:#liferay> we had plans for it but ditched it and made similiar stuff ourself
11:39 < hufg:#liferay> just tag based retrieval of articles
11:40 < jardineworks:#liferay> hufg, ok ... do you know whether or not it is possible to retrieve content based on one of the structure attribute values?
11:40 < jardineworks:#liferay> i don't really see how to be honest
11:40 < jardineworks:#liferay> so I am guessing not
11:41 < hufg:#liferay> i think it's not possible
11:41 < hufg:#liferay> you can make some ugly hacks though
11:41 < hufg:#liferay> 8)
11:41 < jardineworks:#liferay> hahah
11:41 < jardineworks:#liferay> no thanks!
11:41 < jardineworks:#liferay> I already did what you did :)
11:41 < jardineworks:#liferay> just wondering if I could have used this instead
11:42 < hufg:#liferay> hehe
11:57 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> jardineworks: To keep you updated on the CDN issue: We are going with a custom build process that will preprocess the SCSS files and build a deployment package for S3.
11:58 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Our offshore developer estimated 1-2 days implementation time. We will know next week, if this is a feasible solution.
11:58 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, when does the prepocess process run?
12:00 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> During build time.
12:00 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> It will take the portal-web.war from the Liferay source, extract the assets, preprocess them and push them to the S3 bucket.
12:03 < jardineworks:#liferay> cool! :)
12:03 < jardineworks:#liferay> we're doing something similar to get around the RasterImage exception
12:03 < jardineworks:#liferay> so we can use JDK 7 with the 6.1.2 GA3
12:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> even though we don't really need it. Security weirdos... they don't even get that the fixes in that JDK are for applets and web start applications -- completely N/A for us.
12:07 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Oh well. That's enough for me. I'm calling it a day.
12:07 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Have a nice weekend. :)
12:14 < jardineworks:#liferay> you too
12:14 < jardineworks:#liferay> talk to you next week
