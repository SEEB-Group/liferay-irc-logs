06:22 < hufg:#liferay> helloo helloo
06:22 < hufg:#liferay> whats up
06:22 < hufg:#liferay> it's my last day on liferay :x
06:31 < topolik1:#liferay> hi hufg, was good to work with you!
06:32 < hufg:#liferay> hehe thanks thanks
06:33 < hufg:#liferay> no computer stuff for me for a year so i may write some blog posts and perhaps beat lps40416 with some megahack
07:50 < jardineworks:#liferay> hufg, no computer for a year? where you headed?
07:52 < hufg:#liferay> jardineworks: i'm doing civil service instead of army which will be hehe "janitor" at a school for teenagers aged 15-18
07:52 < jardineworks:#liferay> I guess that means that Finland still has conscription?
07:52 < hufg:#liferay> not too keen on fighting in wars caused by other peoples stupidity+greed
07:52 < hufg:#liferay> yes
07:54 < hufg:#liferay> it will be grreat, back to boxing, back to snowboarding and i have already paid for art lessons
07:55 < hufg:#liferay> 8)
07:55 < jardineworks:#liferay> that sounds awesome... and I couldnt agree more about the war non sense.
07:55 < jardineworks:#liferay> did your site go live yet?
07:55 < hufg:#liferay> no but it will ;)
07:55 < hufg:#liferay> i'll post a link once it comes
07:57 < jardineworks:#liferay> sounds good.
08:00 < hufg:#liferay> feeling good about it
08:00 < jardineworks:#liferay> so how does it work? does your company keep your position while you are away?
08:00 < hufg:#liferay> yes
08:00 < jardineworks:#liferay> or do you have to look for a new job in a year?
08:00 < hufg:#liferay> it's the law 8)
08:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> figured... makes sense
08:01 < hufg:#liferay> it's like a long unpaid vacation
08:02 < hufg:#liferay> during that time the you get your rent paid and some food in your mouth
08:02 < hufg:#liferay> and thats about it
08:03 < hufg:#liferay> and i guess no need for loan payments etc. and they will pay the interest
08:03 < jardineworks:#liferay> too bad you couldn't also go somewhere hot :)
08:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey topolik1 do you have a minute for a friendly url question?
08:05 < hufg:#liferay> hehe yeah
08:08 < hufg:#liferay> my first blog post would be "you suck, liferay doesn't"
08:08 < hufg:#liferay> a provocative tone to lessen the mythical aura of bullshit surrounding liferay
08:08 < hufg:#liferay> 8)
08:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> hahaha great title
08:09 < topolik1:#liferay> jardineworks: hi, try it :)
08:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik1, it's not working
08:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> :)
08:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> all the time...
08:10 < topolik1:#liferay> try harder :)
08:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> LOL
08:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> last night I did one, and it wasn't working... and then all of sudden magically it was working
08:10 < topolik1:#liferay> haha :D
08:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> this morning I am trying another which is also not working
08:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> and the magic still seems to be sleeping
08:11 < topolik1:#liferay> ok, let's wake it up :)
08:11 < topolik1:#liferay> I know children knows good wake-up spells
08:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> I think i understand how the mapper works (based on what I got working last night) .. but maybe if I could walk you through what I have...
08:12 < topolik1:#liferay> ok
08:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> my son could be a witch.
08:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> ok -- so first, my url http://localhost:8080/web/guest/recipes?p_auth=jU4TIJGH&p_p_id=recipesearch_WAR_recipeportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&p_p_col_id=column-1&p_p_col_count=1&_recipesearch_WAR_recipeportlet_javax.portlet.action=searchRecipes
08:13 < jardineworks:#liferay> (let me pastie a couple of things)
08:13 < topolik1:#liferay> ok
08:14 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik1, liferay-portlet.xml --> http://pastebin.com/AyNArx3v
08:15 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik1, recipe-search-friendly-url-routes.xml --> http://pastebin.com/EmuJUJHw
08:16 < jardineworks:#liferay> (fixing the pattern to be /)
08:17 < jardineworks:#liferay> and now it is working :S
08:18 < topolik1:#liferay> :D
08:19 < topolik1:#liferay> good job!
08:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> lol
08:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> my son just woke uo
08:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> up*
08:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> hahaha
08:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik1, can you have a route definition with no pattern? meaning <pattern/>?
08:21 < topolik1:#liferay> I don't know :)
08:21 < topolik1:#liferay> probably yes
08:22 < jardineworks:#liferay> what?! all my reading last night YOU were the guy answering all the friendly url questions :)
08:22 < topolik1:#liferay> haha :D
08:22 < topolik1:#liferay> you know how it is with my memory
08:22 < topolik1:#liferay> I frequently need to make space for new things :)
08:23 < jardineworks:#liferay> you should consider an upgrade. RAM is cheap these days.
08:26 < topolik1:#liferay> well, it seems that I  use only L2 caches :D
08:26 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik1, do you know if it is possible to put render parameters in the resulting friendly url?
08:26 < jardineworks:#liferay> haha
08:27 < topolik1:#liferay> what do you mean by the resulting friendly url?
08:27 < topolik1:#liferay> all parameters you append to the friendly URL should be OK
08:27 < topolik1:#liferay> and (on the other hand)
08:28 < topolik1:#liferay> you should be able to configure static parameters for any friendly URL in the XML
08:30 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik1,  in my code I forward the user at the end of the action to the render phase. before doing so I setParameter ... so sorry, not renderParameters, but basically parameters that are not appearing in the loooooooooong url. Specifically, I want to put the query into the url ... so if someone searches for meat sauce then I want it to show /recipe/-/search/meat-sauce ... right now it only shows /recipe/-/search
08:31 < jardineworks:#liferay> and when I remove the friendly url and look at the full url query string, my q parameter is not there
08:34 < topolik1:#liferay> jardineworks: uhm
08:34 < jardineworks:#liferay> am I asking a dumb question? :)
08:35 < topolik1:#liferay> no
08:35 < topolik1:#liferay> so in the action phase you set render parameter but the render parameter is not present in the render url, which is the nice friendly url ?
08:38 < jardineworks:#liferay> well, I am not setting it as a render parameter anymore... I was, but now I am creating a liferay portlet url and setting the parameter on it. Then at the end of the action, I am redirecting to that url.
08:38 < topolik1:#liferay> ok
08:38 < topolik1:#liferay> and that URL does not have the parameter?
08:39 < jardineworks:#liferay> well, I have not mapped it in my routes file so if it was there it should be showing (I think) .. but it is not.
08:50 < topolik1:#liferay> hmm, I need to try
08:50 < topolik1:#liferay> from code it seems it should work
08:50 < topolik1:#liferay> jardineworks: 6.1.2?
08:50 < jardineworks:#liferay> yep
08:54 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik1, and it broke my search!
08:54 < jardineworks:#liferay> :(
08:55 < jardineworks:#liferay> which would explain the parameters missing probably
09:04 < hufg:#liferay> anyone ever realized how absolutely amazing glassfish command line tooling is?
09:05 < hufg:#liferay> i could start selling liferay domain installation scripts like it's nothing!
09:06 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik1, This is like mad science. How would you create a map for this url? http://localhost:8080/web/guest/recipes?p_auth=jU4TIJGH&p_p_id=recipesearch_WAR_recipeportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&p_p_col_id=column-1&p_p_col_count=1&_recipesearch_WAR_recipeportlet_javax.portlet.action=searchRecipes
09:07 < jardineworks:#liferay> I set all the paramters to ignored, except the last one which I set to implicit.
09:07 < jardineworks:#liferay> but it doesn't work.
09:16 < topolik1:#liferay> jardineworks: I don't remember, honestly :/
09:16 < jardineworks:#liferay> :9
09:16 < topolik1:#liferay> but the important params are p_p_lifecycle and javax.portlet.action
09:17 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik1, ok -- so the issue is that I need the javax.portlet.action to be visible ... so how do I include it, but hide it?
09:17 < topolik1:#liferay> you should match these 2
09:17 < jardineworks:#liferay> implicit?
09:18 < topolik1:#liferay> looking at portal examples almost always the parameters are implicit
09:18 < topolik1:#liferay> thinking of it (trying to remember) - there are 2 processes
09:18 < topolik1:#liferay> 1. from params to friendly url
09:19 < topolik1:#liferay> 2. from friendly url to params
09:19 < topolik1:#liferay> implicit parameters seem to be hidden in URL but used in parameters
09:19 < jardineworks:#liferay> i see
09:19 < topolik1:#liferay> by "params" I mean parameters map
09:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> and the map only applies if ALL the parameters in the route definition are matched right?
09:20 < topolik1:#liferay> ok, looking at the DRD
09:20 < topolik1:#liferay> DTD
09:21 < topolik1:#liferay> ignored-parameter - Ignored parameters do not effect URL recognition.
09:21 < topolik1:#liferay> implicit-parameter -  is not present in the route pattern.
09:21 < topolik1:#liferay> overridden-parameter - a parameter that should be set to a certain value when a URL is recognized
09:22 < topolik1:#liferay> generated-parameter - a parameter that will be generated from other parameters when a URL is recognized
09:23 < topolik1:#liferay> so only implicit-parameter should be used to recognize the url to be built into friendly url
09:24 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik1, if I ignore all those parameters but set the javax.portlet.action as <implicit-parameter name="javax.portlet.action">searchRecipes</implicit-parameter> it should match... and the search recipes should still be passed in the parameter map
09:25 -!- mode/#liferay [+o jhf] by ChanServ
09:26 < topolik1:#liferay> jardineworks: I'm not sure that you need to ignore all the other params
09:27 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik1, but when you set somethin to implicit, then you need to specify the value right?
09:27 < topolik1:#liferay> or you don't need to specify it at all
09:27 < jardineworks:#liferay> so I would have to do <implicit-parameter name="p_p_mode">view</implicit-parameter> for example right?
09:27 < jardineworks:#liferay> oh
09:27 < jardineworks:#liferay> but if you don't specify it at all, it will be left in the url no?
09:28 < topolik1:#liferay> there are some ignored by default
09:28 < jardineworks:#liferay> oh
09:28 < jardineworks:#liferay> I didn;t know that
09:29 < topolik1:#liferay> https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/blob/6.1.1-ga2/portal-service/src/com/liferay/portal/kernel/portlet/DefaultFriendlyURLMapper.java#L55,L67
09:30 < topolik1:#liferay> I think they should be ignored or have a default value
09:30 < jardineworks:#liferay> so see.. if I just put the javax.portlet.action and the p_p_lifecycle as implicit parameters ... then my search fails
09:30 < jardineworks:#liferay> meaning the search action is never fired...
09:31 < jardineworks:#liferay> my portlet:actionURL seems to become a renderURL
09:34 < jardineworks:#liferay>  defaultReservedParameters.put("p_p_lifecycle", "0");
09:34 < jardineworks:#liferay> perhaps that should be overriden for me to 1
09:37 < topolik1:#liferay> yeah
09:38 < topolik1:#liferay> but that should be done with the lifecycle implicit param
09:41 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik1, ok .. so if I have nothing bu <route><pattern>/</pattern></route> ... then I see the p_p_id, p_p_col_id, etc removed and my form url is set to
09:41 < jardineworks:#liferay> http://localhost:8080/web/guest/recipes/-/search/?p_auth=jU4TIJGH&p_p_lifecycle=1&_recipesearch_WAR_recipeportlet_javax.portlet.action=searchRecipes
09:41 < jardineworks:#liferay> but, when I click it...
09:41 < jardineworks:#liferay> it doesn't go to the action phase.
09:42 < jardineworks:#liferay> it executes my render url
09:43 < jardineworks:#liferay> sorry -- render method
09:50 < topolik1:#liferay> hmm
09:50 < topolik1:#liferay> do you need the portlet id prefix for friendly urls?
09:53 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik1, not sure -- Liferay is just adding it for me
09:55 < topolik1:#liferay> hm, so liferay generates this url, but when you hit it it won't trigger the action phase?
09:55 < jardineworks:#liferay> right
09:59 < topolik1:#liferay> strange
10:00 < jardineworks:#liferay> ok -- from the top.
10:00 < jardineworks:#liferay> no friendly url configuration in the liferay-portlet.xml
10:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> in the page source for the action I see -- <form name="fm" method="post" action="http://localhost:8080/web/guest/recipes?p_auth=jU4TIJGH&amp;p_p_id=recipesearch_WAR_recipeportlet&amp;p_p_lifecycle=1&amp;p_p_state=normal&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-1&amp;p_p_col_count=1&amp;_recipesearch_WAR_recipeportlet_javax.portlet.action=searchRecipes"> <div class="chalkboard-large-content-container"> <div class="chalkboard-filter-container"> <div class=

10:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> woah
10:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> sorry
10:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> http://localhost:8080/web/guest/recipes?p_auth=jU4TIJGH&p_p_id=recipesearch_WAR_recipeportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&p_p_col_id=column-1&p_p_col_count=1&_recipesearch_WAR_recipeportlet_javax.portlet.action=searchRecipes
10:01 < hufg:#liferay> cheers! bye!
10:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> and when I do the search, it works
10:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> bye hufg  -- best o fluck
10:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> haha
10:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> of luck.
10:02 < jardineworks:#liferay> add in the friendly url mapping to liferay-portlet.xml --> http://pastebin.com/AyNArx3v
10:03 < jardineworks:#liferay> add in the route mapping --> http://pastebin.com/dLBNNQpH
10:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> url in the page source is now -- http://localhost:8080/web/guest/recipes/-/recipe/search?p_auth=jU4TIJGH&p_p_lifecycle=1&_recipesearch_WAR_recipeportlet_javax.portlet.action=searchRecipes
10:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> which makes sense... all the default stuff is being hidden
10:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> lifecycle and action are present so it should still work.
10:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> try to search ...
10:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> it worked :|
10:06 < jardineworks:#liferay> ok...
10:06 < jardineworks:#liferay> BUT!
10:06 < jardineworks:#liferay> I want to hide the action and the lifecycle.
10:07 < jardineworks:#liferay> update the route file to --> http://pastebin.com/H16cXQtM
10:08 < jardineworks:#liferay> and the url in the page source is --> http://localhost:8080/web/guest/recipes/-/recipe/search?p_auth=jU4TIJGH
10:08 < jardineworks:#liferay> which is right since now I am hiding the action and the lifecycle.
10:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> and the search works
10:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> :S
10:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> apparently I just needed to type out everything I was doing.
10:16 < jardineworks:#liferay> ... and it doesn't work. wtf.
10:17 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, do you have any experience with friendly urls?
10:23 <@jhf:#liferay> jardineworks: nope :(
10:30 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf -- no worries. I think I finally get it.
10:30 < jardineworks:#liferay> One more for the blog post list.
10:31 <@jhf:#liferay> (makes note of jardineworks as friendlyUrl expert)
10:31 < jardineworks:#liferay> yikes!
10:31 < jardineworks:#liferay> don't do that! lol
10:31 <@jhf:#liferay> (annotation: difficult to get along with)
10:31 <@jhf:#liferay> ;-)
10:37 < jardineworks:#liferay> haha
10:37 < jardineworks:#liferay> "not friendly"
10:37 < jardineworks:#liferay> funny -- like most things in your product, a horror to learn but once you understand how it works .. excellent design :)
10:38 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah... this year I'm going to start a bi-monthly 1-hour developer hangout, hoping to de-mystify many development tasks.. interested in holding a session? :)
10:39 < jardineworks:#liferay> for sure
10:39 <@jhf:#liferay> \o/ i'll follow up via email. probably some time in feb.
10:39 < jardineworks:#liferay> there is so much more content out there now than there was just a couple of years ago but its always the same
10:39 <@jhf:#liferay> (the session, not the follow-up) but its up to your (busy) schedule
10:40 < jardineworks:#liferay> "here is this neat thing... " ... and here is the simplest example of how to use it.
10:40 < jardineworks:#liferay> this project is supposed to roll out this month at which point I am hoping to hide from my clients for a few weeks ... maybe even the month of feb.
10:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, I'm still trying to find that rotty guy to ask him a question about search
10:52 <@jhf:#liferay> I'm assuming ray is still on holiday break... probably will be back next week though I dunno for sure!
10:53 < jardineworks:#liferay> breaks?! lazy canadians.
11:16 < webczat:#liferay> hey, anyone here?
11:19 < webczat:#liferay> I have another, problem without a workaround, I cannot add structures, like I don't find any function to do it
11:21 <@jhf:#liferay> webczat: 6.2? I believe in 6.2, the underlying mechanism supporting web content structures moved to the DDM infrastructure/libraries.
11:21 < webczat:#liferay> actually I see the site administration thing, manage structures and it displays a list of structures (empty at first) ant what else? nothing. I can search for structures, but cannot add them
11:22 <@jhf:#liferay> is there no 'add' button when you click on 'manage structures' ?
11:22 < webczat:#liferay> no
11:22 <@jhf:#liferay> hmmmmm... one sec, firing up 6.2. I'm pretty sure it's there, I've used it before.
11:22 <@jhf:#liferay> you logged in with sufficient privileges?
11:23 < webczat:#liferay> yes. it may be a pure accessibility issue
11:23 < webczat:#liferay> so if you see it and I don't...
11:25 <@jhf:#liferay> from the front page, I click on Admin->Content
11:25 <@jhf:#liferay> then click "Web Content"
11:25 <@jhf:#liferay> then "Manage" drop-down, pick "Structures"
11:25 <@jhf:#liferay> there is a bar at the top on the left of the bar is an "Add" link
11:25 < webczat:#liferay> ahm so I probably don't see the bar
11:25 <@jhf:#liferay> (on the right of the bar is a search box)
11:26 <@jhf:#liferay> manage->structures is in a popup
11:26 < webczat:#liferay> I see something that when I click on pulls the search box. no bar
11:26 <@jhf:#liferay> so yeah this sounds like an accessibility issue..
11:26 < webczat:#liferay> I know. and that may be a problem
11:26 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah there is a link on the left of that bar, entitled "Add" (with a plus button next to the word Add)
11:26 <@jhf:#liferay> it's a "real" link (not a javascript weird thing)
11:26 <@jhf:#liferay> so would be surprised if your screen reader does not "see" it
11:27 <@jhf:#liferay> when I hit 'tab' key, it's the first thing that gets highlighted
11:27 <@jhf:#liferay> however, if I try to use the spacebar to 'click' on the link, it doesn't worjk.
11:27 < webczat:#liferay> ha and i don't see the link. popups are problematic at least on my small netbook screen
11:28 < webczat:#liferay> because some things are collapsed and there is no way to exxpand. I would say this bug is critical for me because I wanted to make a structure for describing software projects
11:28 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah..
11:28 <@jhf:#liferay> what's the resolution of your screen?
11:28 < webczat:#liferay> who knows? erm
11:29 <@jhf:#liferay> when I squeeze down my browser window (to emulate a mobile device) the 'add' button disappears
11:29 < webczat:#liferay> and how do you expand it?
11:29 <@jhf:#liferay> I have to click the little button with 3 horizontal stripes to see the 'add' function
11:29 <@jhf:#liferay> do you 'see' a button next to the search button?
11:29 < webczat:#liferay> ahha so... is it a tcheme changing?
11:29 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah.. my guess is your netbook screen is small enough to trigger the responsive layout changes
11:29 < webczat:#liferay> hmmmmm wait a while
11:29 <@jhf:#liferay> and so stuff gets moved around and collapsed into mobile-friendly big buttons
11:30 < webczat:#liferay> I would happily enforce classic theme on everything
11:30 < webczat:#liferay> probably possible?
11:30 < webczat:#liferay> I see a button next to the search box, but I don't currently have this thingy opened
11:31 < webczat:#liferay> opening
11:34 < webczat:#liferay> page opened and I'm in manage\structures. what I see is something that is reported a clickable without label. pressing enter on it expands a search box
11:34 <@jhf:#liferay> is it possible for you to take a screenshot and upload it to imgur.com ?
11:34 < webczat:#liferay> and I see a search box.
11:35 < webczat:#liferay> hmm
11:35 <@jhf:#liferay> the other thing you could try is to screen-share with me (using http://join.me)
11:35 <@jhf:#liferay> so I can see what's going on
11:35 < webczat:#liferay> hmm is this button near search for advanced search?
11:35 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah that's an advanced search butto
11:36 <@jhf:#liferay> the 'add structure' button should come before it (in the link order of the popup
11:36 < webczat:#liferay> but there is no add link. the same happens if you trigger a mobile theme and then try to go to site pages. and then you are happy because you can't see the add page thing
11:37 <@jhf:#liferay> which netbook do you have?
11:37 < webczat:#liferay> acer AOA150
11:38 < webczat:#liferay> I'm going to try hard to enforce classic theme on mobile devices. or at least on my account
11:38 < webczat:#liferay> not sure if possible
11:38 <@jhf:#liferay> ok yeah when I run in that resolution, the theme changes to mobile-like
11:39 <@jhf:#liferay> and the 'add' link is gone (it's under the button with three horizontal stripes)
11:39 < webczat:#liferay> mhm
11:39 <@jhf:#liferay> so this sounds like an accessibility issue.
11:40 < webczat:#liferay> it seems then like a classic theme can be thought as "accessible mostly" and it's better not to use the mobile theme if you can. good to know. because now I can try to find more permanent workarounds.
11:42 < webczat:#liferay> I'm trying to find a platform to build my site, not just testing. and this one seems wonderful in the terms of available functions. but I wouldn't choose something that I cannot use
11:43 < webczat:#liferay> ok, still trying
11:44 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah, understood.. the 'classic' theme is one that, as of 6.2, has 'responsive design' - so it's designed to work across a range of screen sizes. It's not a "mobile theme" in that it doesn't detect your device type (like android vs. iOS vs. something else)
11:44 <@jhf:#liferay> it just changes its layout and uses modern html/js/css techniques to fit itself to whatever screen size you happen to be using (which is why I can easily emulate a 1024x600 netbook screen, even on my high resolution desktop, and see what happens)
11:45 <@jhf:#liferay> it is possible though to do traditional 'mobile device detection' and, for example, redirect foo.com to m.foo.com (which has a different, mobile-dedicated theme)
11:45 <@jhf:#liferay> that's different than using a universal 'responsive' theme though (like what we currently have by default, wit the "classic" theme)
11:45 < webczat:#liferay> I thought the mobile theme is a separate one.
11:46 < webczat:#liferay> okay. so what to do now...
11:46 <@jhf:#liferay> you can assign a mobile theme to be used when a particular device (or set of device families) is detected.
11:46 < webczat:#liferay> actually I'd be happy to disable responsiveness
11:46 <@jhf:#liferay> but the 'classic' theme as shipped with liferay doesn't do that - instead it uses special CSS classes to 'respond' to the size of the screen on which it is rendered.
11:46 <@jhf:#liferay> you could perhaps download and use a non-responsive theme from liferay.com/marketplace
11:47 < webczat:#liferay> of course. but this is a problem because it should also be accessible
11:47 < webczat:#liferay> and i can never guarantee this before testing
11:47 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah, it sounds like there is an accessibility bug in the classic theme.
11:47 <@jhf:#liferay> I would suggest filing a bug (if you haven't already)
11:48 < webczat:#liferay> any chances to fix those in 6.2? this one was reported by me today and I'm using 6.2.x git branch, not a GA release, so I will be able to use any fixes you give
11:48 <@jhf:#liferay> if they get fixed, they will most likely be fixed in trunk, but would probably be trivial to back port to 6.2.x
11:49 < webczat:#liferay> mhm not going to use trunk because I don't want unknown undocumented features in unknown places with unknown bugs from the development version
11:49 <@jhf:#liferay> the only time Liferay back ports to an earlier release (like 6.2) is either a) because a customer needs a patch, or b) we are going to do another 6.2 CE release (e.g. 6.2.1)
11:50 <@jhf:#liferay> so then you would need to back port it to 6.2.x once it's fixed on trunk (it would probably be trivial, like a one-liner somewhere)
11:50 <@jhf:#liferay> or wait for the next CE release :)
11:50 < webczat:#liferay> or I should download another theme
11:50 < webczat:#liferay> as I sait, it is few commits ahead of the GA1 thing
11:51 < webczat:#liferay> what theme would you recommend (in general)? or do you usually use a classic one?
11:52 <@jhf:#liferay> I usually use classic.. most 'real' public-facing websites that have professional dev/support usually contract to build their own. but there are several on liferay.com/marketplace that you could try out.
11:52 < webczat:#liferay> I don't mind all those menus, menu bars, javascript fancy things if I at least have a workaround to be able to use them
11:52 <@jhf:#liferay> there are a couple of commercial providers of themes as well
11:52 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah.. i'd be real curious to see why it doesn't work.
11:52 <@jhf:#liferay> so screenshot, screenshare, or something would be really helpful
11:53 < webczat:#liferay> just not sure how to take them. never done that on windows. linux is better, shows a save as dialog when someone presses printscreen
11:53 <@jhf:#liferay> so why are you using windows on a netbook then :)
11:54 < webczat:#liferay> because linux had more accessibility problems than it fixed.
11:55 < webczat:#liferay> like not from the beginning, just later. new releases were breaking stuff because so much changes were going. I think it stabilizes but I'm still on windows
11:56 <@jhf:#liferay> gotcha. do you have a larger desktop (or just a larger screen) somewhere, so that the 'responsiveness' of the classic theme reveals the 'add' link? i'm wondering if just a larger screen makes it all work for you.
11:57 < webczat:#liferay> hmm of course I do. but this computer has no operating system hahahaha
11:57 < webczat:#liferay> hmm this computer currently has two disks in raid0 and no os
11:58 <@jhf:#liferay> pfft.. operating systems are for n00bs
11:58 < webczat:#liferay> and I do have a screenshot in clipboard. tested in word because I can see when I have a graphic in the document while I can't in paint for example
11:58 <@jhf:#liferay> just code a browser in assembly.
11:58 <@jhf:#liferay> and upload it directly to memory by soldering some pins
11:58 < webczat:#liferay> could you please write me a specification of my NIC and soundcard? :D
11:59 <@jhf:#liferay> sure! I have a copy right here. that'll be $25,000 to license it to you.
12:00 < webczat:#liferay> yeah. I will take it. but I'll pay after... hmm I'll get those money.
12:00 < webczat:#liferay> so like after my death would be sufficient
12:01 <@jhf:#liferay> i'll give you a hint: pin 5 is GND
12:01 <@jhf:#liferay> the rest you have to reverse engineer
12:01 < webczat:#liferay> of course
12:02 < webczat:#liferay> I should now thank you by disabling a20 on your running ddevice. I just don't see from this distance if it's x86 or not haha
12:02 < webczat:#liferay> where to upload this image? forgot the url
12:03 <@jhf:#liferay> imgur.com
12:03 <@jhf:#liferay> no idea if that site is accessible though :)
12:04 < webczat:#liferay> ha ha. maybe it's not? :D I loooove them.
12:04 < webczat:#liferay> actually I'm not sure
12:06 < webczat:#liferay> hey, I'm getting angry.
12:06 < webczat:#liferay> next please :D
12:06 < webczat:#liferay> people don't like us haha
12:06 < webczat:#liferay> any other site?
12:07 <@jhf:#liferay> hmm
12:07 <@jhf:#liferay> http://postimage.org/
12:08 < webczat:#liferay> how nice. translation in polish. btw, polish translation of liferay needs a real fix :D
12:09 < webczat:#liferay> and this site will work
12:09 <@jhf:#liferay> well, I have just the team for you think
12:09 <@jhf:#liferay> http://www.liferay.com/community/wiki/-/wiki/Main/Liferay+Translation+Team
12:10 <@jhf:#liferay> https://www.liferay.com/community/wiki/-/wiki/Main/Translation+Team#section-Translation+Team-Polish+(pl)
12:10 <@jhf:#liferay> if you want to help with translations, I recommend posting to https://www.liferay.com/web/guest/community/forums/-/message_boards/category/1925364
12:10 <@jhf:#liferay> btw we have a polish subcategory on the forums: https://www.liferay.com/community/forums/-/message_boards/category/21045100
12:11 <@jhf:#liferay> and several active members and employees in Poland!
12:12 < webczat:#liferay> haha it all depends.
12:12 < webczat:#liferay> It would be hard for me to do something if I would be forced to uninstall liferay or something. if I'll be able to use it then I will probably try to fix the translation manually. and if I'll ever do, I'll share it.
12:15 < webczat:#liferay> do you see something?
12:15 < webczat:#liferay> http://s27.postimg.org/muiwo3per/screenshot.png
12:16 <@jhf:#liferay> yep. it appears you have triggered a search
12:16 <@jhf:#liferay> when I click on the search button (at your screen res, this appears to be as a magnifying glass icon), I see what you have in that screenshot
12:16 <@jhf:#liferay> a search entry box that takes up the whole width of the popup
12:16 <@jhf:#liferay> however, I only get that if I actually click on the magnifying glass button
12:17 <@jhf:#liferay> before that, I see the 'three horizontal stripe' button next to the magnifying glass icon
12:17 <@jhf:#liferay> if I trigger a search, then click 'outside' the search box, the long search entry box disappears and the original two buttons (magnifying glass and three-horizontal-stripe) come back
12:17 < webczat:#liferay> I am able to get to the search box
12:20 < webczat:#liferay> and where do you see the add button then?
12:20 <@jhf:#liferay> when I first click on Manage->Structures
12:20 <@jhf:#liferay> I see a box at the top, with two icons on the right
12:20 <@jhf:#liferay> a magnifying glass (search) and a three-horizontal-stripe button
12:21 <@jhf:#liferay> when I click the three-horizontal-stripe button, it reveals a small menu, on which there is only one option: "Add"
12:21 <@jhf:#liferay> only when I click on the magnifying glass button do I see the search entry box that you show in your screenshot
12:24 < webczat:#liferay> so why I see the one but not the other? two unlabelled clickable icons >>>  one unlabelled and one invisible
12:24 <@jhf:#liferay> that sounds like an accessibility problem - somewhere we are missing an important (likely related to ARIA) tag somewhere in the responsive classic theme
12:25 < webczat:#liferay> and...
12:25 < webczat:#liferay> I'm not sure what theme can I use.
12:26 < webczat:#liferay> and I'm not sure why liferay was able to deploy marketplace, but says that hot deploy is disabled
12:26 < webczat:#liferay> like unsupported, not disabled
12:26 <@jhf:#liferay> which app server are you using?
12:26 <@jhf:#liferay> or servlet container (e.g. Tomcat?)
12:26 < webczat:#liferay> hmm wildfly. it's ... you would say jboss8 if you don't know what wildfly is
12:27 < webczat:#liferay> compatible enough to run liferay properly with one exception: some bug in one or the other forced me to comment the gzip filter in web.xml :) but apart from that all instructions from jboss7 work
12:27 <@jhf:#liferay> ah yeah, that's a known issue - I don't think jboss8 (wildfly) is supported yet.
12:28 <@jhf:#liferay> the thing that detects whether hot deploy is enabled or not doesn't know about jboss8 .. yet.
12:28 <@jhf:#liferay> and it's long story as to why marketplace-portlet was able to be deployed :)
12:28 < webczat:#liferay> I would understand that it's not supported. but can't I tell the app that hot deploy is supported no matter what it thinks?
12:29 < webczat:#liferay> like "i.know.better"
12:30 < webczat:#liferay> ehm what a cool name for the portal.properties property. :D with a comment like "set to true if you want to use very advanced settings that override the autodetection logic"
12:30 <@jhf:#liferay> haha is there an override?? i did not know that.
12:30 <@jhf:#liferay> here's the code that attempts to detect hot deploy-ness: https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/blob/5a8640237521b2b8d68dd4a4fdfc478aa7426cf5/portal-impl/src/com/liferay/portal/server/capabilities/JBossServerCapabilities.java
12:31 < webczat:#liferay> mhm
12:33 < webczat:#liferay> what a hack...
12:33 < webczat:#liferay> anyway
12:33 < webczat:#liferay> I have the deployment scanner enabled, working etc. and as I sait marketplace has been deployed
12:34 < webczat:#liferay> also the deployment scanner in liferay is active
12:36 < webczat:#liferay> I actually have an additional test portal instance in my liferay installation with default passwords :D
12:37 <@jhf:#liferay> unfortunately, you happen to be on the bleeding edge of Liferay: brand new (unsupported) app server, polish language, relying on accessibility, and a netbook to boot. it's really great to see this!
12:37 <@jhf:#liferay> (to see that you've gotten that far).. we're not perfect, but this is a really useful test case. so I really appreciate you trying everything out :)
12:38 < webczat:#liferay> actually, it is the same server, just slightly newer so I'm surprised
12:38 < webczat:#liferay> and changed, j2ee7
12:39 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah....... java ee 7 was just finalized back in june.
12:39 < webczat:#liferay> and so everything except the gzip filter (probably wildfly bug that I've reported) and except hot deploy works normally
12:39 <@jhf:#liferay> and don't call it j2ee - you'll get in big trouble with the head java ee boss people
12:40 < webczat:#liferay> I know javaee7 was just finalized. and I just had to use it. I'm not a javaee7 developer (or actually not a javaee developer) but I'm going to learn it in the future.
12:41 < webczat:#liferay> and I have some basic knowledge about the theory
12:43 < webczat:#liferay> could you check how this portlet adding by add button works?
12:44 < webczat:#liferay> like how it lays out content
12:45 <@jhf:#liferay> for me, in 6.2, when I click the 'add' button, it's always added at the top of column 1
12:45 <@jhf:#liferay> (based on the layout template). most layout templates have 2 or 3 columns total, so apps always get added to the top of the first (left-most) column
12:46 < webczat:#liferay> okay so it's what I thought. I add bottom-up. it's uncomfortable :D
12:46 <@jhf:#liferay> that's weird.. hmm.. maybe it behaves differently in a small screen. testing..
12:46 < webczat:#liferay> top of the first column
12:47 < webczat:#liferay> I understood it as like it adds it always on the top
12:47 < webczat:#liferay> and this would mean that the second added portlet is above the first
12:47 <@jhf:#liferay> nope it also adds to the top of column 1 for me, even on small screens
12:47 <@jhf:#liferay> right, that's how it should work.
12:47 <@jhf:#liferay> does it not work like that for you?
12:47 < webczat:#liferay> hmm wait
12:47 < webczat:#liferay> the first portlet is added at the top of column1
12:48 < webczat:#liferay> the secon dportlet is where? below the first? or above the first?
12:48 <@jhf:#liferay> it should be above the first
12:48 < webczat:#liferay> so it's bottom-up adding. :D
12:49 < webczat:#liferay> the first is at the top, but then it goes down. and this is uncomfortable because I would rather first add naigation, then something etc
12:50 < webczat:#liferay> Is adding top to bottom a very bad idea visually?
12:51 < webczat:#liferay> how bad I cannot do like in gtk horizontal layouts
12:53 <@jhf:#liferay> well I am not a user experience expert, but I don't have a strong preference either way. you have more experience than me!
12:54 < webczat:#liferay> hmm resizing portlets adds to the picture, doesn't it?
12:55 <@jhf:#liferay> I suppose...
12:56 < webczat:#liferay> I don't imagine myself seeing this accessible. but at least saying that I want the portlet to occupy the second column and lie below the topmost
12:56 < webczat:#liferay> would be great
12:56 <@jhf:#liferay> what if there are 3 columns?
12:56 < webczat:#liferay> what if you would add a selection of columns? like set a column, set where, set what etc
12:57 <@jhf:#liferay> there's another wrinkle: layout templates can also contain multiple sets of columns. so for example you have three columns at the top of the page, then a single column below that, then below that are two columns. so it's more like a grid from that perspective.
12:57 <@jhf:#liferay> 3-1-2
12:57 <@jhf:#liferay> or 3-2-3 or something.
12:58 < webczat:#liferay> :D:D:D
12:59 < webczat:#liferay> I would say i don't imagine myself seeing this really accessible and it's the thing I understand
12:59 < webczat:#liferay> because I don't know how a screenreader would ever be able to describe something like that
13:00 < webczat:#liferay> answering your question: it is possible to once ask how does this layout look like or something, then I can do what I want
13:02 <@jhf:#liferay> when you add a portlet to a page, it is done via client-side ajax and DOM manipulation.. I imagine screen readers don't take too kindly to that kind of in-place surgery?
13:03 < webczat:#liferay> no problem with it suddenly appearing, really
13:04 < mvlach:#liferay> hi all
13:04 < mvlach:#liferay> i have problem with thema
13:04 < webczat:#liferay> aye
13:04 < mvlach:#liferay> i created custom design and I want do use dockbar.css
13:05 < mvlach:#liferay> but the build remove this definition from css file
13:05 < mvlach:#liferay> know somebody why ?
13:05 < mvlach:#liferay> [java] Parsed /home/mvlach/liferay-plugins-sdk-6.2.0/themes/JVTheme-theme/docroot/css/dockbar.css in 95 ms
13:08 < apucay:#liferay> are your theme files not in the _diffs folder/
13:08 < apucay:#liferay> ?
13:12 < webczat:#liferay> jhf: what theme does liferay itself have?
13:12 <@jhf:#liferay> you mean liferay.com  (the website)?
13:13 < webczat:#liferay> yes
13:13 <@jhf:#liferay> it's a custom theme that's not open source :)
13:14 <@jhf:#liferay> also, liferay.com currently runs Liferay Portal 6.1 EE
13:14 < mvlach:#liferay> apucay: yes - my files are in _diff folder
13:15 < webczat:#liferay> okay, now a question. if an app says it's requirement is 6.1, does it mean 6.1 up so 6.2 too, or 6.1 only?
13:17 < apucay:#liferay> mvlach, and the build is removing it from the _diffs folder?
13:17 < webczat:#liferay> because it doesn't have a version for 6.2 but it may be compatiblee
13:17 <@jhf:#liferay> webczat: Marketplace apps, when they say "6.1+" means any 6.1, but NOT 6.2
13:17 <@jhf:#liferay> and when you're talking themes, it is most likely NOT going to work in 6.2 if it was built in 6.1.
13:18 <@jhf:#liferay> because of the major UI changes in 6.2 and associated incompatible css/js/html changes in themes.
13:18 < webczat:#liferay> oh my. so what now? was any theme created for 6.2 yet?
13:18 <@jhf:#liferay> it happens every release, unfortunately. themes are one of the last bastions of "too hard to really make compatible from release to release" however there is a tool that our UI team wrote to do most of the conversion from 6.1 to 6.2 if interested.
13:19 < webczat:#liferay> I'm not going to do any more hacks
13:19 <@jhf:#liferay> I don't think so, but work is in progress to upgrade the existing themes (at least those written by Liferay) to be 6.2 compatible.
13:20 < webczat:#liferay> so am I stuck? :D
13:20 < webczat:#liferay> I don't feel like downgrading
13:21 <@jhf:#liferay> so is the only thing blocking you the inability to add structures?
13:22 < webczat:#liferay> hmmm actually
13:22 < webczat:#liferay> structures, templates... all popups that are resized block me, I'm not sure if any other exist
13:23 <@jhf:#liferay> oh also.. can you try different browsers on that netbook? like firefox, chrome, IE.. see if they all have the same accessibility issue?
13:24 < webczat:#liferay> yes, I could. ie has a strange issue like it does not allow me to log in, liferay says that I should enable cookies while they are enabled. chrome hmm has probably the same accessibility problems + the next one because in chrome I don't see a label of many menus.
13:24 < webczat:#liferay> but I'm not sure if chrome is a very good browser for accessibility in general, although I could use it.
13:25 < webczat:#liferay> problems over problems :D
13:26 < webczat:#liferay> when liferay started it's accessibility work as a whole?
13:27 <@jhf:#liferay> a long time ago, actually.. it began with a "section 508 theme"
13:27 <@jhf:#liferay> way back in like 2007
13:27 < webczat:#liferay> mhm it's possible 6.1 was accessible. not sure though
13:27 <@jhf:#liferay> also, you may be interested in Julio's blog post: https://www.liferay.com/web/julio.camarero/blog/-/blogs/liferay-accessible-websites
13:27 <@jhf:#liferay> listing accessible sites built on Liferay
13:28 <@jhf:#liferay> and some other useful links
13:28 < webczat:#liferay> I would assay leray.com itself is rather accessible
13:28 < webczat:#liferay> *liferay.com
13:28 <@jhf:#liferay> yay!
13:28 <@jhf:#liferay> it's actually easier to make an accessible website as compared to making Liferay itself accessible :)
13:28 < webczat:#liferay> but too bad I don't have any theme
13:29 <@jhf:#liferay> well I imagine if you tried to access the administrative interfaces on liferay.com you'd run into issues.
13:29 < webczat:#liferay> maybe, but not necessarily
13:30 <@jhf:#liferay> although ,the theme is definitely simpler than the 6.2 one.. but there is also a separate theme for control panel, which you don't see on liferay.com, and it's likely not nearly as accessible
13:30 < webczat:#liferay> actually liferay's control panel is 100% accessible, site admin pages have problems, etc. popups have problems because they are mobile when the rest of the page is not
13:30 <@jhf:#liferay> ah so its the popups.. yeah 6.1 has much less popups.
13:31 < webczat:#liferay> not only but mainly. it's the theme's adaptive behaviour, not popups. popups itself are nice.
13:31 < webczat:#liferay> eee wait a while buhaha
13:34 < webczat:#liferay> ok, nothing. I probably had the screen turned to the horizontal position by accidental keypress
13:34 < webczat:#liferay> but it didn't change anything so nevermind
13:35 < webczat:#liferay> popups work. the problem is just when they are resized to the mobile standards
13:36 < webczat:#liferay> so not sure what are my options excluding switching to things like drupal (at least temporarily) or something
13:36 < webczat:#liferay> or to previous version of liferay
13:37 <@jhf:#liferay> I would see if you can make progress with Julio - my guess is it's a really simple fix, but I don't know anything about ARIA or accessibility so have to rely on the experts.
13:49 < webczat:#liferay> i'm just very impatient
13:50 < webczat:#liferay> those popups are problematic, impossible to disable completely
13:50 < webczat:#liferay> and always show the reduced theme so you never know what you miss unless it's as trivial as an add button
13:51 < webczat:#liferay> maybe portal.properties can disable or change a way the theme resizes?
13:55 < webczat:#liferay> btw what's minification? :D
13:59 <@jhf:#liferay> magnification? it is the stripping of whitespace and changing long variable names to short variable names
13:59 <@jhf:#liferay> from content that goes across the wire in textual form (e.g. css and javascript)
13:59 <@jhf:#liferay> the idea is to minimize network traffic and parsing effort
14:00 <@jhf:#liferay> so 'var superLongVar = 2 ;" becomes "var b=2;"
14:00 <@jhf:#liferay> then superLongVar is replaced with 'b' everywhere :)
14:00 <@jhf:#liferay> and so forth.. and so on..
14:01 < webczat:#liferay> nevermind
14:09 < webczat:#liferay> there is even a bug in the editor. if I'll add a link and then try to read this line, reading will stop at the link
14:09 < webczat:#liferay> I will not hear what the link is unless I use arrows
14:13 < webczat:#liferay> this is a minor issue when editing, major when you read something
14:15 < webczat:#liferay> because you don't know that you hit a link
14:16 <@jhf:#liferay> so you mean when your screenreader tries to read the content inside the WYSIWYG editor?
14:16 <@jhf:#liferay> what if you publish it out to a 'real' webpage, does it work as epxected?
14:17 < webczat:#liferay> it's just html. it would be really strange if it would not work
14:18 < webczat:#liferay> but in the editor, using arrows to read it triggers the bug. if you know that it's a link there you can use left/right and navigate to it and then it will work.
14:18 < webczat:#liferay> like I could edit links that I created in my mail notifications
14:18 <@jhf:#liferay> so when you said "major issue when you read something" - someone who is only reading something presumably is NOT using a WYSIWYG editor, but just reading the webpage as a traditional webpage, no?
14:19 < webczat:#liferay> but I couldn't see them when navigating line by line
14:19 < webczat:#liferay> by reading I meant reading in the editor. when you don't know what is it that you just need to edit and look around
14:20 < webczat:#liferay> the only thing I don't know is if it'll also happen if I'll put a link in a separate line.
14:20 <@jhf:#liferay> ah I see
14:20 <@jhf:#liferay> hmm
14:20 < webczat:#liferay> and not sure if it affects other things in the editor
14:21 < webczat:#liferay> too many accessibility bugs at once
14:23 < webczat:#liferay> I just want to make a website. So not sure if I want/can wait so long. not like it's time-constrained because it isn't. but it just took too long for me to set up my vm for it, I'm a lazy person :)
14:23 <@jhf:#liferay> coeditor is supposedly super-accessible
14:23 < webczat:#liferay> hm? :D
14:24 <@jhf:#liferay> http://ckeditor.com/blog/CKEditor-4.0.1-Released
14:24 <@jhf:#liferay> "CKEditor has a reputation for caring about accessibility, so this version includes numerous updates as well as improved Inline Editing compatibility with the JAWS screen reader."
14:24 <@jhf:#liferay> sooo
14:24 <@jhf:#liferay> maybe they don't test with NVDA :/
14:25 < webczat:#liferay> maybe
14:26 < webczat:#liferay> but when you read text, it's pretty good. as I sait, I know what I edit if it's not a link. and if I know where a link is, and navigate to it by character/etc, it says it's a link, i can see it, edit it etc
14:27 < webczat:#liferay> tested. worse if you don't know that you edit a link
14:27 < webczat:#liferay> or rather that here's a link. sometimes you know it because of the context of the sentence and sometimes you don't
14:27 < webczat:#liferay> editor menus/dialogs work.
14:29 < webczat:#liferay> what does liferay actually use?
14:30 <@jhf:#liferay> ckeditor 4.0.6
14:30 <@jhf:#liferay> err
14:30 <@jhf:#liferay> 4.0.3
14:30 < webczat:#liferay> mhm
14:31 < webczat:#liferay> actually a web editor like that is itself a very interesting idea for me when I'm used to normal textarea fields
14:32 < webczat:#liferay> and I can't believe it's still a webpage haha
14:32 < webczat:#liferay> I know what html5 can do but
14:32 < webczat:#liferay> I even know an accessible example of what html5 can do. like a game platform
14:33 < webczat:#liferay> it even includes the fact that nvda automatically reads what happens on the screen
14:34 < webczat:#liferay> so I must get used to the fact that html5 can do such things
14:37 < webczat:#liferay> so what would you recommend to do?
14:44 <@jhf:#liferay> can you post your findings to the ckeditor community and see if this is a known issue (and potentially find a workaround)?
14:46 < webczat:#liferay> this question was a general one, not for the ckeditor. it's one issue of few in liferay itself and I'm wondering what to try.
14:47 <@jhf:#liferay> I would write down all of the issues you've found so far, and post it to the accessibility forum (https://www.liferay.com/community/forums/-/message_boards/category/1229220)
14:48 < webczat:#liferay> why there?
14:48 <@jhf:#liferay> Julio can probably tell you straight away how much chance there is to get them fixed (or find suitable workarounds)
14:48 < webczat:#liferay> mhm
14:48 <@jhf:#liferay> it's the place where Liferay Accessibility questions go
14:49 <@jhf:#liferay> interesting.. the poland user group was the #2 most visited user group in december
14:49 < webczat:#liferay> if it would be possible to disable responsiveness...
14:49 < webczat:#liferay> whaaat? :D:D:D
14:50 < webczat:#liferay> maybe because of the really stupid translation errors? :D example: go to content was translated to "przejdź do komentarzy" and to my knowledge it would mean go to comments. :D
14:50 < webczat:#liferay> and some things were not translated at all
14:52 < webczat:#liferay> translation errors are okay as long as someone can fix them. because I could in theory do this, and because the maiin language of the website would be english, it's acceptable
14:53 < webczat:#liferay> accessibility bugs are not :)
14:53 < webczat:#liferay> like if no workarounds exist
15:01 <@jhf:#liferay> well guess what my friend
15:01 <@jhf:#liferay> translations are done through an automated website: translate.liferay.com
15:01 <@jhf:#liferay> http://translate.liferay.com/pootle/pl/portal/
15:01 <@jhf:#liferay> there are 11,017 words awaiting your contribution
15:02 <@jhf:#liferay> you ARE considering contributing, right? :)
15:02 <@jhf:#liferay> lets find that broken translation
15:02 <@jhf:#liferay> http://translate.liferay.com/pootle/pl/portal/Language_pl.properties/translate/?search=przejd%C5%BA+do+komentarzy&sfields=source&sfields=target
15:03 <@jhf:#liferay> someone didn't know what content meant (vs. commentary)
15:03 <@jhf:#liferay> clearly they need you :)
15:03 <@jhf:#liferay> so if you log in (using your liferay.com screen name and password)
15:03 <@jhf:#liferay> you will be able to provide the right translation
15:03 <@jhf:#liferay> it will be reviewed by the leaders for this language's translation
15:03 <@jhf:#liferay> and approved (most likely) in short order
15:04 <@jhf:#liferay> and then you can volunteer to become leader, so you can automatically approve your own suggestions :)
15:06 < webczat:#liferay> I'm not considering such things actually first because I'm not sure what will happen with my liferay installation, and also because I'm not sure if I will have time for that, I'm still at highschool.
