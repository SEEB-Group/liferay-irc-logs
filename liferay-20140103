06:22 < hufg:#liferay> helloo helloo
06:22 < hufg:#liferay> whats up
06:22 < hufg:#liferay> it's my last day on liferay :x
06:31 < topolik1:#liferay> hi hufg, was good to work with you!
06:32 < hufg:#liferay> hehe thanks thanks
06:33 < hufg:#liferay> no computer stuff for me for a year so i may write some blog posts and perhaps beat lps40416 with some megahack
07:50 < jardineworks:#liferay> hufg, no computer for a year? where you headed?
07:52 < hufg:#liferay> jardineworks: i'm doing civil service instead of army which will be hehe "janitor" at a school for teenagers aged 15-18
07:52 < jardineworks:#liferay> I guess that means that Finland still has conscription?
07:52 < hufg:#liferay> not too keen on fighting in wars caused by other peoples stupidity+greed
07:52 < hufg:#liferay> yes
07:54 < hufg:#liferay> it will be grreat, back to boxing, back to snowboarding and i have already paid for art lessons
07:55 < hufg:#liferay> 8)
07:55 < jardineworks:#liferay> that sounds awesome... and I couldnt agree more about the war non sense.
07:55 < jardineworks:#liferay> did your site go live yet?
07:55 < hufg:#liferay> no but it will ;)
07:55 < hufg:#liferay> i'll post a link once it comes
07:57 < jardineworks:#liferay> sounds good.
08:00 < hufg:#liferay> feeling good about it
08:00 < jardineworks:#liferay> so how does it work? does your company keep your position while you are away?
08:00 < hufg:#liferay> yes
08:00 < jardineworks:#liferay> or do you have to look for a new job in a year?
08:00 < hufg:#liferay> it's the law 8)
08:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> figured... makes sense
08:01 < hufg:#liferay> it's like a long unpaid vacation
08:02 < hufg:#liferay> during that time the you get your rent paid and some food in your mouth
08:02 < hufg:#liferay> and thats about it
08:03 < hufg:#liferay> and i guess no need for loan payments etc. and they will pay the interest
08:03 < jardineworks:#liferay> too bad you couldn't also go somewhere hot :)
08:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey topolik1 do you have a minute for a friendly url question?
08:05 < hufg:#liferay> hehe yeah
08:08 < hufg:#liferay> my first blog post would be "you suck, liferay doesn't"
08:08 < hufg:#liferay> a provocative tone to lessen the mythical aura of bullshit surrounding liferay
08:08 < hufg:#liferay> 8)
08:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> hahaha great title
08:09 < topolik1:#liferay> jardineworks: hi, try it :)
08:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik1, it's not working
08:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> :)
08:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> all the time...
08:10 < topolik1:#liferay> try harder :)
08:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> LOL
08:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> last night I did one, and it wasn't working... and then all of sudden magically it was working
08:10 < topolik1:#liferay> haha :D
08:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> this morning I am trying another which is also not working
08:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> and the magic still seems to be sleeping
