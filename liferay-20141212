02:36 < plekplek:#liferay> bijoo_: at least the 6.2CE doesn’t seem to have any localization for tags. categories, however, can be translated. i will be creating a place to gather image assets, and let people search for them using keywords in some form. tags sound more relevant, because that would let users add new tags on the fly to make assets easier to find
02:39 < plekplek:#liferay> bijoo_: but i’ll have a look at the hook way of solving it, that you mentioned. thanks!

04:53 < rrapozo:#liferay> Hey people!!!
04:54 < rrapozo:#liferay> I'm still having problems with translation!
09:15 < jardineworks:#liferay> happy Friday everyone!
09:21 < douglascrp:#liferay> jardineworks, :D
09:25 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> hi, anyone knows how to use expando of a layout in an  ftl theme?
09:27 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> jardineworks, any idea?
09:27 < jardineworks:#liferay> expando of a layout in ftl.
09:27 < jardineworks:#liferay> hmmm
09:28 < jardineworks:#liferay> avinashrbhat, what about using the taglib?
09:28 < jardineworks:#liferay> liferay-ui:custom-fields or something isn't it?
09:29 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> ok, let me check.
09:30 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> jardineworks, the vm file doesn't cause any error for this : $navLayout.getExpandoBridge().getAttribute("my-attribute"), but the same in ftl throws an NPE (in ftl: navLayout.getExpandoBridge().getAttribute('my-attribute))
10:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> avinashrbhat, did you try the taglib? .. even if you don't want to use it, just to see if it render the expando values...
10:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> in ftl I mean
10:03 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> jardineworks, it turns out, I had to check if there is the attribute in the expando, before attempting to get the value, the same code does work in velocity correctly, anyway, The root cause was that there wasn't a custom attribute with that value defined to start with. Now it seems to work.
10:03 < jardineworks:#liferay> hah
10:03 < jardineworks:#liferay> right.
