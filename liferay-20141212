02:36 < plekplek:#liferay> bijoo_: at least the 6.2CE doesn’t seem to have any localization for tags. categories, however, can be translated. i will be creating a place to gather image assets, and let people search for them using keywords in some form. tags sound more relevant, because that would let users add new tags on the fly to make assets easier to find
02:39 < plekplek:#liferay> bijoo_: but i’ll have a look at the hook way of solving it, that you mentioned. thanks!
