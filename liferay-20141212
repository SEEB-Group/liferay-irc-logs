02:36 < plekplek:#liferay> bijoo_: at least the 6.2CE doesn’t seem to have any localization for tags. categories, however, can be translated. i will be creating a place to gather image assets, and let people search for them using keywords in some form. tags sound more relevant, because that would let users add new tags on the fly to make assets easier to find
02:39 < plekplek:#liferay> bijoo_: but i’ll have a look at the hook way of solving it, that you mentioned. thanks!

04:53 < rrapozo:#liferay> Hey people!!!
04:54 < rrapozo:#liferay> I'm still having problems with translation!
09:15 < jardineworks:#liferay> happy Friday everyone!
09:21 < douglascrp:#liferay> jardineworks, :D
09:25 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> hi, anyone knows how to use expando of a layout in an  ftl theme?
09:27 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> jardineworks, any idea?
09:27 < jardineworks:#liferay> expando of a layout in ftl.
09:27 < jardineworks:#liferay> hmmm
09:28 < jardineworks:#liferay> avinashrbhat, what about using the taglib?
09:28 < jardineworks:#liferay> liferay-ui:custom-fields or something isn't it?
09:29 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> ok, let me check.
09:30 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> jardineworks, the vm file doesn't cause any error for this : $navLayout.getExpandoBridge().getAttribute("my-attribute"), but the same in ftl throws an NPE (in ftl: navLayout.getExpandoBridge().getAttribute('my-attribute))
10:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> avinashrbhat, did you try the taglib? .. even if you don't want to use it, just to see if it render the expando values...
10:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> in ftl I mean
10:03 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> jardineworks, it turns out, I had to check if there is the attribute in the expando, before attempting to get the value, the same code does work in velocity correctly, anyway, The root cause was that there wasn't a custom attribute with that value defined to start with. Now it seems to work.
10:03 < jardineworks:#liferay> hah
10:03 < jardineworks:#liferay> right.
10:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> velocity silently fails
10:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> which is one of the great things for runtime oopsies, but shitty things for debugging.
10:04 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> ya
10:06 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> ftl though is very unique & useful to use, as it supports taglibs, freaks out more than any other template libraries.
10:07 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> jardineworks, it's like running Java with a Javascript-like interpreter. you'll never know when hell will break loose. :-)
10:18 < jardineworks:#liferay> hahaha
10:18 < jardineworks:#liferay> I have recently found a love for JS though
10:18 < jardineworks:#liferay> all these years I thought we were mortal enemies ... but turns out we might actually be soul mates
10:32 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> jardineworks, these may interest you then, http://ericleads.com/2013/02/fluent-javascript-three-different-kinds-of-prototypal-oo/
10:32 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> that is one of my favorite JS articles.
10:33 < jardineworks:#liferay> avinashrbhat, thanks I'll check it out. I find myself more and more now writing all my portlets in JS and just using the serverResource method in my java class. Leverging the Liferay Client Side IPC stuff makes it super slick and sexy.
10:33 < jardineworks:#liferay> I'm super excited about Senna in the next release.
10:35 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> Senna?
10:35 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> jardineworks, Senna?
10:35 < jardineworks:#liferay> new JS framework Liferay is working on for Single Page applicaitons
10:35 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> ok
10:35 < jardineworks:#liferay> leverages all the wicked stuff in HTML5 like local storage to make for super fast apps.
10:36 < jardineworks:#liferay> senna is a famous F1 racer from brazil

12:00 < rockhopper:#liferay> hey.. anyone ever run into this issue LPS-40081 when PACL is enabled in GA3?
