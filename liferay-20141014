05:15 < Bilou:#liferay> jardineworks_, hi
05:15 < Bilou:#liferay> please jardineworks_ i have a technical question can you answer me
05:15 < Bilou:#liferay> please
06:08 < winem_:#liferay> let's hear your question
09:02 < jardineworks_:#liferay> Bilou, what's your question?
09:09 < jardineworks_:#liferay> hey winem_ -- how's it going?
09:10 < winem_:#liferay> thanks, stressful but fine. the priority on liferay has been decreased due to other projects
09:11 < douglascrp:#liferay> twen, are you the same twen on alfresco channel?
09:14 < jardineworks_:#liferay> winem_, that's always helpful :)
09:15 < jardineworks_:#liferay> winem_, Did you ever figure out that LAR issue you were having?
09:15 < winem_:#liferay> the admin has to do what the business says... ;)
09:16 < winem_:#liferay> yes, it was due to the JBoss wildfly and the new http implementation called undertow. it caused several problems. cookie handling, encoding of the user friendly url, some more issues with portlets
09:17 < winem_:#liferay> so we use jboss 7 (which is supported) and everything is fine now
09:23 < jardineworks_:#liferay> winem_, told you jboss was a bad decision :)
09:23 < jardineworks_:#liferay> haha
09:26 < winem_:#liferay> hehe, do you know the metaphor with the child and the hotplate? it does not believe that it's hot until it put it's hand on it :)
09:27 < jardineworks_:#liferay> My son actually did that
09:27 < jardineworks_:#liferay> now he believes :)
09:30 < twen:#liferay> douglascrp Yes, I am :)
09:31 < douglascrp:#liferay> wow... I didn't know you were a liferay user
09:33 < winem_:#liferay> great twen, so I have a question to you. what would you prefer as document management system: liferay social office or liferay + alfresco? :)
09:49 < Bilou:#liferay> jardineworks_,  http://www.liferay.com/community/forums/-/message_boards/message/43925526
09:54 < twen:#liferay> well, douglascrp  We have a current prohect using liferay... Dev is done by an outsourcing company... ^^
09:55 < twen:#liferay> winem_ My first rapid answer would be liferay + alfresco.. *BUT* we found out that Liferay has a big limitation with CMIS :(
