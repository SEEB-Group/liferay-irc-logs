05:45 < modd_:#liferay> hey jhf, thx for the access to the new area ;)
05:48 <@jhf:#liferay> ;) we’re still working on in too (in fact that’s my job for the next 2 weeks - make the “particpate” section be super-awesome)
05:48 <@jhf:#liferay> so your feedback is super valuable!
05:50 < modd_:#liferay> I'm still not sure if the navigation will work
05:51 < modd_:#liferay> if the amount of content will grow, the navigation will be like 2miles long^^
05:51 <@jhf:#liferay> hahahaha… well see, that’s good of you to give that kind of feedback! be sure to leave it on the site :)
05:52 < modd_:#liferay> I'll copy&paste it in a second^^
05:54 < modd_:#liferay> done ;)
05:55 < modd_:#liferay> this was my 4th feedback (two added as "comment" to an article and two using the feedback link - hope my thoughts are somekind of usefull :))

15:39 < jardineworks_:#liferay> hey jhf you around?
15:47 <@jhf:#liferay> yup
15:47 <@jhf:#liferay> whats up jardineworks_
15:48 < jardineworks_:#liferay> jhf, sorry -- was poking around. I'm learning about the resource importer stuff. Very cool -- though not a lot of details on how to use it. Have you done anything with it?
15:49 <@jhf:#liferay> not really - looked at its source a couple of times.. there’s a giant wiki page on it though
15:49 <@jhf:#liferay> have you found that?
15:51 < jardineworks_:#liferay> possibly.. shoot me the link if you have it jandy in case I havent
15:51 < jardineworks_:#liferay> I have seen a couple of different ones
15:52 <@jhf:#liferay> https://www.liferay.com/community/wiki/-/wiki/Main/Resources+Importer+Web
15:52 < jardineworks_:#liferay> yeah -- was looking at this one
15:53 < jardineworks_:#liferay> I wish there was some resource that outlined all the options -- but I guess you just need to look at the deserialized objects?
15:53 <@jhf:#liferay> ah wait - that wiki is old, it’s been sedimented into the official docs
15:53 <@jhf:#liferay> https://www.liferay.com/documentation/liferay-portal/6.2/development/-/ai/importing-resources-with-your-themes-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-09-en
15:53 < jardineworks_:#liferay> ah
15:54 < jardineworks_:#liferay> that is the one I am looking at right now
15:54 < jardineworks_:#liferay> my public and private pages both get slotted into public pages.
15:54 <@jhf:#liferay> the example on that docs page shows how to make private layouts too
15:54 <@jhf:#liferay> does it not work?
15:55 < jardineworks_:#liferay> you mean this? ---
15:55 < jardineworks_:#liferay> "privatePages": [
15:55 < jardineworks_:#liferay>     {
15:55 < jardineworks_:#liferay>         "friendlyURL": "/private-page",
15:55 < jardineworks_:#liferay>     "name": "Private Page",
15:55 < jardineworks_:#liferay>     "title": "Private Page"
15:55 < jardineworks_:#liferay>     }
15:55 < jardineworks_:#liferay> ],
15:55 < jardineworks_:#liferay> "publicPages": [
15:55 < jardineworks_:#liferay> that is what I am doing, but all my private pages are showing up in the public pages list for the site template.
15:56 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah that
