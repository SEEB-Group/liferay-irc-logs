09:19 < jardineworks:#liferay> waltercool, someone is awake now :)
09:20 < douglascrp:#liferay> hey jardineworks
09:22 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey douglascrp -- how's it going?
09:24 < douglascrp:#liferay> fine
09:25 < douglascrp:#liferay> I'm about to deliver the first version of the project I'm working on
09:25 < douglascrp:#liferay> jardineworks, do you have any advice on how to speed up the UI development?
09:25 < douglascrp:#liferay> I've spent most of the time on the UI part
09:26 < douglascrp:#liferay> and I can't say it's beautiful ;D
09:28 < jardineworks:#liferay> douglascrp, definitely. my advice would be to hire a UI expert :)
09:28 < douglascrp:#liferay> jardineworks, I know that... lol
09:28 < jardineworks:#liferay> a front end guy that can bang out the HTML stuff in no time :)
09:29 < douglascrp:#liferay> but I'm talking about the technology
09:29 < douglascrp:#liferay> do you use jsp too?
09:29 < jardineworks:#liferay> short of that, I think using the Liferay taglibs as much as possible would be a good start, but I think it takes practice to learn all the CSS that you need to override to make it look the way you want it to.
09:30 < jardineworks:#liferay> douglascrp, I do -- although I am doing more and more JS with ajax call backs. Liferay 7 has some awesome road mapped features that are going to allow for SEO and stuff to be preserved while at the same time making the site rich and ajaxy :)
09:31 < douglascrp:#liferay> nice
10:44 < winem_:#liferay> hey guys, I think about using liferay as portal server for small node.js applications. is it a good idea? looks like there are not so many out there using node.js portlets
10:59 < jardineworks:#liferay> winem_, never done it -- but can't think of a reason why not too
10:59 < winem_:#liferay> great, same about me
11:00 < winem_:#liferay> but I have another (old) issue... the one with the missing dockbar where I spent a few hours per day
11:00 < winem_:#liferay> now I found the real case. the dockbar disappears on the website as soon as I define a public or private url / virtual host
11:00 < winem_:#liferay> is this the default behaviour from liferay?!
11:00 < jardineworks:#liferay> :|
11:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> should't be
11:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> I mean, if you are logged in, then you should see the dockbar and the content should be based on whatever permissions you have
11:01 < winem_:#liferay> can reproduce this on 2 hosts using the liferay + jboss bundle
11:02 < jardineworks:#liferay> winem_, without any custom theme deployed?
11:02 < winem_:#liferay> this is what I expect too. but the dockbar on the website itself is only shown if there is no page url defined in the site url settings
11:02 < winem_:#liferay> with a custom theme... naaah... it's a circle of death
11:02 < winem_:#liferay> let me check it with another template..
11:03 < jardineworks:#liferay> winem_, if you wanna see if its a Liferay bug, always check with the stock bundle :)
11:03 < jardineworks:#liferay> no themes nadda
11:05 < winem_:#liferay> yes, did this before but now I thought I found the cause and ignored the things I check before with the theme, js, and so on.. :)
11:05 < winem_:#liferay> and yes, it's still theme related
11:06 < jardineworks:#liferay> winem_, so you saw the same issue without any custom code applied?
11:06 < winem_:#liferay> but all the themes include the #dockbar.. I'm so damn confused..
11:06 < jardineworks:#liferay> but #dockbar just injects html from the velocity macro right?
11:06 < winem_:#liferay> no, I have the dockbar when I choose one of the two default schemes from liferay
11:07 < jardineworks:#liferay> so it's probably that there is some custom css that is making it "disappear"
11:07 < winem_:#liferay> you're the UI guy. I'm just the stupid ops guy :)
11:07 < jardineworks:#liferay> can you see the dockbar code in the page source?
11:07 < winem_:#liferay> I hope it's not... this is what I said from the beginning but all the developers told me that it's a server issue...
11:07 < winem_:#liferay> anything special I should search for?
11:08 < jardineworks:#liferay> 6.2 right?
11:08 < winem_:#liferay> yes
11:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> one sec
11:09 < winem_:#liferay> would wait all night if it helps to fix the issue ;)
11:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> aria-label="Dockbar"
11:10 < winem_:#liferay> ich schau mal
11:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> or maybe id="_145_navAccountControls"
11:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> or role="menubar"
11:11 < winem_:#liferay> ok, found it with the default theme
11:11 < winem_:#liferay> being back in a minute
11:31 < waltercool:#liferay> jardineworks: a little question :P Using JSF, there is a method to validate Captcha?
11:32 < jardineworks:#liferay> waltercool, awww sorry man, I don't know anything about JSF
11:34 < waltercool:#liferay> awww :( Is pretty hard to findstuff about JSF, I only can find about JSP
11:36 < jardineworks:#liferay> waltercool, I know. JSF is gaining support I think (the Liferay Faces specifically) but it's still "newish" I think. Best bet is to crawl the source... its open right :)
11:38 < waltercool:#liferay> jardineworks: Yeah, but I was looking on the Captcha implementations, and I don't find lot of info
11:39 < waltercool:#liferay> I just find a method to compare your captcha with an HttpRequest and a facesContext
11:39 < jardineworks:#liferay> waltercool, there is a CaptchaUtil class that would probably do it for you
11:40 < waltercool:#liferay> Yeah, CaptchaUtil.getCatcha was the class to obtain the Captcha, but then, I can't find a method like captcha.compare(String)
11:41 < jardineworks:#liferay> waltercool, what does CaptchaUtil.check() do?
11:42 < jardineworks:#liferay> waltercool, the default class is SimpleCaptchaImpl... and the check method looks like it just checks the attempts :)
11:44 < jardineworks:#liferay> waltercool, there is also a validateChallenge method
11:44 < jardineworks:#liferay> 	protected boolean validateChallenge(HttpServletRequest request)
11:44 < jardineworks:#liferay> specifically
11:44 < waltercool:#liferay> jardineworks: Yeah, but I don't know what's I need to use as parameter on check(), there is a ... HttpServletRequest and a PortletRequest, that means, or I just use the current one?
11:45 < jardineworks:#liferay> aha
11:45 < jardineworks:#liferay> its the check
11:45 < jardineworks:#liferay> well,.. normally they'r overloaded.
11:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> so you call it with PortletRequest and it will internally get the HttpServletRequest and call the other
11:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> bottom line, it doesn;t matter
11:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> :)
11:47 < waltercool:#liferay> jardineworks: But I need to tell, that's the text used by the user, that's the captcha... compare it
11:47 < waltercool:#liferay> Because the Liferay default implementation it's only a captcha text, no input dialog for that
11:47 < waltercool:#liferay> I can use a JSF tag to make the validation, but I can't take it into the ManagedBean
11:49 < jardineworks:#liferay> see-- this is where I start the blank stare because I don't know anything about JSF :)
11:49 < waltercool:#liferay> yeah, I know :(
11:50 < jardineworks:#liferay> so what I envision is... user sees the captcha... enters a value.. hits submit... action handler on the server receives the ActionRequest (which is a PortletRequest) and you use the CaptchaUtil.check( actionRequest ); and based on the result... take action.
11:52 < waltercool:#liferay> I will make the try, I don't like a lot only client side validation
11:52 < waltercool:#liferay> @jardineworks thank you
11:52 < jardineworks:#liferay> np
12:06 < winem_:#liferay> never answer a call from a woman and think you'll finish it in a minute...
12:36 < jardineworks:#liferay> winem_, haha
12:50 < winem_:#liferay> jardingeworks aria-label=dockbar does not appear in the source code
12:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> winem_, boo
12:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> so the dockbar is not rendered at all
12:52 < winem_:#liferay> ok, so it's definitely a css issue?
12:52 < jardineworks:#liferay> winem_, unlikely
12:53 < jardineworks:#liferay> see if it was a css issue then I would expect the code to be there, but the tag that wraps it have a value set so that it is not visible (hidden).
12:53 < winem_:#liferay> what else? :-/
12:53 < jardineworks:#liferay> in this case, the code is not there which means that the response object coming back to the browser doesn't have it .. which means the code that generates the page doesnt put it in the page.
12:53 < jardineworks:#liferay> hmmm
12:53 < jardineworks:#liferay> do you see #dockbar in the code?
12:53 < jardineworks:#liferay> :)
12:54 < winem_:#liferay> have to go home first.. will be back in a hour I think
12:54 < jardineworks:#liferay> ... it should be #dockbar()
