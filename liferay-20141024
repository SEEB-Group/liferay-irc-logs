09:19 < jardineworks:#liferay> waltercool, someone is awake now :)
09:20 < douglascrp:#liferay> hey jardineworks
09:22 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey douglascrp -- how's it going?
09:24 < douglascrp:#liferay> fine
09:25 < douglascrp:#liferay> I'm about to deliver the first version of the project I'm working on
09:25 < douglascrp:#liferay> jardineworks, do you have any advice on how to speed up the UI development?
09:25 < douglascrp:#liferay> I've spent most of the time on the UI part
09:26 < douglascrp:#liferay> and I can't say it's beautiful ;D
09:28 < jardineworks:#liferay> douglascrp, definitely. my advice would be to hire a UI expert :)
09:28 < douglascrp:#liferay> jardineworks, I know that... lol
09:28 < jardineworks:#liferay> a front end guy that can bang out the HTML stuff in no time :)
09:29 < douglascrp:#liferay> but I'm talking about the technology
09:29 < douglascrp:#liferay> do you use jsp too?
09:29 < jardineworks:#liferay> short of that, I think using the Liferay taglibs as much as possible would be a good start, but I think it takes practice to learn all the CSS that you need to override to make it look the way you want it to.
09:30 < jardineworks:#liferay> douglascrp, I do -- although I am doing more and more JS with ajax call backs. Liferay 7 has some awesome road mapped features that are going to allow for SEO and stuff to be preserved while at the same time making the site rich and ajaxy :)
09:31 < douglascrp:#liferay> nice
10:44 < winem_:#liferay> hey guys, I think about using liferay as portal server for small node.js applications. is it a good idea? looks like there are not so many out there using node.js portlets
10:59 < jardineworks:#liferay> winem_, never done it -- but can't think of a reason why not too
10:59 < winem_:#liferay> great, same about me
11:00 < winem_:#liferay> but I have another (old) issue... the one with the missing dockbar where I spent a few hours per day
11:00 < winem_:#liferay> now I found the real case. the dockbar disappears on the website as soon as I define a public or private url / virtual host
11:00 < winem_:#liferay> is this the default behaviour from liferay?!
11:00 < jardineworks:#liferay> :|
11:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> should't be
11:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> I mean, if you are logged in, then you should see the dockbar and the content should be based on whatever permissions you have
11:01 < winem_:#liferay> can reproduce this on 2 hosts using the liferay + jboss bundle
11:02 < jardineworks:#liferay> winem_, without any custom theme deployed?
11:02 < winem_:#liferay> this is what I expect too. but the dockbar on the website itself is only shown if there is no page url defined in the site url settings
11:02 < winem_:#liferay> with a custom theme... naaah... it's a circle of death
11:02 < winem_:#liferay> let me check it with another template..
11:03 < jardineworks:#liferay> winem_, if you wanna see if its a Liferay bug, always check with the stock bundle :)
11:03 < jardineworks:#liferay> no themes nadda
11:05 < winem_:#liferay> yes, did this before but now I thought I found the cause and ignored the things I check before with the theme, js, and so on.. :)
11:05 < winem_:#liferay> and yes, it's still theme related
11:06 < jardineworks:#liferay> winem_, so you saw the same issue without any custom code applied?
11:06 < winem_:#liferay> but all the themes include the #dockbar.. I'm so damn confused..
11:06 < jardineworks:#liferay> but #dockbar just injects html from the velocity macro right?
11:06 < winem_:#liferay> no, I have the dockbar when I choose one of the two default schemes from liferay
11:07 < jardineworks:#liferay> so it's probably that there is some custom css that is making it "disappear"
11:07 < winem_:#liferay> you're the UI guy. I'm just the stupid ops guy :)
11:07 < jardineworks:#liferay> can you see the dockbar code in the page source?
11:07 < winem_:#liferay> I hope it's not... this is what I said from the beginning but all the developers told me that it's a server issue...
11:07 < winem_:#liferay> anything special I should search for?
11:08 < jardineworks:#liferay> 6.2 right?
11:08 < winem_:#liferay> yes
11:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> one sec
