09:19 < jardineworks:#liferay> waltercool, someone is awake now :)
09:20 < douglascrp:#liferay> hey jardineworks
09:22 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey douglascrp -- how's it going?
09:24 < douglascrp:#liferay> fine
09:25 < douglascrp:#liferay> I'm about to deliver the first version of the project I'm working on
09:25 < douglascrp:#liferay> jardineworks, do you have any advice on how to speed up the UI development?
09:25 < douglascrp:#liferay> I've spent most of the time on the UI part
09:26 < douglascrp:#liferay> and I can't say it's beautiful ;D
09:28 < jardineworks:#liferay> douglascrp, definitely. my advice would be to hire a UI expert :)
09:28 < douglascrp:#liferay> jardineworks, I know that... lol
09:28 < jardineworks:#liferay> a front end guy that can bang out the HTML stuff in no time :)
09:29 < douglascrp:#liferay> but I'm talking about the technology
09:29 < douglascrp:#liferay> do you use jsp too?
09:29 < jardineworks:#liferay> short of that, I think using the Liferay taglibs as much as possible would be a good start, but I think it takes practice to learn all the CSS that you need to override to make it look the way you want it to.
09:30 < jardineworks:#liferay> douglascrp, I do -- although I am doing more and more JS with ajax call backs. Liferay 7 has some awesome road mapped features that are going to allow for SEO and stuff to be preserved while at the same time making the site rich and ajaxy :)
09:31 < douglascrp:#liferay> nice
