04:52 < jagget:#liferay> hi, people
04:52 < jagget:#liferay> is anybody here alive?
06:50 < doged:#liferay> is it possible to run liferay  in aws  or app egnine?
07:42 < winem_:#liferay> I would recommend the liferay + tomcat bundle to run it on an aws host
08:08 < doged:#liferay> it works without bigger changes?
08:09 < winem_:#liferay> did not test it on an aws host yet, but on different servers and an environment of one of our customers and it worked out of the box
08:09 < winem_:#liferay> download, extract and run. you might just have to create the portal-ext.properties
08:16 < douglascrp:#liferay> hey guys
08:17 < douglascrp:#liferay> I have a form where I use the form-navigator component
08:18 < douglascrp:#liferay> does anyone know if it's possible to create a action link to take the user to this form, but having the right option already selected in the form-navigator?
08:18 < douglascrp:#liferay> I have 4 sections on it, but if I use the default action link, navigation is redirected to the first section
08:19 < douglascrp:#liferay> I'd like to have to option to take the user to, lets say, the 3th section
08:19 < douglascrp:#liferay> 3rd
08:20 < douglascrp:#liferay> actually, I'm using a renderURL, like this
08:20 < douglascrp:#liferay> <portlet:renderURL var="editURL">
