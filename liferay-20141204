04:52 < jagget:#liferay> hi, people
04:52 < jagget:#liferay> is anybody here alive?
06:50 < doged:#liferay> is it possible to run liferay  in aws  or app egnine?
07:42 < winem_:#liferay> I would recommend the liferay + tomcat bundle to run it on an aws host
08:08 < doged:#liferay> it works without bigger changes?
08:09 < winem_:#liferay> did not test it on an aws host yet, but on different servers and an environment of one of our customers and it worked out of the box
08:09 < winem_:#liferay> download, extract and run. you might just have to create the portal-ext.properties
08:16 < douglascrp:#liferay> hey guys
08:17 < douglascrp:#liferay> I have a form where I use the form-navigator component
08:18 < douglascrp:#liferay> does anyone know if it's possible to create a action link to take the user to this form, but having the right option already selected in the form-navigator?
08:18 < douglascrp:#liferay> I have 4 sections on it, but if I use the default action link, navigation is redirected to the first section
08:19 < douglascrp:#liferay> I'd like to have to option to take the user to, lets say, the 3th section
08:19 < douglascrp:#liferay> 3rd
08:20 < douglascrp:#liferay> actually, I'm using a renderURL, like this
08:20 < douglascrp:#liferay> <portlet:renderURL var="editURL">
08:20 < douglascrp:#liferay> 		<portlet:param name="mvcPath" value="/html/projetos/edit_projeto.jsp" />
08:20 < douglascrp:#liferay> 		<portlet:param name="projetoId" value="<%=String.valueOf(projetoId)%>" />
08:20 < douglascrp:#liferay> 		<portlet:param name="redirect" value="<%=redirect%>" />
08:20 < douglascrp:#liferay> 	</portlet:renderURL>
08:38 < douglascrp:#liferay> never mind guys... I've just found the solution
08:38 < douglascrp:#liferay> add the parameter historyKey with the section name, just like this
08:38 < douglascrp:#liferay> <portlet:param name="historyKey" value="Proponente" />
08:38 < douglascrp:#liferay> and the desired section will be selected
09:02 < winem_:#liferay> good job douglascrp
09:58 < jardineworks:#liferay> any aui rockstars in the house?
09:58 < jardineworks:#liferay> I know that there is a fancy pants JS way to do what I am doing in one line of code rather than 10
09:58 < jardineworks:#liferay> :)
09:59 < jardineworks:#liferay> I want all the nodes with a class 'single' line ... which I can do with A.all('single-line) ...
09:59 < jardineworks:#liferay> BUT
09:59 < jardineworks:#liferay> I also want to make it so that I further narrow the list to just items what contain an text value of 'xxxxx'
