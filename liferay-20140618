07:09 < modd_:#liferay> hi rotty3000: I guess I found some issues with the search portlet. did the way it filters facets change for categories? I remember that it used to be an assetCategoryTitles parameter, now it's an assetCategoryIds parameter
07:12 < modd_:#liferay> the main_search_document_form.jsp uses the old parameter name to build the url, therefore it doesn't work anymore
07:13 < modd_:#liferay> and changing the checkboxes in the basic configuration deletes the whole content of the extended config and the search doesn't do what one would expect
07:13 < modd_:#liferay> anyone able to reproduce?
07:16 < modd_:#liferay> maybe jhf ;)
08:16 < modd_:#liferay> seems like this was fixed: https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/blob/master/portal-web/docroot/html/portlet/search/main_search_result_form.jsp#L210
08:16 < modd_:#liferay> but not this: https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/blob/master/portal-web/docroot/html/portlet/search/main_search_document_form.jsp#L130
08:43 < modd_:#liferay> the token_list is also broken after these changes
08:46 < Yam`:#liferay> Hello, I've set up a Liferay Portal and done a silly thing : in order to test a LDAP connexion, I've modified authentification from "with mail address" to "with user ID". But I don't know the admin's user ID so I can't log anymore with it... Do you know the default admin's user ID or a way to fix my mistake?
08:46 < modd_:#liferay> take a look into your database
08:47 < modd_:#liferay> the users table will give you the information
08:47 < modd_:#liferay> usually for ldap one would need authentification by screenname
09:13 < Yam`:#liferay> thanks modd_ !
09:14 < modd_:#liferay> np
09:22 < Yam`:#liferay> I've added my LDAP server, when I test LDAP connection it's ok and when I test ldap users it's ok too, I see the screen names etc. I've set authentification by Screen Name in the control panel but I can't login with a use, have I missed something to set up?
09:23 < modd_:#liferay> well, ldap will import your user
09:23 < modd_:#liferay> for SSO you have to activate NTLM
09:25 < Yam`:#liferay> I'm not trying SSO yet, I try to log in with the user screen name and his password in liferay's login page
09:25 < modd_:#liferay> ah ok
09:25 < modd_:#liferay> do you see your user in the list in the control panel?
09:25 < Yam`:#liferay> yes
09:25 < Yam`:#liferay> (there's only one user)
09:26 < modd_:#liferay> so you see this user when testing the connection but also in the liferay users list?
09:27 < Yam`:#liferay> ah no, I see it when testing the connection
09:27 < Yam`:#liferay> where is the users list?
09:28 < modd_:#liferay> lr 6.2?
09:28 < Yam`:#liferay> yes
09:28 < modd_:#liferay> control panel > on the left side you'll see "user"
09:29 < Yam`:#liferay> oh right, I searched it in configuration
09:29 < modd_:#liferay> you have to activate ldap import and wait for one interval
09:30 < Yam`:#liferay> the user's not in there
09:30 < modd_:#liferay> otherwise you can trigger an import by hand using the liferay console in the server configuration
09:30 < Yam`:#liferay> ok.
09:30 < Yam`:#liferay> one interval means?
09:30 < modd_:#liferay> usually 10min
09:30 < modd_:#liferay> AFAIR
09:30 < Yam`:#liferay> k, thanks
09:31 < modd_:#liferay> or in the control panel on the right side you have server administration
09:31 < Yam`:#liferay> so I just check "Import enabled" in LDAP configuration, I save and I wait?
09:31 < modd_:#liferay> and then a tab with "console" or something like that
09:31 < modd_:#liferay> yes
09:31 < Yam`:#liferay> ty
09:31 < modd_:#liferay> using the console simply delete the content and paste this and start: "Packages.com.liferay.portal.security.ldap.PortalLDAPImporterUtil.importFromLDAP();"
09:33 < Yam`:#liferay> mhh, I'm checking that but I don't see a tab with "console"
