07:09 < modd_:#liferay> hi rotty3000: I guess I found some issues with the search portlet. did the way it filters facets change for categories? I remember that it used to be an assetCategoryTitles parameter, now it's an assetCategoryIds parameter
07:12 < modd_:#liferay> the main_search_document_form.jsp uses the old parameter name to build the url, therefore it doesn't work anymore
07:13 < modd_:#liferay> and changing the checkboxes in the basic configuration deletes the whole content of the extended config and the search doesn't do what one would expect
07:13 < modd_:#liferay> anyone able to reproduce?
07:16 < modd_:#liferay> maybe jhf ;)
08:16 < modd_:#liferay> seems like this was fixed: https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/blob/master/portal-web/docroot/html/portlet/search/main_search_result_form.jsp#L210
08:16 < modd_:#liferay> but not this: https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/blob/master/portal-web/docroot/html/portlet/search/main_search_document_form.jsp#L130
08:43 < modd_:#liferay> the token_list is also broken after these changes
08:46 < Yam`:#liferay> Hello, I've set up a Liferay Portal and done a silly thing : in order to test a LDAP connexion, I've modified authentification from "with mail address" to "with user ID". But I don't know the admin's user ID so I can't log anymore with it... Do you know the default admin's user ID or a way to fix my mistake?
08:46 < modd_:#liferay> take a look into your database
08:47 < modd_:#liferay> the users table will give you the information
08:47 < modd_:#liferay> usually for ldap one would need authentification by screenname
09:13 < Yam`:#liferay> thanks modd_ !
09:14 < modd_:#liferay> np
