06:38 < sm`pid:#liferay> Hello
06:38 < sm`pid:#liferay> jardineworks: i tried your suggestion
06:38 < sm`pid:#liferay> put _eGain_WAR_Egainportlet_javax.portlet.action  in the rule
06:39 < sm`pid:#liferay> but didnt work either.
06:39 < sm`pid:#liferay> with such config the linked are not matched with the rule i.e. i dont get the friendly urls
07:02 < sl33k:#liferay> hi guys
07:02 < sl33k:#liferay> grrr
07:03 < sl33k:#liferay> that render/action 2 phase cycle bore things up for spring mvc portlet integration
07:03 < sl33k:#liferay> example, action phase gets student and passes to render method for display.
