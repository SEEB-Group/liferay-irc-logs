06:38 < sm`pid:#liferay> Hello
06:38 < sm`pid:#liferay> jardineworks: i tried your suggestion
06:38 < sm`pid:#liferay> put _eGain_WAR_Egainportlet_javax.portlet.action  in the rule
06:39 < sm`pid:#liferay> but didnt work either.
06:39 < sm`pid:#liferay> with such config the linked are not matched with the rule i.e. i dont get the friendly urls
07:02 < sl33k:#liferay> hi guys
07:02 < sl33k:#liferay> grrr
07:03 < sl33k:#liferay> that render/action 2 phase cycle bore things up for spring mvc portlet integration
07:03 < sl33k:#liferay> example, action phase gets student and passes to render method for display.
07:04 < sl33k:#liferay> next time that display runs, if student isnt set, it shows null
07:04 < sl33k:#liferay> this is bad

08:00 < modd_:#liferay> hi lundgren
08:00 < modd_:#liferay> I heard you are "the man" for workflows ;)
08:09 <@lundgren:#liferay> modd_: well... depends on what part of it
08:09 < modd_:#liferay> we want to replace kaleo with camunda
08:10 < modd_:#liferay> does any kind of documentation exist, which gives some hints what we have to implement and what not to forget while doing it
08:10 < modd_:#liferay> we want to use camunda for all liferay workflows
08:10 < modd_:#liferay> like the activity portlet
08:11 < modd_:#liferay> but as an extern server
08:12 < topolik:#liferay> sl33k: the action phase is for UPDATE, render phase for READ operations
