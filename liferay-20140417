19:56 < Naenyn> grr.. my UserLocalServiceWrapper hook doesn't seem to be doing anything .. even though it deploys fine. =\
19:57 < bijoo__> Naenyn: it's supposed to override the methods?
19:58 < Naenyn> It overrides two (add and create) .. I'm guessing I'm missing a piece of the puzzle. Maybe it should have been extending the UserServiceWrapper instead.. Does the normal user creation process via the control panel use UserLocalService or UserService?
20:00 < bijoo__> UserServiceUtil
20:00 < bijoo__> com.liferay.portlet.usersadmin.action.EditUserAction.addUser(ActionRequest)
20:01 < bijoo__> Naenyn: that's from 6.1GA2 though, may check.
20:01 < Naenyn> bijoo__: how'd you find that out?
20:02 < bijoo__> Naenyn: Import the liferay source into eclipse; in eclipse, press Ctrl+Shift+R; search for "EditUserAction.java" and open it.
20:03 < bijoo__> Naenyn: other way : press Ctrl+Shift+R , search "*users_*/*" select edit_user. See the line "<portlet:actionURL><portlet:param name="struts_action" value="/users_admin/edit_user" /></portlet:actionURL>");"
20:04 < bijoo__> Naenyn: then in Eclipse, Ctrl+Shift+R "tiles-defs.xml" look for 'edit_user"'
20:04 < bijoo__> Naenyn: rather, Ctrl+Shift+R "struts-config.xml" look for 'edit_user"'
20:05 < bijoo__> Naenyn: and it's mapped to EditUserAction
20:08 < Naenyn> bijoo__: Hm.. think I'm missing where you jumped to that from the user add form.
20:11 < Naenyn> still not too good at figuring out what gets called on form submits. =]
20:48 < bijoo__> Naenyn: general process is something like this: (1) find jsp, (2) find form struts action - check form url and/or portlet render/action/resource url (3)  lookup the struts path in struts-config.xml (4) open the referenced mapped Action class
