19:56 < Naenyn> grr.. my UserLocalServiceWrapper hook doesn't seem to be doing anything .. even though it deploys fine. =\
19:57 < bijoo__> Naenyn: it's supposed to override the methods?
19:58 < Naenyn> It overrides two (add and create) .. I'm guessing I'm missing a piece of the puzzle. Maybe it should have been extending the UserServiceWrapper instead.. Does the normal user creation process via the control panel use UserLocalService or UserService?
