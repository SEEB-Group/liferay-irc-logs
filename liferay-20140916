02:19 < Axxell:#liferay> Hey guys, repeating the question from yesterday: Liferay 6.2 GA1 does not have the ability to sort articles in the control panel according to title, i tried to add that with a hook but got the error ERROR [http-bio-8080-exec-7][JDBCExceptionReporter:82] Unknown column 'title' in 'order clause' in the file \webapps\ROOT\html\portlet\journal\sort_button.jsp
02:20 < Axxell:#liferay> it was possible in liferay 6.1 to sort with any of the headers of the table but not in 6.2 ga1. Problem is that i have a lot of articles on my site and finding them when the search does not return all the files you would want to, is very difficult
