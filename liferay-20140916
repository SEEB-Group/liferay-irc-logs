02:19 < Axxell:#liferay> Hey guys, repeating the question from yesterday: Liferay 6.2 GA1 does not have the ability to sort articles in the control panel according to title, i tried to add that with a hook but got the error ERROR [http-bio-8080-exec-7][JDBCExceptionReporter:82] Unknown column 'title' in 'order clause' in the file \webapps\ROOT\html\portlet\journal\sort_button.jsp
