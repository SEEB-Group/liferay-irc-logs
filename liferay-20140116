02:21 < dm-o:#liferay> good morning everyone
02:23 < dm-o:#liferay> i got a hopefully simple question. Is it possible to use life ray as a system for quality management? we`ve got hundreds of documents in revisions and want an automated process for release of new documents or sending em back for changes to the author by a user.
02:26 < satheesh:#liferay> dm-o: Yeah. Its possible
