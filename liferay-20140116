02:21 < dm-o:#liferay> good morning everyone
02:23 < dm-o:#liferay> i got a hopefully simple question. Is it possible to use life ray as a system for quality management? we`ve got hundreds of documents in revisions and want an automated process for release of new documents or sending em back for changes to the author by a user.
02:26 < satheesh:#liferay> dm-o: Yeah. Its possible
02:27 < dm-o:#liferay> hi satheesh thank you for your answer. Is it a "build-in" feature of the community edition? I did not found any examples via google.
02:28 < dm-o:#liferay> we need it for document control with company header on each document and foot print etc.
02:30 < satheesh:#liferay> 1. Document Versioning
02:30 < satheesh:#liferay> 2. Single Approver workflow
02:31 < satheesh:#liferay> Are  built-in functionality for CE
02:32 < satheesh:#liferay> "built-in" is also called as out-of-the-box functionality
02:47 < dm-o:#liferay> thank you for the information satheesh i will give it a try as a company intranet now
02:49 < dm-o:#liferay> bye bye for now
02:49 < dm-o:#liferay> :away
02:49 < dm-o:#liferay> :help
03:12 < satheesh:#liferay> cool
03:48 < quercus:#liferay> is just me or do you get proxy error also from here: https://repository.liferay.com/nexus/content/groups/liferay-ce/com/liferay/portal/portal-client/6.2.0-ga1/portal-client-6.2.0-ga1.pom ?
04:10 < satheesh:#liferay> quercus: I'm getting the proxy error
04:10 < satheesh:#liferay> https://repository.liferay.com/nexus/content/groups/liferay-ce/com/liferay/portal/portal-client/6.2.0-ga1/
04:24 < quercus:#liferay> ok, thanks for confirming this.
04:25 < satheesh:#liferay> welcome
08:40 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> hi there
08:50 < kim_:#liferay> Ho can i login as admin when SSO is enabled?
08:58 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> has anyone seen this error? "java.awt.image.RasterFormatException: Incorrect scanline stride: 4"
09:03 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> not here
09:35 <@jhf:#liferay> avinashrbhat: yep thats a known issue
09:35 <@jhf:#liferay> it's due to a change in one of the JDK runtime libraries that Liferay was not expecting :)
09:37 <@jhf:#liferay> see https://issues.liferay.com/browse/LPS-37433 for workarounds and details
09:37 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> jhf, hmm, saw the issue myself, i have changed all the grayscale images to RGB, still no changes
09:37 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> ya that one itself
09:40 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> jhf, is there any way to find the image that causes this?
09:40 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah, but you have to either run it in a debugger or insert some SOP's into Liferay code
09:41 <@jhf:#liferay> AFAIK there is no debug statements in this area, so no way to just turn on debugging to find it.
09:41 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> :-)
09:42 <@jhf:#liferay> which images did you change? are you sure you changed the right (runtime) images?
09:48 < jardineworks:#liferay> nicolas_FR, there is an omniadmin setting for the portal-ext file
09:49 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> jardineworks: sorry what is it related to ? Got disconnected
09:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> nicolas_FR, logging in when sso is enabled
09:52 < jardineworks:#liferay> I think that is the only way, unless you have an admin account on the SSO end that matches the admin account in LR (obviously)
09:54 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> jardineworks: ho.. but it was not my question :p
09:55 < jardineworks:#liferay> haha
09:55 < jardineworks:#liferay> oops
09:55 < jardineworks:#liferay> that was for kim_  I guess :)
09:56 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> jfh, as they said in that is looked for the images with grayscale colorspace and changed those to RGB colorspace
09:57 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> i am guessing i must have missed some
10:08 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey jhf do you use the commercial version of intellij or the personal?
10:14 <@jhf:#liferay> jardineworks: commercial
10:15 <@jhf:#liferay> also, not pirated :)
10:18 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, I'm thinking of making the change. Eclipse Kepler crashes on me more than a few times a day.
10:18 < jardineworks:#liferay> its starting to get on my nerves.
10:20 <@jhf:#liferay> welp
10:20 <@jhf:#liferay> I prefer it, but it's up to you! I find it is faster and less crashy
10:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> less crashy is what I am after for sure
10:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> and it looks like it supprts JRebel which is also a requirement
10:21 <@jhf:#liferay> yup it does (but I don't ever use jrebel)
10:22 <@jhf:#liferay> eclipse (well.. Liferay IDE 2) has freemarker debugging though
10:22 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I personally enjoyed the maven integration most after I switched.
10:22 <@jhf:#liferay> so that's cool. but only works for free marker themes
10:22 < jardineworks:#liferay> jrebel is awesome ...
10:22 < jardineworks:#liferay> it has saved me hundreds of hours.
10:23 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> And IntelliJ somehow feels more reliable. Eclipse always has this "pieced together" style to me.
10:23 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah. it's easy for me to click the wrong thing and tons of windows disappear/collapse/get un-pinned and I have no idea how to get it back
10:23 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> And of course you can complain to somebody if something is broken. Huge benefit. ;)
10:23 <@jhf:#liferay> prlly just cause I fire up eclipse for demos, and that's about it
10:27 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, the liferay plugins are available for intellij too though right?
10:28 <@jhf:#liferay> nope
10:28 <@jhf:#liferay> you mean the plugins that turn Eclipse into Liferay IDE?
10:30 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> anyone got knowledge about liferay 5.2.3 custom 404 error page ? We have one working on a test server (tomcat) but it's not working on our production server (apache+tomcat). Any idea ?
10:31 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, yeah... so you have "liferay context" kinda thing
10:33 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah.. nope, you get none of that in intellij
10:33 <@jhf:#liferay> still waiting for someone to write a plugin or two for intellij :)
10:33 <@jhf:#liferay> for like the last 5 years
10:37 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, intellij is OSGi compliant right?
10:37 < jardineworks:#liferay> I thought most of the plugins you could dump in eclipse you could dump into intellij
10:40 <@jhf:#liferay> jardineworks: that I do not know, but I don't think intellij is osgi compliant (and even if it was - I seriously doubt it's API compatible with eclipse plugins)
10:41 < jardineworks:#liferay> hmm -- that might be a deal breaker for me. I use the eclipse plugins extensively.
10:41 < jardineworks:#liferay> is Liferay IDE 2 out?
10:41 <@jhf:#liferay> yep, it is! are you not subscribed (rss) to liferay.com/community/releases ?
10:41 <@jhf:#liferay> wtf
10:42 <@jhf:#liferay> :)
10:42 < jardineworks:#liferay> lol
10:42 < jardineworks:#liferay> shamefully I am not ... but I will be in a few moments :D
10:43 <@jhf:#liferay> the link is at the bottom of that page
10:48 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I thought RSS is dead?
10:49 <@jhf:#liferay> it's still walking around aimlessly with its arms up, moaning, and spewing blood on passers-by
10:52 <@jhf:#liferay> opinions vary on its deadness
10:53 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Maybe it's just undead.
10:53 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I don't have any RSS subscriptions any more. I basically get my information via G+ now, to be honest.
10:55 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> bijoo_:  bijoo_ ! I waited sooooo long for you today ;)
11:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> does anyone know how to display an image (for an item) in a search result?
11:05 <@jhf:#liferay> jardineworks: do you get back a handle to an asset? if so you could use its asset renderer to get a 'displayURL' and possibly show that in a popup or div.
11:17 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> we have a bad note on "minify css". Is there anything to do to get minify css to work in production in liferay 5.2.3 ?
11:27 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> is theme.css.fast.load=true the default setting ?
11:28 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> because we don't have it in our portal-ext.properties file, and it seems we're loading all the css from themes instead of the compressed one...
11:33 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> anyone ?
11:36 < bijoo_:#liferay> nicolas_FR: hey my bad, I know you're in France. I'm back.
11:37 < bijoo_:#liferay> nicolas_FR: Easiest way to check is as such: Login as administrative user. Go to Control Panel -> Server Administration -> Properties
11:37 < bijoo_:#liferay> nicolas_FR: look for the property theme.css.fast.load
11:38 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> hey bijoo_ :) found it
11:39 < bijoo_:#liferay> nicolas_FR: so was it turned off there or is it on?
11:39 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> it was not present in the portal-ext file
11:40 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> I thought it was true by default but just read it was false
11:42 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> bijoo_: so ... we have a problem with our 404 custom page in production. It's working on our test server, but not on prod. As a reminder, we're on L5.2.3, test server is pure tomcat, and prod server uses apache + tomcat
11:53 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> bijoo: we now have theme.css.fast.load to true, but, our minifyCSS note is still bad (like 5/10)
11:53 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> any way to optimise css minify / compression ?
12:08 < bijoo_:#liferay> nicolas_FR: yes, I'll follow up with you in a sec. I'm in middle of something else right now.
12:26 < bijoo_:#liferay> nicolas_FR: https://t.seebgroup.com/nicolas_FR-web-page-test-20140116
12:26 < bijoo_:#liferay> The page size is 1MB my friend.
12:27 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> I know
12:29 < bijoo_:#liferay> nicolas_FR: "time spent pre content type" images: 64.58%!! , script 21.29%, CSS 11.63%, HTML 2.5%
12:29 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> bijoo_: I don't know why all css files are loaded, I though only one should be
12:29 < bijoo_:#liferay> nicolas_FR: I'd say you should focus on images
12:29 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> well.. fact is we use a lot of images... :)
12:29 < bijoo_:#liferay> nicolas_FR: seriously, don't worry css
12:30 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> I'm not, but GTMetrix is, and our guys from marketing - want - gtmetrix to give us a good note, as it uses Page speed (google) and they want a good SEO
12:31 < bijoo_:#liferay> nicolas_FR: i can think for only one css: why have navigation, base, layout, application, etc. css load separately
12:31 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> fact is, if you look at http://gtmetrix.com/reports/www.interiale.fr/It3M6uEb, we have bad notes for minify css and enable gzip compression
12:31 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> and we don't know why
12:31 < bijoo_:#liferay> nicolas_FR: liferay combines those so should be just one file
12:31 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> bijoo_: I know it should be, but it isn't, and I don't know why
12:32 < bijoo_:#liferay> nicolas_FR: it's because of the theme, something's wrong there.
12:32 < bijoo_:#liferay> nicolas_FR: post a forum post with details, I'll help.
12:32 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> a forum post where exactly ?
12:33 < bijoo_:#liferay> nicolas_FR: in Custom Theme Development, here: http://www.liferay.com/community/forums/-/message_boards/category/239389
