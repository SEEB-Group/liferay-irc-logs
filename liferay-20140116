02:21 < dm-o:#liferay> good morning everyone
02:23 < dm-o:#liferay> i got a hopefully simple question. Is it possible to use life ray as a system for quality management? we`ve got hundreds of documents in revisions and want an automated process for release of new documents or sending em back for changes to the author by a user.
02:26 < satheesh:#liferay> dm-o: Yeah. Its possible
02:27 < dm-o:#liferay> hi satheesh thank you for your answer. Is it a "build-in" feature of the community edition? I did not found any examples via google.
02:28 < dm-o:#liferay> we need it for document control with company header on each document and foot print etc.
02:30 < satheesh:#liferay> 1. Document Versioning
02:30 < satheesh:#liferay> 2. Single Approver workflow
02:31 < satheesh:#liferay> Are  built-in functionality for CE
02:32 < satheesh:#liferay> "built-in" is also called as out-of-the-box functionality
02:47 < dm-o:#liferay> thank you for the information satheesh i will give it a try as a company intranet now
02:49 < dm-o:#liferay> bye bye for now

08:40 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> hi there
08:50 < kim_:#liferay> Ho can i login as admin when SSO is enabled?
08:58 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> has anyone seen this error? "java.awt.image.RasterFormatException: Incorrect scanline stride: 4"
09:03 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> not here
09:35 <@jhf:#liferay> avinashrbhat: yep thats a known issue
09:35 <@jhf:#liferay> it's due to a change in one of the JDK runtime libraries that Liferay was not expecting :)
09:37 <@jhf:#liferay> see https://issues.liferay.com/browse/LPS-37433 for workarounds and details
09:37 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> jhf, hmm, saw the issue myself, i have changed all the grayscale images to RGB, still no changes
09:37 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> ya that one itself
