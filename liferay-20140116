01:29 < bijoo_:#liferay> \q
02:21 < dm-o:#liferay> good morning everyone
02:23 < dm-o:#liferay> i got a hopefully simple question. Is it possible to use life ray as a system for quality management? we`ve got hundreds of documents in revisions and want an automated process for release of new documents or sending em back for changes to the author by a user.
02:26 < satheesh:#liferay> dm-o: Yeah. Its possible
02:27 < dm-o:#liferay> hi satheesh thank you for your answer. Is it a "build-in" feature of the community edition? I did not found any examples via google.
02:28 < dm-o:#liferay> we need it for document control with company header on each document and foot print etc.
02:30 < satheesh:#liferay> 1. Document Versioning
02:30 < satheesh:#liferay> 2. Single Approver workflow
02:31 < satheesh:#liferay> Are  built-in functionality for CE
02:32 < satheesh:#liferay> "built-in" is also called as out-of-the-box functionality
02:47 < dm-o:#liferay> thank you for the information satheesh i will give it a try as a company intranet now
02:49 < dm-o:#liferay> bye bye for now
02:49 < dm-o:#liferay> :away
02:49 < dm-o:#liferay> :help
03:12 < satheesh:#liferay> cool
03:48 < quercus:#liferay> is just me or do you get proxy error also from here: https://repository.liferay.com/nexus/content/groups/liferay-ce/com/liferay/portal/portal-client/6.2.0-ga1/portal-client-6.2.0-ga1.pom ?
04:10 < satheesh:#liferay> quercus: I'm getting the proxy error
04:10 < satheesh:#liferay> https://repository.liferay.com/nexus/content/groups/liferay-ce/com/liferay/portal/portal-client/6.2.0-ga1/
04:24 < quercus:#liferay> ok, thanks for confirming this.
04:25 < satheesh:#liferay> welcome
08:40 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> hi there
08:50 < kim_:#liferay> Ho can i login as admin when SSO is enabled?
08:58 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> has anyone seen this error? "java.awt.image.RasterFormatException: Incorrect scanline stride: 4"
09:03 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> not here
09:35 <@jhf:#liferay> avinashrbhat: yep thats a known issue
09:35 <@jhf:#liferay> it's due to a change in one of the JDK runtime libraries that Liferay was not expecting :)
09:37 <@jhf:#liferay> see https://issues.liferay.com/browse/LPS-37433 for workarounds and details
09:37 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> jhf, hmm, saw the issue myself, i have changed all the grayscale images to RGB, still no changes
09:37 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> ya that one itself
09:40 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> jhf, is there any way to find the image that causes this?
09:40 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah, but you have to either run it in a debugger or insert some SOP's into Liferay code
09:41 <@jhf:#liferay> AFAIK there is no debug statements in this area, so no way to just turn on debugging to find it.
09:41 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> :-)
09:42 <@jhf:#liferay> which images did you change? are you sure you changed the right (runtime) images?
09:48 < jardineworks:#liferay> nicolas_FR, there is an omniadmin setting for the portal-ext file
09:49 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> jardineworks: sorry what is it related to ? Got disconnected
09:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> nicolas_FR, logging in when sso is enabled
09:52 < jardineworks:#liferay> I think that is the only way, unless you have an admin account on the SSO end that matches the admin account in LR (obviously)
09:54 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> jardineworks: ho.. but it was not my question :p
09:55 < jardineworks:#liferay> haha
09:55 < jardineworks:#liferay> oops
09:55 < jardineworks:#liferay> that was for kim_  I guess :)
09:56 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> jfh, as they said in that is looked for the images with grayscale colorspace and changed those to RGB colorspace
09:57 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> i am guessing i must have missed some
10:08 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey jhf do you use the commercial version of intellij or the personal?
10:14 <@jhf:#liferay> jardineworks: commercial
10:15 <@jhf:#liferay> also, not pirated :)
10:18 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, I'm thinking of making the change. Eclipse Kepler crashes on me more than a few times a day.
10:18 < jardineworks:#liferay> its starting to get on my nerves.
10:20 <@jhf:#liferay> welp
10:20 <@jhf:#liferay> I prefer it, but it's up to you! I find it is faster and less crashy
10:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> less crashy is what I am after for sure
10:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> and it looks like it supprts JRebel which is also a requirement
10:21 <@jhf:#liferay> yup it does (but I don't ever use jrebel)
10:22 <@jhf:#liferay> eclipse (well.. Liferay IDE 2) has freemarker debugging though
10:22 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I personally enjoyed the maven integration most after I switched.
10:22 <@jhf:#liferay> so that's cool. but only works for free marker themes
10:22 < jardineworks:#liferay> jrebel is awesome ...
10:22 < jardineworks:#liferay> it has saved me hundreds of hours.
10:23 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> And IntelliJ somehow feels more reliable. Eclipse always has this "pieced together" style to me.
10:23 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah. it's easy for me to click the wrong thing and tons of windows disappear/collapse/get un-pinned and I have no idea how to get it back
10:23 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> And of course you can complain to somebody if something is broken. Huge benefit. ;)
10:23 <@jhf:#liferay> prlly just cause I fire up eclipse for demos, and that's about it
10:27 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, the liferay plugins are available for intellij too though right?
10:28 <@jhf:#liferay> nope
10:28 <@jhf:#liferay> you mean the plugins that turn Eclipse into Liferay IDE?
10:30 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> anyone got knowledge about liferay 5.2.3 custom 404 error page ? We have one working on a test server (tomcat) but it's not working on our production server (apache+tomcat). Any idea ?
10:31 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, yeah... so you have "liferay context" kinda thing
10:33 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah.. nope, you get none of that in intellij
10:33 <@jhf:#liferay> still waiting for someone to write a plugin or two for intellij :)
10:33 <@jhf:#liferay> for like the last 5 years
10:37 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, intellij is OSGi compliant right?
10:37 < jardineworks:#liferay> I thought most of the plugins you could dump in eclipse you could dump into intellij
10:40 <@jhf:#liferay> jardineworks: that I do not know, but I don't think intellij is osgi compliant (and even if it was - I seriously doubt it's API compatible with eclipse plugins)
10:41 < jardineworks:#liferay> hmm -- that might be a deal breaker for me. I use the eclipse plugins extensively.
10:41 < jardineworks:#liferay> is Liferay IDE 2 out?
10:41 <@jhf:#liferay> yep, it is! are you not subscribed (rss) to liferay.com/community/releases ?
10:41 <@jhf:#liferay> wtf
10:42 <@jhf:#liferay> :)
10:42 < jardineworks:#liferay> lol
10:42 < jardineworks:#liferay> shamefully I am not ... but I will be in a few moments :D
10:43 <@jhf:#liferay> the link is at the bottom of that page
10:48 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I thought RSS is dead?
10:49 <@jhf:#liferay> it's still walking around aimlessly with its arms up, moaning, and spewing blood on passers-by
10:52 <@jhf:#liferay> opinions vary on its deadness
10:53 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Maybe it's just undead.
10:53 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I don't have any RSS subscriptions any more. I basically get my information via G+ now, to be honest.
10:55 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> bijoo_:  bijoo_ ! I waited sooooo long for you today ;)
11:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> does anyone know how to display an image (for an item) in a search result?
11:05 <@jhf:#liferay> jardineworks: do you get back a handle to an asset? if so you could use its asset renderer to get a 'displayURL' and possibly show that in a popup or div.
11:17 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> we have a bad note on "minify css". Is there anything to do to get minify css to work in production in liferay 5.2.3 ?
11:27 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> is theme.css.fast.load=true the default setting ?
11:28 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> because we don't have it in our portal-ext.properties file, and it seems we're loading all the css from themes instead of the compressed one...
11:33 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> anyone ?
11:36 < bijoo_:#liferay> nicolas_FR: hey my bad, I know you're in France. I'm back.
11:37 < bijoo_:#liferay> nicolas_FR: Easiest way to check is as such: Login as administrative user. Go to Control Panel -> Server Administration -> Properties
11:37 < bijoo_:#liferay> nicolas_FR: look for the property theme.css.fast.load
11:38 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> hey bijoo_ :) found it
11:39 < bijoo_:#liferay> nicolas_FR: so was it turned off there or is it on?
11:39 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> it was not present in the portal-ext file
11:40 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> I thought it was true by default but just read it was false
11:42 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> bijoo_: so ... we have a problem with our 404 custom page in production. It's working on our test server, but not on prod. As a reminder, we're on L5.2.3, test server is pure tomcat, and prod server uses apache + tomcat
11:53 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> bijoo: we now have theme.css.fast.load to true, but, our minifyCSS note is still bad (like 5/10)
11:53 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> any way to optimise css minify / compression ?
12:08 < bijoo_:#liferay> nicolas_FR: yes, I'll follow up with you in a sec. I'm in middle of something else right now.
12:26 < bijoo_:#liferay> nicolas_FR: https://t.seebgroup.com/nicolas_FR-web-page-test-20140116
12:26 < bijoo_:#liferay> The page size is 1MB my friend.
12:27 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> I know
12:29 < bijoo_:#liferay> nicolas_FR: "time spent pre content type" images: 64.58%!! , script 21.29%, CSS 11.63%, HTML 2.5%
12:29 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> bijoo_: I don't know why all css files are loaded, I though only one should be
12:29 < bijoo_:#liferay> nicolas_FR: I'd say you should focus on images
12:29 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> well.. fact is we use a lot of images... :)
12:29 < bijoo_:#liferay> nicolas_FR: seriously, don't worry css
12:30 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> I'm not, but GTMetrix is, and our guys from marketing - want - gtmetrix to give us a good note, as it uses Page speed (google) and they want a good SEO
12:31 < bijoo_:#liferay> nicolas_FR: i can think for only one css: why have navigation, base, layout, application, etc. css load separately
12:31 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> fact is, if you look at http://gtmetrix.com/reports/www.interiale.fr/It3M6uEb, we have bad notes for minify css and enable gzip compression
12:31 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> and we don't know why
12:31 < bijoo_:#liferay> nicolas_FR: liferay combines those so should be just one file
12:31 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> bijoo_: I know it should be, but it isn't, and I don't know why
12:32 < bijoo_:#liferay> nicolas_FR: it's because of the theme, something's wrong there.
12:32 < bijoo_:#liferay> nicolas_FR: post a forum post with details, I'll help.
12:32 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> a forum post where exactly ?
12:33 < bijoo_:#liferay> nicolas_FR: in Custom Theme Development, here: http://www.liferay.com/community/forums/-/message_boards/category/239389
12:34 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> btw, we had no theme.css.fast.load in configuration before our restart
12:34 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> now, we got it, BUT I did not clear work/ and temp/ folders. Might it be that ?
12:35 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> liferay still working with old temp/ work/ files, and thus not using the theme.css.fast.load= true parameter
12:35 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> (well I mean the css minified)
12:36 < bijoo_:#liferay> nicolas_FR: I doubt it is, need to review the theme. Check the main.css file in the theme. All css should be imported through that file. Rebuild the theme with the new portal settings in place now. Clearing temp/* and work/* wont hurt; but redeploy after checking the theme?
12:37 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> theme seems good. all css are @import in main.css file
12:38 < bijoo_:#liferay> nicolas_FR: hmm, good point there. May want to clear cache. That's the best idea without details.
12:38 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> bijoo_: browser cache ? Or temp/work folders ?
12:39 < bijoo_:#liferay> nicolas_FR: temp/work folders; then restart the portal.
12:41 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> cleared, restarting
12:47 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> nothing changed =(
12:50 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> well I need to go, I'll post something tomorrow on the forums. Thanks for help
12:51 < bijoo_:#liferay> nicolas_FR: Okay my friend. I'll check. Have a good night.
13:39 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf,   do have an asset renderer (I think). I am overriding the JSPs for the federated serach portlet. I am using the JSP sciptlet for a search container row and then just dumping the search container and outputting the valeus in my own foreach loop.
13:40 < jardineworks:#liferay> the template for each item is your typical floating image on the left, title (linked to full view) synopsis and tags. The OOTB has it all, except the image
13:47 <@jhf:#liferay> hmm
13:47 <@jhf:#liferay> but what if the search result isn't an image?
13:47 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, I think we have our wires crossed. I want to display a thumbnail of an image that is already on the piece of content (if specified)
13:48 < jardineworks:#liferay> not necessarily an "image" piece of conetnt
13:48 <@jhf:#liferay> you are overriding the search portlet though, which may return results that aren't images OR web content. what if it's a bookmark or a forum post?
13:49 < jardineworks:#liferay> neither or those exist on my site -- but I understand the point. I am hoping to put a conditional that will filter out any results that aren't of type X
13:50 < jardineworks:#liferay> If I don't make them searcheable to begin with for example right?
13:50 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah that's one way. you can also do something with facet definition I think.
13:50 < jardineworks:#liferay> so if I have content type A, B, C, D .... and I only want A and B in my results, I can just make C and D "not searcheable right?
13:51 <@jhf:#liferay> I... think so..
13:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> right
13:51 <@jhf:#liferay> :)
13:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> you can specify JounralArticle as a type
13:51 <@jhf:#liferay> so what kind of asset will you get? just web content?
13:51 <@jhf:#liferay> ok. so web content articles have this one well-defined field called "small image"
13:51 <@jhf:#liferay> could you use that?
13:51 <@jhf:#liferay> then it might be even easier to get the image you're seeking
13:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> yeah -- so what we are doing is surfacing web content store in LR (of particular structure types). Then I have two OpenSeachImpl for searches to those REST services.
13:52 < jardineworks:#liferay> then I am doing all sorts of black magic to create tabbed results :)
13:52 < jardineworks:#liferay> small image works
13:52 < jardineworks:#liferay> how do you get it from the asset rendere though?
13:53 <@jhf:#liferay> one sec.. con call dang it
13:53 <@jhf:#liferay> can't get it from asset renderer
13:53 <@jhf:#liferay> you'd need a handle to the article object
13:53 <@jhf:#liferay> JournalArticle
13:53 <@jhf:#liferay> then there should be some kind of getSmallImage() or something easy
13:53 < jardineworks:#liferay> right ... so I have ti user the *LocalServiceUtil to get the whole article.
13:53 <@jhf:#liferay> not sure
13:53 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah.
13:53 <@jhf:#liferay> the id should be in the "Hit"
13:53 < jardineworks:#liferay> does asset renderer provide me with the article id?
13:54 <@jhf:#liferay> the search result should have something in it
13:54 <@jhf:#liferay> like an id
13:54 < jardineworks:#liferay> rootEntryClassPK=[240616],
13:54 < jardineworks:#liferay> ?
13:54 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah... probably :)
13:55 < jardineworks:#liferay> there also appears to be entryClassPK with the same value
13:58 < jardineworks:#liferay> hah -- even better -- localized_title_en_US=[frozen foods], articleId=[240614]
13:58 < jardineworks:#liferay> :)
15:56 < dawn:#liferay> jhf: a quick question. I am trying to import a LAR file, but unable due to this error. http://postimg.org/gallery/1k2qf5lw/051ec570/. I opened up the LAR and was able to find all three categories mentioned. Not sure what is causing this error.
15:58 <@jhf:#liferay> ok i'll give it a go.
15:59 < dawn:#liferay> jhf: thank you
16:05 <@jhf:#liferay> ok so I exported a site's public pages, then created a blank site and tried to import and got the same error.
16:05 <@jhf:#liferay> is that about what you're trying to do?
16:11 < dawn:#liferay> jhf: that is exactly what I did
16:12 <@jhf:#liferay> looking into it.. in the meantime, after creating the blank site, but BEFORE import, could you first re-create those missing categories (under the same vocabularies)? that might be one workaround.
16:13 < dawn:#liferay> jhf:let me try that. will update you
16:15 < dawn:#liferay> jhf: No luck. it still complains about those artifacts
16:21 <@jhf:#liferay> hmm
16:21 <@jhf:#liferay> I tried it again, and it worked
16:21 <@jhf:#liferay> can you try again?
16:21 <@jhf:#liferay> just try to re-import
16:22 <@jhf:#liferay> (I had to manually create the vocabularies and categories first)
16:24 < dawn:#liferay> jhf: I did try multiple times before and after creating them. You must be very lucky to get it to work on second attempt. any other settings to be done?
17:19 <@jhf:#liferay> ok dawn I think the problem is that exporting of categories doesn't export them properly (they are in the LAR file but also marked as 'missing' in the manifest.xml)
17:20 <@jhf:#liferay> I think it was never completed - see https://issues.liferay.com/browse/LPS-42517  but if you re-create the same exact vocab/categories in the new site, it should work (it worked for me) - they must be identical in name.
17:20 <@jhf:#liferay> and hierarchy.
17:20 <@jhf:#liferay> I will file a bug on your behalf though. one sec.
17:24 < dawn:#liferay> jhf: In my case I couldn't make it work by creating those missing categories in new site. Do you think i can get away by tweaking the manifest file?
17:24 <@jhf:#liferay> you can try to remove that one missing reference from manifest.xml look for lines beginning with <missing-reference class-name="com.liferay.portlet.asset.model.AssetCategory"
17:25 <@jhf:#liferay> well, remove all of them (that start with the above)
17:28 < dawn:#liferay> jhf: yes I tried by removing missing entries in manifest and it worked
17:30 <@jhf:#liferay> ok dawn I filed https://issues.liferay.com/browse/LPS-43567
17:30 <@jhf:#liferay> feel free to add yourself as a watcher, and/or comment on the ticket
17:32 < dawn:#liferay> jhf: thank you
17:33 <@jhf:#liferay> no worries.. thanks for the report!1
