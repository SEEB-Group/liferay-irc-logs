11:21 < winem_:#liferay> hi together. is there anyone who runs liferay 6.2 in jboss wildfly without any issue?
11:23 < winem_:#liferay> we expirienced several issues due to the new http implementation called undertow e.g. some of them are fixed,  but not yet all of them
11:41 < winem_:#liferay> one of the last remaining issues is the cookie handling. new users are stuck in an infinite loop on the "Terms of Use"-Page
