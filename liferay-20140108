09:17 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Ahoy.
09:18 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> This rendering issue really irks me.
09:18 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> We actually restarted the boxes now and still the article is rendered with the wrong template.
09:18 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> One instance is rendering it correctly, the other four don't. They all use the same database.
09:18 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I don't understand how this can even happen...
09:29 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, Do you have your environment setup to let you step through the portal code?
09:30 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Nope. Never managed it.
09:31 < jardineworks:#liferay> shoot. I think that might be your best bet as a next step to be honest. I am assuming that you have turned the logging up as well to see what Liferay is spitting out?
09:33 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I'm currently dumping the DB to try and reconstruct the problem locally.
09:33 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Most likely I will not be able to reproduce the issue. At least that's usually what happens
09:34 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, do you have access to the logs?
09:34 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Sadly, no.
09:34 < jardineworks:#liferay> because if you do then you can turn the logging up in the control panel ... ther eare probably a few classes specific to Journal Articles and Templates that you could enable ALL as a setting and then see what is reported
09:34 < jardineworks:#liferay> jesus
09:35 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Yes...it's a lot of fun.
09:35 < jardineworks:#liferay> how does your team expect you to solve an issue without access to information? magic?
09:35 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> We'll be live with our new setup by the end of the month hopefully.
09:35 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Team? What team?
09:36 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> It's only me basically.
09:40 < jardineworks:#liferay> there must be someone else who is not letting you see the logs  :)
09:41 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Yes...I told him I want to have access and he buried me in a bunch of forms and organisational hoops I would have to jump through.
09:41 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Hosting is done by some service provider.
09:41 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> It's quite ridiculous.

09:43 < jardineworks:#liferay> you can't even request a log dump?
09:43 < jardineworks:#liferay> like even if they won't give you real time access... can they not send you a file?
09:43 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I could...but usually they ignore my mails for several days and then I have to nudge my superior to hit them over the head.
09:46 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> This is really creepy. Liferay is outright lying to me.
09:47 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I see it renders wrong...but it shows me the right template.
09:53 < bjornjohansson:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur: cache? ;)
09:53 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Can't be. I just started the system.
09:53 < bjornjohansson:#liferay> Okey
09:56 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur,  When you look at the content item that is rendering incorrectly... how many template options are there?
09:56 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> The usual four.
09:57 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> This is getting out of hand.
09:57 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> We have a couple of modules. A couple for TV spots, a couple for image teasers etc.
09:57 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> All of them exist in three flavors.
09:57 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Small, Medium and Large.
09:58 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> When I add a medium Image teaser, it's rendered with the Medium Image Teaser template.
09:58 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> *When I add a medium Image teaser, it's rendered with the Medium TV Teaser template.
09:58 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> And when I use a small image teaser, it's rendered with the small TV teaser template.
09:58 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> What the...?!
