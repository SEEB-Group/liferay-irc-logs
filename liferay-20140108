09:17 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Ahoy.
09:18 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> This rendering issue really irks me.
09:18 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> We actually restarted the boxes now and still the article is rendered with the wrong template.
09:18 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> One instance is rendering it correctly, the other four don't. They all use the same database.
09:18 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I don't understand how this can even happen...
09:29 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, Do you have your environment setup to let you step through the portal code?
09:30 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Nope. Never managed it.
09:31 < jardineworks:#liferay> shoot. I think that might be your best bet as a next step to be honest. I am assuming that you have turned the logging up as well to see what Liferay is spitting out?
09:33 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I'm currently dumping the DB to try and reconstruct the problem locally.
09:33 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Most likely I will not be able to reproduce the issue. At least that's usually what happens
