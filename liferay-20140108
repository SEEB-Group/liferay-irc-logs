09:17 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Ahoy.
09:18 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> This rendering issue really irks me.
09:18 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> We actually restarted the boxes now and still the article is rendered with the wrong template.
09:18 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> One instance is rendering it correctly, the other four don't. They all use the same database.
09:18 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I don't understand how this can even happen...
09:29 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, Do you have your environment setup to let you step through the portal code?
09:30 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Nope. Never managed it.
09:31 < jardineworks:#liferay> shoot. I think that might be your best bet as a next step to be honest. I am assuming that you have turned the logging up as well to see what Liferay is spitting out?
09:33 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I'm currently dumping the DB to try and reconstruct the problem locally.
09:33 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Most likely I will not be able to reproduce the issue. At least that's usually what happens
09:34 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, do you have access to the logs?
09:34 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Sadly, no.
09:34 < jardineworks:#liferay> because if you do then you can turn the logging up in the control panel ... ther eare probably a few classes specific to Journal Articles and Templates that you could enable ALL as a setting and then see what is reported
09:34 < jardineworks:#liferay> jesus
09:35 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Yes...it's a lot of fun.
09:35 < jardineworks:#liferay> how does your team expect you to solve an issue without access to information? magic?
09:35 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> We'll be live with our new setup by the end of the month hopefully.
09:35 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Team? What team?
09:36 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> It's only me basically.
09:40 < jardineworks:#liferay> there must be someone else who is not letting you see the logs  :)
09:41 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Yes...I told him I want to have access and he buried me in a bunch of forms and organisational hoops I would have to jump through.
09:41 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Hosting is done by some service provider.
09:41 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> It's quite ridiculous.

09:43 < jardineworks:#liferay> you can't even request a log dump?
09:43 < jardineworks:#liferay> like even if they won't give you real time access... can they not send you a file?
09:43 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I could...but usually they ignore my mails for several days and then I have to nudge my superior to hit them over the head.
09:46 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> This is really creepy. Liferay is outright lying to me.
09:47 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I see it renders wrong...but it shows me the right template.
09:53 < bjornjohansson:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur: cache? ;)
09:53 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Can't be. I just started the system.
09:53 < bjornjohansson:#liferay> Okey
09:56 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur,  When you look at the content item that is rendering incorrectly... how many template options are there?
09:56 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> The usual four.
09:57 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> This is getting out of hand.
09:57 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> We have a couple of modules. A couple for TV spots, a couple for image teasers etc.
09:57 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> All of them exist in three flavors.
09:57 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Small, Medium and Large.
09:58 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> When I add a medium Image teaser, it's rendered with the Medium Image Teaser template.
09:58 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> *When I add a medium Image teaser, it's rendered with the Medium TV Teaser template.
09:58 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> And when I use a small image teaser, it's rendered with the small TV teaser template.
09:58 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> What the...?!
09:59 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> There is NO connection between these. Liferay can't even know this....
10:07 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, grasping here... but did you try diffing the template contents (from the editor) ? .. I once had made the mistake of copying and pasting into the wrong one which resulted in the same thing.
10:08 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> There is a <li class="video"> in there. And the other template has a <li class="row"> instead
10:08 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> It's very easy to distinguish.
10:08 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> And the rendered output definitely doesn't correspond to the template I'm shown when I click "Edit Template".
10:10 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I wonder what happens when I remove the template that is used incorrectly.
10:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> I was going to ask that -- if you are allowed to
10:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> remove it, and then add it back?
10:11 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> On my box I can do whatever I want. Here I'm god...it's a small world, but it's MINE! ;)
10:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> or even assign the cotnent item to a new template, publish, and then switch it to the correct one publish
10:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> you are able to reproduce on your box?
10:11 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Yes.
10:11 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> The thing I described above is something I noticed on my local box just now.
10:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> oh! well then turn the logging up and setup the portal source with a debugger man! :)
10:11 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I doubt I'll get this up and running. Never worked before.
10:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> well, if you have the site running on your local you can at least turn the logging level up
10:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> do you know where to get to it in the control panel?
10:13 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Yes.
10:13 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> But which topics should I change?
10:13 < jardineworks:#liferay> I would search for anything with Journal or Template
10:13 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Sounds reasonable.
10:13 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> :D
10:13 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> The more the merrier.
10:14 < jardineworks:#liferay> Template is nothing... but there is a JournalUtil; and JournalContentUtil..
10:14 < jardineworks:#liferay> you could maybe add a category as well
10:15 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Hm. The output I get for that is totally useless to me.
10:15 < jardineworks:#liferay> JournalContentUtil.getDisplay() is the method I used last night to apply a template to a content item
10:16 < jardineworks:#liferay> JournalArticleDisplay jad = JournalContentUtil.getDisplay( themeDisplay.getScopeGroupId(), ja.getArticleId(), PortletMode.VIEW.toString(), themeDisplay.getLanguageId(), themeDisplay );
10:19 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> No Logger in there.
10:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> you're looking at the source?
10:20 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> And it's mere an adapter for JournalContent anyway.
10:20 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> *merely
10:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> a lot of logging is done using AOP ... you won't always find a "log.debug" or whatever in the source.
10:20 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> And JournalContent is only an interface and sadly the JavaDoc doesn't say which classes implement it.
10:27 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, it would be implemented (likely) by JournalContentImpl  which I would guess then becomes a base class for content.
10:29 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Interesting. When I modify the template that is used instead of the correct one, nothing happens.
