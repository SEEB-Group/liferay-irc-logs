05:33 < rrapozo:#liferay> Hello everyone someone can help me in a progress bar gor a upload file in liferay 6.1? :D
07:05 < rrapozo:#liferay> Hello everyone someone can help me in a progress bar gor a upload file in liferay 6.1? :D
09:17 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Ahoy.
09:18 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> This rendering issue really irks me.
09:18 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> We actually restarted the boxes now and still the article is rendered with the wrong template.
09:18 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> One instance is rendering it correctly, the other four don't. They all use the same database.
09:18 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I don't understand how this can even happen...
09:29 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, Do you have your environment setup to let you step through the portal code?
09:30 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Nope. Never managed it.
09:31 < jardineworks:#liferay> shoot. I think that might be your best bet as a next step to be honest. I am assuming that you have turned the logging up as well to see what Liferay is spitting out?
09:33 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I'm currently dumping the DB to try and reconstruct the problem locally.
09:33 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Most likely I will not be able to reproduce the issue. At least that's usually what happens
09:34 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, do you have access to the logs?
09:34 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Sadly, no.
09:34 < jardineworks:#liferay> because if you do then you can turn the logging up in the control panel ... ther eare probably a few classes specific to Journal Articles and Templates that you could enable ALL as a setting and then see what is reported
09:34 < jardineworks:#liferay> jesus
09:35 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Yes...it's a lot of fun.
09:35 < jardineworks:#liferay> how does your team expect you to solve an issue without access to information? magic?
09:35 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> We'll be live with our new setup by the end of the month hopefully.
09:35 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Team? What team?
09:36 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> It's only me basically.
09:40 < jardineworks:#liferay> there must be someone else who is not letting you see the logs  :)
09:41 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Yes...I told him I want to have access and he buried me in a bunch of forms and organisational hoops I would have to jump through.
09:41 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Hosting is done by some service provider.
09:41 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> It's quite ridiculous.
09:42 -!- mode/#liferay [+o rotty3000] by ChanServ
09:43 < jardineworks:#liferay> you can't even request a log dump?
09:43 < jardineworks:#liferay> like even if they won't give you real time access... can they not send you a file?
09:43 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I could...but usually they ignore my mails for several days and then I have to nudge my superior to hit them over the head.
09:46 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> This is really creepy. Liferay is outright lying to me.
09:47 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I see it renders wrong...but it shows me the right template.
09:53 < bjornjohansson:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur: cache? ;)
09:53 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Can't be. I just started the system.
09:53 < bjornjohansson:#liferay> Okey
09:56 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur,  When you look at the content item that is rendering incorrectly... how many template options are there?
09:56 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> The usual four.
09:57 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> This is getting out of hand.
09:57 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> We have a couple of modules. A couple for TV spots, a couple for image teasers etc.
09:57 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> All of them exist in three flavors.
09:57 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Small, Medium and Large.
09:58 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> When I add a medium Image teaser, it's rendered with the Medium Image Teaser template.
09:58 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> *When I add a medium Image teaser, it's rendered with the Medium TV Teaser template.
09:58 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> And when I use a small image teaser, it's rendered with the small TV teaser template.
09:58 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> What the...?!
09:59 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> There is NO connection between these. Liferay can't even know this....
10:07 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, grasping here... but did you try diffing the template contents (from the editor) ? .. I once had made the mistake of copying and pasting into the wrong one which resulted in the same thing.
10:08 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> There is a <li class="video"> in there. And the other template has a <li class="row"> instead
10:08 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> It's very easy to distinguish.
10:08 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> And the rendered output definitely doesn't correspond to the template I'm shown when I click "Edit Template".
10:10 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I wonder what happens when I remove the template that is used incorrectly.
10:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> I was going to ask that -- if you are allowed to
10:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> remove it, and then add it back?
10:11 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> On my box I can do whatever I want. Here I'm god...it's a small world, but it's MINE! ;)
10:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> or even assign the cotnent item to a new template, publish, and then switch it to the correct one publish
10:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> you are able to reproduce on your box?
10:11 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Yes.
10:11 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> The thing I described above is something I noticed on my local box just now.
10:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> oh! well then turn the logging up and setup the portal source with a debugger man! :)
10:11 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I doubt I'll get this up and running. Never worked before.
10:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> well, if you have the site running on your local you can at least turn the logging level up
10:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> do you know where to get to it in the control panel?
10:13 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Yes.
10:13 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> But which topics should I change?
10:13 < jardineworks:#liferay> I would search for anything with Journal or Template
10:13 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Sounds reasonable.
10:13 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> :D
10:13 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> The more the merrier.
10:14 < jardineworks:#liferay> Template is nothing... but there is a JournalUtil; and JournalContentUtil..
10:14 < jardineworks:#liferay> you could maybe add a category as well
10:15 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Hm. The output I get for that is totally useless to me.
10:15 < jardineworks:#liferay> JournalContentUtil.getDisplay() is the method I used last night to apply a template to a content item
10:16 < jardineworks:#liferay> JournalArticleDisplay jad = JournalContentUtil.getDisplay( themeDisplay.getScopeGroupId(), ja.getArticleId(), PortletMode.VIEW.toString(), themeDisplay.getLanguageId(), themeDisplay );
10:19 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> No Logger in there.
10:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> you're looking at the source?
10:20 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> And it's mere an adapter for JournalContent anyway.
10:20 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> *merely
10:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> a lot of logging is done using AOP ... you won't always find a "log.debug" or whatever in the source.
10:20 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> And JournalContent is only an interface and sadly the JavaDoc doesn't say which classes implement it.
10:27 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, it would be implemented (likely) by JournalContentImpl  which I would guess then becomes a base class for content.
10:29 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Interesting. When I modify the template that is used instead of the correct one, nothing happens.
10:30 < jardineworks:#liferay> that probably requiers some cache clearing and such
10:31 < jardineworks:#liferay> anytime I do anyting in the web content section, my next step is to go to the Serve Administration and clearn VM cache, clear database cache, etc.
10:32 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> That doesn't do anything.
10:32 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I modified both templates now and nothing at all happens.
10:33 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> This feels like quicksand.
10:52 < rrapozo:#liferay>  Hello everyone someone can help me in a progress bar gor a upload file in liferay 6.1? :D
11:13 <@jhf:#liferay> rrapozo: check out https://www.liferay.com/community/wiki/-/wiki/Main/How+to+add+a+progress+bar+to+my+portlet to get started
11:14 <@jhf:#liferay> and some working code (haven't tried it myself) at http://lauraliparulo.altervista.org/liferay-upload-file-portlet-working-example-with-upload-progress-bar/
11:19 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> *lol* By now it looks like Liferay randomly selects some template to render this article.
11:20 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I have half a mind to just build a HTML generator and have the content editors copy & paste the stuff into basic web content instead of using this kind of modular setup. Just to save me the hassle...
11:20 < rrapozo:#liferay> jhf: I tried that one but does not work with me
11:20 < rrapozo:#liferay> :(
11:33 <@jhf:#liferay> (sorry, on conference call) rrapozo so what happens when you try it? any errors?
11:37 < rrapozo:#liferay> no, but the upload bar doesn't work
11:37 <@jhf:#liferay> does the file get uploaded?
11:37 < rrapozo:#liferay> the file is uploaded but the upload bar don't show the progress
11:38 <@jhf:#liferay> ok. and you are trying this in a portlet you have developed?
11:38 < rrapozo:#liferay> yes!!!
11:38 <@jhf:#liferay> I'll give it a go in about 20 minutes and see if I can get it to work. what version of Liferay are you using?
11:39 <@jhf:#liferay> oh sorry you said 6.1 already.
11:39 <@jhf:#liferay> ok i'll give it a go in a bit. still on call.
11:39 < rrapozo:#liferay> 6.1
11:39 < rrapozo:#liferay> thanks a lot jhf
11:39 <@jhf:#liferay> and what app server do you use
11:42 < rrapozo:#liferay> tomcat 7
12:01 < rrapozo:#liferay> sorry I had problems with my noveuau linuz driver
12:01 < rrapozo:#liferay> :)
12:11 <@jhf:#liferay> ok rrapozo I am working on it.

18:23 < dawn:#liferay> hi
18:26 < dawn:#liferay> I am not able to import a LAR that was exported from LR 6.2 GA1 of different instance. The error says missing Document that was refered in Asset publisher. Upon unzipping the LAR and grepping for document Id, i found it is refereeing to Document library package files. Any help is appreciated.
20:10 < bijoo_:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur: hey, are you still having the issues there?
