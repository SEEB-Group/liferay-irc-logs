03:56 < modd_:#liferay> hi topolik. do you have a minute to explain how permissions work in your fsrepo hook? as far as I see, you're creating an expando for RepositoryEntry, saving the path there and adding entries to the repositoryentry table. I would expect the permissions beeing saved in resourcepermission table, but nothing has changed after changing permissions for a file/folder
03:56 < modd_:#liferay> also I'm not getting new entries when accessing new folders, while I see new repositoryentry entries
03:58 < modd_:#liferay> it's also strange, that the classNameId of the expando is 10254 while classname_ tells me, that RepositoryEntry has the id 10154 and 10254 doesn't exist
04:31 < topolik:#liferay> hi modd_
04:31 < topolik:#liferay> it's a magic
04:31 < topolik:#liferay> ;)
04:32 < modd_:#liferay> :P
04:32 < topolik:#liferay> frankly, I don't remember how it works :D I need to look at it
04:33 < topolik:#liferay> but, hmm, it's strange
04:33 < topolik:#liferay> I know I had to use DL FileEntry permissions
04:33 < topolik:#liferay> otherwise there would be no UI to manage them
04:34 < topolik:#liferay> what fsrepo version do you look at?
04:34 < modd_:#liferay> I've downloaded your source
04:34 < modd_:#liferay> and build it by myself
04:35 < modd_:#liferay> so it's the git- master version
04:36 < modd_:#liferay> in LocalFileSystemPermissionsUtil you're using DLFileEntry and DLFolder
04:36 < modd_:#liferay> yes
04:36 < modd_:#liferay> but I don't get it
04:39 < modd_:#liferay> wait..
