09:13 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> What the...something is totally messing with me right now.
09:13 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I add a web content display to a page, then I select a web content to be shown.
09:14 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> The rendered output looks completely wrong.
09:14 -!- mode/#liferay [+o jhf] by ChanServ
09:14 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Another template is used for it. When I directly click "Edit Template" on the Web Content View, the right template is shown.
09:14 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> What the...?!
09:17 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, are you sure that your request is being routed to the same server? going on what Olaf said yesterday --- maybe the display is your busted cluster box and the admin is the working one?
09:18 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey jhf could you help me trouble shoot some friendly url issues? I'm sure that I am doing something super simple wrong but I can't for the life of me (after a day of trying) figure out what it is
09:20 <@jhf:#liferay> sure! but I warn you ahead of time I don't know how friendlyUrls work internally
09:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> MAKES TWO OF US
09:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> lol
09:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> here is what I understand.
09:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> 1. I get that you configure the class that is used to generate them and that you give it a file with the definitions.
09:22 < jardineworks:#liferay> 2. Then I _THINK_ (would love for someone to confirm) it matches the route to use based on the parameters in the request vs. the ones defined in the <route/> configuration
09:23 <@jhf:#liferay> aren't friendlyUrls configured via the GUI? where do you place this friendlyUrl definition file?
09:23 < jardineworks:#liferay> 3. By default, all the implicit ones are handled on your behalf -- seen in one of the classes
09:24 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, liferay-portlet.xml -- you can specify friendly urls for your plugins
09:24 <@jhf:#liferay> ah
09:24 <@jhf:#liferay> ok. was not aware of this :)
09:25 < jardineworks:#liferay> so for example, my pagination ... istead of .....?p_p_id=...&p_p_lifecyle=0&....page=2&pagesize=10 ... I can have /view/page/2
09:25 < jardineworks:#liferay> awesome... how about you let me teach you what I know so far and then maybe you can help me figure out what I am doing wrong.
09:25 < jardineworks:#liferay> :)
09:27 < jardineworks:#liferay> if you have a plugin handy, add these lines to the liferay-portlet.xml (under the <icon/> tag)
09:27 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> jardineworks: I'm accessing the box directly at the moment. No routing involved. It's really confusing. I feel like I'm losing my mind.
09:28 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, http://pastebin.com/jxytXVQ0
09:28 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf,  adjeusting for your package of course.
09:28 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I'll tackle this again later. No clue what's going on there.
09:29 < jardineworks:#liferay> the http://localhost:8080/this/is/my/page/-/[friendly-url--mapping]
09:29 < jardineworks:#liferay> is what that will do ... and it should automagically remove all the portlet garbage in the url. Well, not garbage to liferay developers, but garbage to the rest of the world.
09:29 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, is all the cache complete disabled?
09:31 <@jhf:#liferay> jardineworks: so what happens? what are you doing that makes you think it's not working?
09:31 <@jhf:#liferay> is it simply not working? or halfway working? or just not working as expected?
09:31 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, half I think?
09:32 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, the issue I am facing is that I need to have multiple route definitions... but it doesn't seem to be picking them up properly and I can't figure out why.
09:32 <@jhf:#liferay> does it pick up any of them properly?
