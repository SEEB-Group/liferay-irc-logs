09:13 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> What the...something is totally messing with me right now.
09:13 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I add a web content display to a page, then I select a web content to be shown.
09:14 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> The rendered output looks completely wrong.
09:14 -!- mode/#liferay [+o jhf] by ChanServ
09:14 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Another template is used for it. When I directly click "Edit Template" on the Web Content View, the right template is shown.
09:14 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> What the...?!
09:17 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, are you sure that your request is being routed to the same server? going on what Olaf said yesterday --- maybe the display is your busted cluster box and the admin is the working one?
09:18 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey jhf could you help me trouble shoot some friendly url issues? I'm sure that I am doing something super simple wrong but I can't for the life of me (after a day of trying) figure out what it is
09:20 <@jhf:#liferay> sure! but I warn you ahead of time I don't know how friendlyUrls work internally
09:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> MAKES TWO OF US
09:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> lol
09:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> here is what I understand.
09:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> 1. I get that you configure the class that is used to generate them and that you give it a file with the definitions.
09:22 < jardineworks:#liferay> 2. Then I _THINK_ (would love for someone to confirm) it matches the route to use based on the parameters in the request vs. the ones defined in the <route/> configuration
09:23 <@jhf:#liferay> aren't friendlyUrls configured via the GUI? where do you place this friendlyUrl definition file?
09:23 < jardineworks:#liferay> 3. By default, all the implicit ones are handled on your behalf -- seen in one of the classes
09:24 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, liferay-portlet.xml -- you can specify friendly urls for your plugins
09:24 <@jhf:#liferay> ah
09:24 <@jhf:#liferay> ok. was not aware of this :)
