09:13 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> What the...something is totally messing with me right now.
09:13 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I add a web content display to a page, then I select a web content to be shown.
09:14 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> The rendered output looks completely wrong.
09:14 -!- mode/#liferay [+o jhf] by ChanServ
09:14 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Another template is used for it. When I directly click "Edit Template" on the Web Content View, the right template is shown.
09:14 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> What the...?!
09:17 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, are you sure that your request is being routed to the same server? going on what Olaf said yesterday --- maybe the display is your busted cluster box and the admin is the working one?
09:18 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey jhf could you help me trouble shoot some friendly url issues? I'm sure that I am doing something super simple wrong but I can't for the life of me (after a day of trying) figure out what it is
09:20 <@jhf:#liferay> sure! but I warn you ahead of time I don't know how friendlyUrls work internally
09:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> MAKES TWO OF US
09:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> lol
09:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> here is what I understand.
09:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> 1. I get that you configure the class that is used to generate them and that you give it a file with the definitions.
