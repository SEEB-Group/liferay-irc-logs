04:37 < topolik:#liferay> hehe :)
04:39 < hufg:#liferay> such a pain in the ass to change project name
06:58 < hufg:#liferay> lol if i access the site with server name my workflow tasks does not open edit task when pressing "assign to me"
06:58 < hufg:#liferay> through load balancer it opens the edit task view
06:58 < hufg:#liferay> that is just crazy
06:58 < hufg:#liferay> plain nuts
09:07 < hufg:#liferay> we need a liferay therapy group where you can bitch and whine
09:08 < Azrae|:#liferay> hufg: I thought this was it ;)
09:08 < hufg:#liferay> Azrae|: it should be strictly for bitching and whining
09:08 < hufg:#liferay> there is some good stuff here from time to time

09:10 < hufg:#liferay> anyone got ideas on web content wrecking structure field data
09:10 < hufg:#liferay> repeatable-field=field1, repeatable-field=field2, save --> field2 changes to field1
09:12 < hufg:#liferay> i have a huge structure and template :Z

09:27 < Azrae|:#liferay> hufg: I have no ideas (good or bad) on anything. Totally new to liferay, so hoping that by lurking here I'll learn stuff by osmosis
09:33 -!- mode/#liferay [+o jhf_] by ChanServ
09:44 < hufg:#liferay> Azrae|: yes yes that's a good plan
09:44 < hufg:#liferay> Azrae|: the most important thing is to get liferay src and import it to the ide of your choice
09:45 < hufg:#liferay> the second most important thing is to get rid of windows if you have one
09:46 < hufg:#liferay> then just learn to track everything you need
09:58 < Azrae|:#liferay> hufg: get rid of windows? oh I wish!
10:01 < hufg:#liferay> you are doomed without a decent shell+grep/sed/find

10:05 < pnutbutr_:#liferay> cygwin if you must!
10:07 < Azrae|:#liferay> I do have cygwin installed
10:08 < Azrae|:#liferay> and I won't actually be doing any development in liferay, that'll be for my colleagues :)
10:10 < hufg:#liferay> what will you be doing?
