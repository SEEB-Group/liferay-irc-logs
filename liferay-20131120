04:36 < hufg:#liferay> topolik: layouttpl is the correct string
04:36 < hufg:#liferay> goddamn motherfucking shit
04:36 < hufg:#liferay> 8)
04:37 < topolik:#liferay> hehe :)
04:39 < hufg:#liferay> such a pain in the ass to change project name
06:58 < hufg:#liferay> lol if i access the site with server name my workflow tasks does not open edit task when pressing "assign to me"
06:58 < hufg:#liferay> through load balancer it opens the edit task view
06:58 < hufg:#liferay> that is just crazy
06:58 < hufg:#liferay> plain nuts
09:07 < hufg:#liferay> we need a liferay therapy group where you can bitch and whine
09:08 < Azrae|:#liferay> hufg: I thought this was it ;)
09:08 < hufg:#liferay> Azrae|: it should be strictly for bitching and whining
09:08 < hufg:#liferay> there is some good stuff here from time to time
09:08 < hufg:#liferay> 8)
09:10 < hufg:#liferay> anyone got ideas on web content wrecking structure field data
09:10 < hufg:#liferay> repeatable-field=field1, repeatable-field=field2, save --> field2 changes to field1
09:12 < hufg:#liferay> i have a huge structure and template :Z
09:23 -!- mode/#liferay [+o jhf] by ChanServ
09:27 < Azrae|:#liferay> hufg: I have no ideas (good or bad) on anything. Totally new to liferay, so hoping that by lurking here I'll learn stuff by osmosis
09:33 -!- mode/#liferay [+o jhf_] by ChanServ
09:44 < hufg:#liferay> Azrae|: yes yes that's a good plan
09:44 < hufg:#liferay> Azrae|: the most important thing is to get liferay src and import it to the ide of your choice
09:45 < hufg:#liferay> the second most important thing is to get rid of windows if you have one
09:46 < hufg:#liferay> then just learn to track everything you need
09:58 < Azrae|:#liferay> hufg: get rid of windows? oh I wish!
10:01 < hufg:#liferay> you are doomed without a decent shell+grep/sed/find
10:01 < hufg:#liferay> 8)
10:05 < pnutbutr_:#liferay> cygwin if you must!
10:07 < Azrae|:#liferay> I do have cygwin installed
10:08 < Azrae|:#liferay> and I won't actually be doing any development in liferay, that'll be for my colleagues :)
10:10 < hufg:#liferay> what will you be doing?
10:12 < Azrae|:#liferay> hopefully nothing at all ;) because I'll be given stuff to do that I was hired to... however... coming back to reality... until we go live with a hosted solution I'm the one who installs our test server and keeps it going and hooks it up to ldap (and crashes ldap) etc.
10:56 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Having somebody who knows how to set up Liferay properly is important.
10:57 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Our current live system has a broken cluster config and everything is a huge mess.
10:57 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> We're trying to fix it, but Liferay infrastructure takes quite some research.
10:58 < Azrae|:#liferay> looking after our IBM websphere stuff for a few years has been a nightmare, so we are hoping a hosted solution will mean we do nothing but sit back and eat biscuits all day
10:59 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Good luck with that. :D
10:59 < Azrae|:#liferay> (though I suspect all the money we save from not paying IBM won't get spent on biscuits)
11:03 < hufg:#liferay> Azrae|: :D
11:03 < hufg:#liferay> haha
11:04 < hufg:#liferay> our hosting solution is a cljusterfuck
11:04 < hufg:#liferay> they get nothing right
11:05 < hufg:#liferay> the problem is that you'd need maintainers who know your liferay stuff intimately and this shit will never happen when hosted and maintained somewhere else
11:06 < hufg:#liferay> the process should be like hey i want you to deploy this and then they'd know how to deploy a hook, theme, portlet and whatever may go wrong with it or a new configuration
11:07 < hufg:#liferay> not like write step by step instructions with commands and pray to god no typos are present and then wait for your voodoo consultant to execute the steps
11:08 < hufg:#liferay> the only hope is they have dedicated people that will learn ie. no offshore rotations and shit like that+good management or that they host other liferay stuff
11:08 < Azrae|:#liferay> are you with a dedicated liferay hosting company?
