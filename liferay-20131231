03:31 < hufg:#liferay> rotty3000: topolik
03:32 < hufg:#liferay> any ideas why deployment fails because deployment dependencies are missing from /tmp?
03:32 < hufg:#liferay> anyone? 8)
04:08 < topolik:#liferay> hi hufg
04:09 < hufg:#liferay> topolik: i have a very zz pzz bug, there are  no issues
04:09 < hufg:#liferay> do you have any insights how the files could disappear?
04:09 < topolik:#liferay> I'm not sure I understand
04:09 < topolik:#liferay> which files?
04:09 < topolik:#liferay> what dependencies?
04:09 < hufg:#liferay> from /tmp/liferay/com/liferay/portal/deploy/dependencies
04:10 < hufg:#liferay> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/011c9f235d56b7ff6870
04:10 < hufg:#liferay> these files
04:10 < topolik:#liferay> hmm
04:10 < topolik:#liferay> got it
04:10 < topolik:#liferay> read/write permissions?
04:11 < hufg:#liferay> irrelevant, first they exist and then they don't
04:11 < topolik:#liferay> ok
04:11 < hufg:#liferay> basedeployer does not take this into account
04:11 < topolik:#liferay> I dive into code
04:11 < hufg:#liferay> thus the deployment is succesful but
04:11 < hufg:#liferay> but they don't work
04:11 < hufg:#liferay> you can see this by deleting the files manually and then deploying stuff
04:12 < hufg:#liferay> for example util-java.jar will result into missing PortletBeanLocator class
04:12 < hufg:#liferay> error message in log
04:14 < hufg:#liferay> there is some room for improvement imo
04:15 < hufg:#liferay> at which point these files disappear i don't know
04:17 < hufg:#liferay> https://issues.liferay.com/browse/LPS-30750
04:17 < hufg:#liferay> probably same stuff
04:18 < hufg:#liferay> but the issue is so bad in general
04:18 < hufg:#liferay> description and comments
04:18 < hufg:#liferay> same env
04:18 < hufg:#liferay> glassfish 3.1.2.2
04:20 < hufg:#liferay> perhaps app server related problem
04:20 < hufg:#liferay> or general environment
04:20 < hufg:#liferay> probably yes because you'd have much more complaints on forums/issues
04:25 < topolik:#liferay> hmm, I see
