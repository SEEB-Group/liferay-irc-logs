05:44 < mtsr:#liferay> I dumped the liferay database on an old server and reloaded it on a new server, with the same liferay version. Most everything is working, EXCEPT the old users are not showing up in the Users & Organizations view in the admin panel. Any ideas what could be wrong?
05:51 < mtsr:#liferay> Ok, found it, problem with the search index
06:03 < modd_:#liferay> anyone using liferay with postgres? I have problems with service builder and saving blobs :\
07:57 -!- mode/#liferay [+o jhf] by ChanServ
08:03 < modd_:#liferay> hi jhf, any idea how I can use blobs in service builder with postgresql?
08:04 <@jhf:#liferay> umm.. is this related to "how to use inputstreams in servicebuilder impl methods" ?
08:20 < modd_:#liferay> nope
08:21 < modd_:#liferay> @jhf: we are storing an image into a table. the type of the table is blob. works great with mysql but postres says: large objects may not be used in auto-commit mode
08:21 <@jhf:#liferay> hmmm
08:22 < modd_:#liferay> this message appears when fetching the image, but not when saving something
08:22 < modd_:#liferay> the type of the table in postres however, is "oid" and it's a numeric value
08:22 <@jhf:#liferay> with Liferay 6.2?
08:22 < modd_:#liferay> postgres*
08:22 < modd_:#liferay> yep
08:23 < modd_:#liferay> ga2
08:23 <@jhf:#liferay> k.. well this was reported but supposedly fixed: https://issues.liferay.com/browse/LPS-26839
08:24 < modd_:#liferay> I have no idea what I could do else besides rebuilding everything
08:24 < modd_:#liferay> I know that ticket but it doesn't help :\
08:26 <@jhf:#liferay> also one of our tests failed due to this and was fixed here https://issues.liferay.com/browse/LPS-42265 in 7.x but i'm browsing to see if there's a workaround (or if this is the same as your issue)
08:28 < modd_:#liferay> the main problem is, that I have to make service builder to build it correctly
08:28 <@jhf:#liferay> so according to stackoverflow and the above bug the problem is that our sql doesn't enclose the code that writes large blobs in a transaction
08:28 < modd_:#liferay> so I can't use any annotation-based solutions
08:28 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah I'm seeing if there's a workaround you can do
08:30 <@jhf:#liferay> after you build the service, I wonder if you could add @Transactional annotation to one of the generated classes
08:30 <@jhf:#liferay> tried that?
08:30 < modd_:#liferay> not sure where to add it
08:33 < modd_:#liferay> afaik I have to add it to the persistence impl but this class will be rewritten when using build-service
08:33 <@jhf:#liferay> well I would look at the stack trace, most likely it is passing through your XXXXLocalServiceImpl class - which ever method (maybe updateXXX() ?) it in that stack trace, add it to that one and re-deploy (but do not re-build services)
08:33 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah that is true
08:34 <@jhf:#liferay> I'm surprised it's not in the sql or the classes we generate.
08:34 < modd_:#liferay> the method is getData()
08:35 <@jhf:#liferay> looks like we fixed it here but only for document library: https://github.com/shuyangzhou/liferay-portal/commit/44ed0cbef0f138750ac4264f026ffc4c56bc26ae
08:36 <@jhf:#liferay> if you add it to your own impl service class it won't be overwritten.. just dunno if that would fix it.
08:38 < modd_:#liferay> well, it creates a temp file and uses its inputstream, isn't it?
08:39 <@jhf:#liferay> yep.. that's what that fix does. I thihk that's just for the "get" operation. for the "put" operation, it just adds a @Transactional annotation
08:40 <@jhf:#liferay> is it failing only for the "get" operation for you?
08:40 < modd_:#liferay> ok...I've added the annotation to the getter and this gives me a new error: PSQLException: Error: invalid LargeObject Descriptor: 0
08:41 < modd_:#liferay> setting seems to work at least without errors
08:41 <@jhf:#liferay> ok. I guess the "get" requires that temp file workaround bit.. which sounds.. sub-optimal.
08:42 < modd_:#liferay> postgres is %&"&%"
08:42 < modd_:#liferay> ...
09:03 < modd_:#liferay> takes a bit more time as I have to make a blob out of the temp file again
09:07 < jardineworks_:#liferay> jhf, \o/
09:08 < jardineworks_:#liferay> jhf, sorry I ddin't catch up with you again at the Sumposium man, it was a bit of a bad timing trip for me
09:08 < jardineworks_:#liferay> I actually had to leave early yesterday because I realized part way through the day I had left my wedding ring in the place I had rented.
09:08 < jardineworks_:#liferay> married six weeks and lost my ring already haha.
09:09 < jardineworks_:#liferay> (got it back though :) )
09:17 < modd_:#liferay> jhf: it doesn't work, same error. but in debug mode, I can stop the execution and have a look at the blob. there's an internal private jdbc3blob with a LargeObject object, and if Ichange the value of the autocommit field to 'false' and save it, it finally works
09:18 < modd_:#liferay> but as the whole thing is private, I cannot fix it, I guess
