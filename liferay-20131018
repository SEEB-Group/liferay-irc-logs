00:44 < rocknroll_:#liferay> the lack of documentatipn can be a little.. challenging :>
02:04 < simon__:#liferay> hi
05:03 < modd_:#liferay> rotty3000: I'm configurating a lr 6.2 rc4 test at the moment and I see, that the default db didn't change yet and the option to change it is still somehow "hidden" (just a small link while there's a big fat button to go on with the installation). :(
05:56 < modd_:#liferay> hmm, 191 users on a fresh installation but it shows only 1 in the list
06:13 < modd_:#liferay> the marketplace shows me "portlet not available" if I try to "purchase" a free app
08:17 < imox1234:#liferay> hello I have the Image Gallery plugin and it is a little bit buggy :(
08:29 < imox1234:#liferay> all pictures are overlaped and I can not sea the new uploaded pictures

10:02 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> hi, is there a way to create a filter in the service builder?
10:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> avinashrbhat, you mean a finder method?
10:06 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> jardineworks, no finder finds only the rows which exactly matches the given value of the columns given, right?
10:07 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> jardineworks, i need some equations over those values provided
10:07 < jardineworks:#liferay> avinashrbhat, depends on how you code it .. but I suppose that is one of the ways
10:07 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> like `date > somedate`
10:07 < jardineworks:#liferay> avinashrbhat, you can define your own finder logic
10:07 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> jardineworks, in service builder?
10:07 < jardineworks:#liferay> You just modify the *LocalServiceImpl class and re-run the build-service target.
10:08 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> hmm.
10:08 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> ok
10:08 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> jardineworks, thanks
10:08 < jardineworks:#liferay> np
10:08 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> i was looking if there was  anything other than that.
10:08 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> :-)
