04:32 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> hi there
04:33 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> I would like to know when the init.vm (from a theme) file variables are initialized ? And can we go search for another community's pages when we init those vars ?
11:29 < Urug_:#liferay> There is DEFAULT_PARENT_FOLDER_ID = 0; in DLFolderConstants, but when i call DLFolderLocalService.getFolder(0); the result is null. I need to get some default folder, how to do that.
16:28 < Ujj:#liferay> Hi
16:29 < Ujj:#liferay> I am new to liferay. I have setup liferay development environment. And downloaded and imported portal and plugin source code from repository into eclipse.
16:29 < Ujj:#liferay> But none of my portlet code compiles. It is giving me so many errors. Can you help me in this?
16:38 < Urug_:#liferay> Do you use Ant or Maven?
16:46 < Ujj:#liferay> Ant
16:47 < Ujj:#liferay> I downloaded the eclipse bundled with liferay IDE and imported portal and plugin source code on it
16:49 < Ujj:#liferay> The mail portlet shows 0 count for all unread messages. The pull request for this says its been fixed. But I dont see it. So I wanted to fix this and deploy. But before making any changes only nothing compiles..
