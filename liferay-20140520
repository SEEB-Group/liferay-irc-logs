05:53 < dave_k1> hey all ... we're thinking about re-using the userids from a legacy system while importing them into LR6.2. how can we explicitely set the userId of a new, programmatically generated user? -- or is it a bad idea?
06:01 < modd_> you can setUserId() and update the user
06:01 < modd_> but I wouldn't do it
06:01 < modd_> why would you want to reuse old ids of another system?
06:02 < modd_> you could add an expando to your user and transfer the old id into this field
06:02 < dave_k> would setUserId also change references?
06:02 < modd_> I don't think so
06:04 < dave_k> modd_: it would make it easier to import the data from the old system.
06:04 < modd_> does your new system already exists?
06:04 < modd_> or do you want to migrate into a new liferay?
06:06 < modd_> you cannot simply mix the databases of two installations, it's not only the user table but everything, which could simply blow up
06:07 < dave_k> old system: legacy php stuff that started with PHP2. new system: fresh liferay 6.2 with standard database scheme + modified clean database scheme of old php system
06:08 < dave_k> but as we know that migrating a DB designed by a PHP noob is not side-effect-free, we would like to keep the userIds...
06:10 < modd_> you could create another table which matches old and new ids
06:10 < dave_k> the other option would be a translation table to translate between them...
06:12 < dave_k> ... but as we know that that userId is also the Customer ID on company letters, identifying the user in all communication, we would need to change some UI so that the staff wouldn't be irritated
06:14 < modd_> how about creating an own service with the service builder, which also provides some methods you can later use and fill its table by hand with your existing data
06:16 < dave_k> that's already on our schedule. current question is: how can we match the old userIds with liferay?
06:17 < modd_> screennames?
