05:53 < dave_k1> hey all ... we're thinking about re-using the userids from a legacy system while importing them into LR6.2. how can we explicitely set the userId of a new, programmatically generated user? -- or is it a bad idea?
06:01 < modd_> you can setUserId() and update the user
06:01 < modd_> but I wouldn't do it
06:01 < modd_> why would you want to reuse old ids of another system?
06:02 < modd_> you could add an expando to your user and transfer the old id into this field
06:02 < dave_k> would setUserId also change references?
06:02 < modd_> I don't think so
06:04 < dave_k> modd_: it would make it easier to import the data from the old system.
06:04 < modd_> does your new system already exists?
06:04 < modd_> or do you want to migrate into a new liferay?
06:06 < modd_> you cannot simply mix the databases of two installations, it's not only the user table but everything, which could simply blow up
06:07 < dave_k> old system: legacy php stuff that started with PHP2. new system: fresh liferay 6.2 with standard database scheme + modified clean database scheme of old php system
