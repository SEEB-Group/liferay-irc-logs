05:53 < dave_k1> hey all ... we're thinking about re-using the userids from a legacy system while importing them into LR6.2. how can we explicitely set the userId of a new, programmatically generated user? -- or is it a bad idea?
06:01 < modd_> you can setUserId() and update the user
06:01 < modd_> but I wouldn't do it
06:01 < modd_> why would you want to reuse old ids of another system?
06:02 < modd_> you could add an expando to your user and transfer the old id into this field
