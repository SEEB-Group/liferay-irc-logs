05:12 < Yam`:#liferay> already woken up jardineworks?
09:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> Yam`, I am now. Sort of anyway.
09:10 < Yam`:#liferay> haha
09:10 < Yam`:#liferay> that's because you joined at 10:47 FR, I was surprised! you must have disconnected in fact
09:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> Yam`, ah -- I never turn my computer off so you may see me as in the room but I might not be at my machine.
09:17 < Yam`:#liferay> yes that's just the connection which misleaded me :)
