09:12 < guli1:#liferay> Hi
09:12 < guli1:#liferay> Is there someone that can help me with Liferay @transactional issue?
09:22 < topolik:#liferay> guli1: perhaps, what's the issue?
09:41 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik, are variables declared in the theme available in the layout templates?
09:56 < guli1:#liferay> topolik: hey topolik
09:57 < guli1:#liferay> topolik: after 1 day of investigations i've found that the issue is linked to cache.
09:57 < guli1:#liferay> topolik: the transaction are well rollbacked but the cache is not...
09:57 < guli1:#liferay> topolik: i search for documentation on this (dark) side of liferay but i didn't found.... :(
09:58 < guli1:#liferay> sorry the initial issue is that data are not rollbacked when my service throws a PortalException...
10:14 < topolik:#liferay> jardineworks: I believe they are either the same or similar - except what's defined in init.vm
10:14 < topolik:#liferay> guli1: uhm, I think I remember some issue
10:14 < topolik:#liferay> guli1: let me search JIRA
10:17 < guli1:#liferay> topolik: portal.transactional.cache is enabled .
10:22 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik, except meaning that those in init.vm are not present?
10:22 < topolik:#liferay> jardineworks: right
10:22 < topolik:#liferay> those which are created by init.vm
