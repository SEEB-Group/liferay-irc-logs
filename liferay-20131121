08:03 < guli1:#liferay> Hi
08:04 < guli1:#liferay> Is there someone that can help me with Liferay @transactional issue?
09:12 < guli1:#liferay> Hi
09:12 < guli1:#liferay> Is there someone that can help me with Liferay @transactional issue?
09:22 < topolik:#liferay> guli1: perhaps, what's the issue?
09:41 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik, are variables declared in the theme available in the layout templates?
09:56 < guli1:#liferay> topolik: hey topolik
09:57 < guli1:#liferay> topolik: after 1 day of investigations i've found that the issue is linked to cache.
09:57 < guli1:#liferay> topolik: the transaction are well rollbacked but the cache is not...
09:57 < guli1:#liferay> topolik: i search for documentation on this (dark) side of liferay but i didn't found.... :(
09:58 < guli1:#liferay> sorry the initial issue is that data are not rollbacked when my service throws a PortalException...
10:14 < topolik:#liferay> jardineworks: I believe they are either the same or similar - except what's defined in init.vm
10:14 < topolik:#liferay> guli1: uhm, I think I remember some issue
10:14 < topolik:#liferay> guli1: let me search JIRA
10:17 < guli1:#liferay> topolik: portal.transactional.cache is enabled .
10:22 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik, except meaning that those in init.vm are not present?
10:22 < topolik:#liferay> jardineworks: right
10:22 < topolik:#liferay> those which are created by init.vm
10:23 < jardineworks:#liferay> gotcha. ok thanks :)
10:23 < topolik:#liferay>  n/p )
10:24 < topolik:#liferay> guli1: just a question - in your transaction, do you use just one thread?
10:25 < guli1:#liferay> i use PortletEntity service mixed with core Liferay services
10:25 < guli1:#liferay> topolik: i can give you some code if you want
10:28 < guli1:#liferay> topolik: i continue searching and it seems that there is localCacheAvailable in EntityCacheImpl, so value is got from the localCache and not from the portalCache.
10:28 < guli1:#liferay> topolik: the portalCache is transactional and not the local.
10:55 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik, do you know how to include stuff like this <!--[if gte IE 8]><!--> in the portal_normal.vm?
10:57 < guli1:#liferay> topolik: no idea of where i can get documentation on that point?
10:58 < jardineworks:#liferay> i dunno.. the front end wizards put it in lol
10:59 < jardineworks:#liferay> I am getting Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token <  in my chrome console
10:59 < jardineworks:#liferay> I assumed it was from that
10:59 < jardineworks:#liferay> but maybe not
10:59 < jardineworks:#liferay> actually... it looks like it is in ok
11:00 < guli1:#liferay> jardineworks:     <!--[if lte IE 8]>
11:00 < guli1:#liferay> 		<script src="$javascript_folder/respond.min.js"></script>
11:00 < guli1:#liferay>     <![endif]-->
11:00 < guli1:#liferay> jardineworks: i think that the [endif] is missing
11:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> guli1, Nah, I just didn't paste the whole thing :)
11:01 < jardineworks:#liferay>     <!--[if gte IE 8]><!-->
11:01 < jardineworks:#liferay>         <script src="javascripts/vendor/jquery.parallax.min.js"></script>
11:01 < jardineworks:#liferay>         <script src="javascripts/main-banner-parallax-ck.js"></script>
11:01 < jardineworks:#liferay>     <!--<![endif]-->	
11:06 < guli1:#liferay> jardineworks: but you have <!--> that i did't have
11:06 < guli1:#liferay> jardineworks: what do you add this?
11:08 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Is there a default Liferay webservice that can be used to retrieve a rendered journal article?
11:09 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I couldn't find one...retrieving structure, template and content separately does nothing for me.
11:12 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Or is /c/journal/view_article_content the right way to do it?
11:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> guli1, i dunno.. that's a question for the guys :). Looks pointless to me ... but they did that a few places so I left it in.
11:15 < guli1:#liferay> have you try to remove it?
11:17 < jardineworks:#liferay> nope
11:17 < jardineworks:#liferay> drop to client tomorrow... no time for experimentation to be honest :)
11:34 < topolik:#liferay> jardineworks: guli1: guys, I'm sorry, I have some family obligations, will be back in about 2-3hrs, thanks
11:59 < guli1:#liferay> topolik: no problem dude.
12:00 < guli1:#liferay> topolik: i found a way to workaround this issue by disabling the local cache.
12:00 < guli1:#liferay> using in portal.properties
12:00 < guli1:#liferay> ##Disable local cache
12:00 < guli1:#liferay> value.object.finder.thread.local.cache.max.size=0
12:00 < guli1:#liferay> value.object.entity.thread.local.cache.max.size=0
16:25 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey rotty3000 -- do you have a second for a cache question?
16:27 < jardineworks:#liferay> or jhf maybe? -- I am pushing some collections I have (custom model objects) into the cache, but then after a few retrievals (which appear to work without issue) I start getting class cast exceptions
16:30 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah, sorry, that sounds like a rotty3000 question...
