04:55 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> hi, anyone here know how to add the language strings for a theme settings?
07:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik, Tar-Minyatur finally live! www.sprouts.com
07:12 < topolik:#liferay> jardineworks: wow

07:14 < topolik:#liferay> haha, good >> http://www.sprouts.com/healthy-living-resources/-/article-filter/view/page/1/Recipes-and-Non-GMO-and-Vegetarian-and-Dairy-Free-and-Sprouts_Brand-or-How-To
07:15 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik, that tiles search results layout was a bugger. I begged them to let me use masonry but nope.
07:15 < jardineworks:#liferay> damn near needed a math degree to get it working.
07:16 < topolik:#liferay> uh, when I click on the log I go to: /web/guest :D
07:18 < jardineworks:#liferay> when you clicked on the what?
07:18 < topolik:#liferay> ahh, sorry, logo :D
07:18 < jardineworks:#liferay> haha
07:18 < jardineworks:#liferay> awesome
07:18 < topolik:#liferay> looks nice, really
07:19 < jardineworks:#liferay> i can take no credit for the presentation -- but yes, it is a beautiful site.
07:19 < jardineworks:#liferay> and, as you know, 100% responsive.
07:20 < topolik:#liferay> hmm, nice
07:21 < topolik:#liferay> doesn't even look like a portal
07:22 < jardineworks:#liferay> i know! that is the best part! hahaha
07:22 < jardineworks:#liferay> and a big thanks to you topolik. I have not forgotten the help you gave me in answering so many of my questions.
07:22 < jardineworks:#liferay> and mikogo :)
07:31 < topolik:#liferay> jardineworks: once it's 1000 beers let me know, I'll go to visit you and stay for 1 year (~3 beers a day) :D
08:08 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik, hahaha right now I am on to a dfferent project. Finishing my house -- this week I am going to try to finish the loft I built.
08:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> Then I will have an extra room for you to sleep off 4 beers a day ;)
08:12 < topolik:#liferay> jardineworks: that's a really nice project, good luck! Better than most of online projects
08:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik, last weeks completed project -- http://postimg.org/image/vxd3fwdnx/d12dc5fa/
08:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> (the table)
08:13 < topolik:#liferay> wow, looks very stable
08:17 < jardineworks:#liferay> hahaha -- rock solid. Also weighs about 300 pounds.
08:18 < jardineworks:#liferay> nah, more like 200, but the point is you need a running start to move it :)

08:58 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf! \o/
08:58 < jardineworks:#liferay> http://www.sprouts.com -- finally live!
09:01 <@jhf:#liferay> \o/
09:01 <@jhf:#liferay> congrats!
09:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> thanks :)
09:02 < jardineworks:#liferay> thanks to you as well, you topolik and rotty3000 helped me out a lot when I was stumped
09:02 <@jhf:#liferay> dang there are no sprouts stores in my area
09:02 < jardineworks:#liferay> fully responsive as well of course.
09:02 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah that is super awesome
09:02 < jardineworks:#liferay> no locations yet but they are growing like wild fire.
09:03 <@jhf:#liferay> they are just in phoenix ?
09:05 <@jhf:#liferay> also if I click on the sprouts logo at the top-left, the url changes to /web/guest
09:06 <@jhf:#liferay> and finally.. the favicon is the liferay logo! woohoo!!
09:06 <@jhf:#liferay> oh wait no.. it's an apple.
09:07 <@jhf:#liferay> I think I may have accessed it in the past when it was the LR logo
09:35 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, They are in 6 states I think. If you go to the store locator I think it only provides you the states that they have locations in.
09:36 < jardineworks:#liferay> the web/guest was something topolik noted as well. I'll send a note over to let them know.
09:36 < jardineworks:#liferay> once they pay me
09:36 < jardineworks:#liferay> :)
09:53 < sm`:#liferay> hello... i'm trying to reference two liferay portlet project and in the liferay ide (eclipse) everything looks fine
09:53 < sm`:#liferay> the intelisense is right
09:53 < sm`:#liferay> compiling process is fine
09:54 < sm`:#liferay> but i get a java.lang.ClassNotFoundException when deployed on server
09:54 < sm`:#liferay> the project is added int the properties -> buildpath... the order is checked and everything
10:01 < sm`:#liferay> i also tried adding the project in properties -> project references
10:03 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> hi there
10:13 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> Question on liferay 5.2.3 + struts bridge : all our sources are packaged in the WEB-INF/src directory when creating a war from ant script. Any idea how to remove them ?
10:34 < topolik:#liferay> nicolas_FR: try this: https://www.liferay.com/community/forums/-/message_boards/message/24164305
10:37 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> topolik: hi, thanks but I already saw this post. Fact is this property is 6.1.1, and we're on 5.2.3 actually
10:48 < topolik:#liferay> nicolas_FR: build-common-plugin.xml, line 228, add: excludes="${plugins.war.excludes}"
10:48 < topolik:#liferay> or redefine "war" task in your build.xml
10:55 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> topolik : thanks ! Where could I see the declaration of variables ? like ${plugins.war.excludes}"
10:56 < topolik:#liferay> add it into build.<username>.properties
10:56 < topolik:#liferay> this one is not declared (in 5.2.3) ;)
10:56 < topolik:#liferay> you find the others in build.properties
10:56 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> ok thanks
10:57 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> something like this ? : plugins.war.excludes=**/WEB-INF/src/*
10:59 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> topolik : plugins.war.excludes=**/WEB-INF/src/* removed my .properties files, but all directories and .java are still presents
