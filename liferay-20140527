05:45 < rocknrol1_> anyone got NTLM to work? ths is driving me  nuts
05:45 < rocknrol1_> session key negotiation failed
05:59 < modd_> ntlm works fine but may generate some headache ;)
06:00 < modd_> the last time I had this error you mention, my service user was the same user as the windows server where liferay runs. I've created another independent service user and it worked
06:06 < rocknrol1_> oh, ok
06:26 < rocknrol1_> so is there anything special that I need to know, when I ask my sysadmin to create a different user (or adjust the existing one)
06:27 < rocknrol1_> I am not familiar with this windows stuff. so it needs to be a service user
06:28 < rocknrol1_> I've enabled all logs I can think of in Liferay, but it's not helping
06:53 < modd_> sry, don't know, just follow the ntlm steps in the wiki
07:23 < rocknrol1_> do you have a link to the wiki? my LR is 6.1.2. I found a wiki, but it seemed very old, all images were missing

12:21 < sm`pid> the forum seems dead also :)
13:17 < barrie> Have a PACL issue in 6.2
13:17 < barrie> I have portal.security.manager.strategy=liferay in portal-ext.properties set
13:17 < barrie> and in my hook in liferay-plugin-package.properties
13:18 < barrie> have security-manager-enabled=generate
13:18 < barrie> but get no errors and no file created... if I set it to
13:18 < barrie> security-manager-enabled=true
13:18 < barrie> I still get no errors
13:18 < barrie> this is 6.2 GA2
13:18 < barrie> is there some issue with PACL not processing in hooks?
14:04 < testa> is the whole liferay community dead?
14:12 < modd> nope
14:12 < modd> it's asleep
14:20 < testa> when is it awake?
14:28 < barrie> posted in https://www.liferay.com/community/forums/-/message_boards/message/38236248
14:28 < barrie> in case anyone has any ideas - thanks
14:33 < barrie> Ah... never mind... for to enable security in Tomcat :-(
14:35 < modd> hey rotty3000: does liferay plan to allow the site and page structure to be visible in the url someday? like localhost:8080/web/parentsite/childsite/parentpage/childpage/childchildpage?
16:00 < testa> everyone is asleep in this place
16:16 < testa> hello?
16:17 < testa> Could you build a webapp similar to facebook on liferay?
16:27 < bijoo_> testa: yes, completely supports and more.
16:27 < testa> how much could a single server support? Average specs?
16:28 < bijoo_> testa: there was someone else asking same questions; check the official Liferay  whitepapers: https://www.liferay.com/documentation/additional-resources/whitepapers
16:29 < testa> Im very skeptical, as with even the intial page load of a base installation takes on average 6 seconds to load.
16:29 < testa> On a machine with 16GB RAM and a Core i7
16:29 < testa> With one user
16:29 < bijoo_> testa: what are the JVM settings given?
