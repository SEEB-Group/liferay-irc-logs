05:45 < rocknrol1_> anyone got NTLM to work? ths is driving me  nuts
05:45 < rocknrol1_> session key negotiation failed
05:59 < modd_> ntlm works fine but may generate some headache ;)
06:00 < modd_> the last time I had this error you mention, my service user was the same user as the windows server where liferay runs. I've created another independent service user and it worked
06:06 < rocknrol1_> oh, ok
06:26 < rocknrol1_> so is there anything special that I need to know, when I ask my sysadmin to create a different user (or adjust the existing one)
06:27 < rocknrol1_> I am not familiar with this windows stuff. so it needs to be a service user
06:28 < rocknrol1_> I've enabled all logs I can think of in Liferay, but it's not helping
