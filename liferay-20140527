05:45 < rocknrol1_> anyone got NTLM to work? ths is driving me  nuts
05:45 < rocknrol1_> session key negotiation failed
05:59 < modd_> ntlm works fine but may generate some headache ;)
06:00 < modd_> the last time I had this error you mention, my service user was the same user as the windows server where liferay runs. I've created another independent service user and it worked
06:06 < rocknrol1_> oh, ok
06:26 < rocknrol1_> so is there anything special that I need to know, when I ask my sysadmin to create a different user (or adjust the existing one)
06:27 < rocknrol1_> I am not familiar with this windows stuff. so it needs to be a service user
06:28 < rocknrol1_> I've enabled all logs I can think of in Liferay, but it's not helping
06:53 < modd_> sry, don't know, just follow the ntlm steps in the wiki
07:23 < rocknrol1_> do you have a link to the wiki? my LR is 6.1.2. I found a wiki, but it seemed very old, all images were missing

12:02 < testa> Greetings!
12:21 < sm`pid> https://www.liferay.com/community/forums/-/message_boards/message/38227467
12:21 < sm`pid> the forum seems dead also :)
13:17 < barrie> Have a PACL issue in 6.2
13:17 < barrie> I have portal.security.manager.strategy=liferay in portal-ext.properties set
13:17 < barrie> and in my hook in liferay-plugin-package.properties
13:18 < barrie> have security-manager-enabled=generate
13:18 < barrie> but get no errors and no file created... if I set it to
13:18 < barrie> security-manager-enabled=true
13:18 < barrie> I still get no errors
13:18 < barrie> this is 6.2 GA2
13:18 < barrie> is there some issue with PACL not processing in hooks?
14:04 < testa> is the whole liferay community dead?
14:12 < modd> nope
14:12 < modd> it's asleep
14:20 < testa> when is it awake?
14:28 < barrie> posted in https://www.liferay.com/community/forums/-/message_boards/message/38236248
14:28 < barrie> in case anyone has any ideas - thanks
14:33 < barrie> Ah... never mind... for to enable security in Tomcat :-(
14:35 < modd> hey rotty3000: does liferay plan to allow the site and page structure to be visible in the url someday? like localhost:8080/web/parentsite/childsite/parentpage/childpage/childchildpage?
16:00 < testa> everyone is asleep in this place
16:16 < testa> hello?
16:17 < testa> Could you build a webapp similar to facebook on liferay?
16:27 < bijoo_> testa: yes, completely supports and more.
16:27 < testa> how much could a single server support? Average specs?
16:28 < bijoo_> testa: there was someone else asking same questions; check the official Liferay  whitepapers: https://www.liferay.com/documentation/additional-resources/whitepapers
16:29 < testa> Im very skeptical, as with even the intial page load of a base installation takes on average 6 seconds to load.
16:29 < testa> On a machine with 16GB RAM and a Core i7
16:29 < testa> With one user
16:29 < bijoo_> testa: what are the JVM settings given?
16:30 < testa> Base installation, no changes.
16:30 < bijoo_> testa: plus note Liferay has aggressive caching; so initial startup needs some warmup; try clicking around and you'll see speedup.
16:30 < testa> the CSS file is 4 thousand lines, thats a bit ridiculous.
16:31 < bijoo_> testa: it's very flexible so that's on start; can customize up to whazoo all things.
16:31 < testa> is there a minimal installation available?
16:32 < testa> It also seems that the only JS file it can load is main.js? Is this correct?
16:32 < bijoo_> testa: that's a great question and know what you mean; I don't know of any such offering; though I've thought about rolling one of own.
16:33 < bijoo_> testa: not sure what you mean, but can load any. 5000+ properties to choose from.
16:33 < testa> Ive just checked out creating themes, I tried to load my own js file in the diffs folder, but it seems it doesnt load. Even when I include <script> in the  .ftl file.
16:33 < bijoo_> testa: https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/blob/6.2.1-ga2/portal-impl/src/portal.properties
16:34 < bijoo_> testa: have you read the documentation there?
16:34 < testa> I see, this is where you specify the includes?
16:35 < bijoo_> testa: correct, in specific try this javascript.bundle.ids

16:36 < bijoo_> testa: it takes time to take in all the info; but I've worked this 5 years, never looked back.
16:36 < testa> very useful.
16:36 < testa> What is the property to set the initial page? Not the page after login, the page before login.
16:36 < bijoo_> testa: best part is open source and reviewed code;
16:37 < bijoo_> testa: that can be done both trough UI and prop.
16:37 < bijoo_> testa: Google it and you'll find many answers.
16:38 < testa> I just did, it seems everyone is saying default.landing.page.path
16:38 < testa> I just tried that, that property is for the page after login.
16:40 < bijoo_> testa: through the UI, you can do this: control panel->portal settings->Home url
16:41 < bijoo_> testa:     company.default.home.url=/web/guest
16:41 < bijoo_> testa: and that's the way to set through properties.
16:42 < testa> I see. Indeed this file is large. Does it load every time a request comes through?
16:46 < bijoo_> testa: no, why you think it loads on each request?
