03:04 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> has anyone used liferay 6,2 GA1?
03:28 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> the liferay 6.2 is noticeably slower. does anyone know why it is so?
06:04 < Krugger:#liferay> hi, just got an old 5.2 liferay portal under my care and would like to upgrade it to the latest 6.2. Is there an upgrade guide? Still reading through the documentation, but haven't seen an update chapter yet.
06:24 < modd_:#liferay> hi rotty3000, I've created a ticket for my problem I mentioned last time: LPS-43932 (the formating is a bit wrong but I can't edit it anymore :\)
06:24 < modd_:#liferay> Krugger: yep, there's a upgrade guide
06:25 < Krugger:#liferay> but the upgrade instruction are just like decompress the new version and point it to your database, is it really that simple?
06:26 < Krugger:#liferay> I am thinking of testing it out in a VM before I destroy production
06:27 < modd_:#liferay> http://www.liferay.com/documentation/liferay-portal/6.2/user-guide/-/ai/upgrading-liferay-liferay-portal-6-2-user-guide-18-en
06:27 < modd_:#liferay> well, you shouldn't do it simply on your production db and data without backups
06:27 < modd_:#liferay> try it with a copied version first
