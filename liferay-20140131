03:04 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> has anyone used liferay 6,2 GA1?
03:28 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> the liferay 6.2 is noticeably slower. does anyone know why it is so?
06:04 < Krugger:#liferay> hi, just got an old 5.2 liferay portal under my care and would like to upgrade it to the latest 6.2. Is there an upgrade guide? Still reading through the documentation, but haven't seen an update chapter yet.
06:24 < modd_:#liferay> hi rotty3000, I've created a ticket for my problem I mentioned last time: LPS-43932 (the formating is a bit wrong but I can't edit it anymore :\)
06:24 < modd_:#liferay> Krugger: yep, there's a upgrade guide
06:25 < Krugger:#liferay> but the upgrade instruction are just like decompress the new version and point it to your database, is it really that simple?
06:26 < Krugger:#liferay> I am thinking of testing it out in a VM before I destroy production
06:27 < modd_:#liferay> http://www.liferay.com/documentation/liferay-portal/6.2/user-guide/-/ai/upgrading-liferay-liferay-portal-6-2-user-guide-18-en
06:27 < modd_:#liferay> well, you shouldn't do it simply on your production db and data without backups
06:27 < modd_:#liferay> try it with a copied version first
06:35 < Krugger:#liferay> most people seem to have less problems with mysql than postgresql, so it seems it is a bad idea to change the database during this upgrade, right?
06:43 < modd_:#liferay> yes^^
08:46 < tom235321:#liferay> hello, last days I had problems with my Liferay Server. Its MySQL Backend has too many open connections, so liferay stop serving content. I am using hibernate without connection pools. Is it a known behavior?

10:19 < Krugger:#liferay> tom235321: I just got my hands on liferay so I have near zero experience in liferay, but I noticed you can control the amount of connection to the database in the portal-ext.properties file
10:37 <@jhf:#liferay> hey denissignoretto1 - you there?
11:55 < denissignoretto1:#liferay> Hi jhf, yes! I'm there!!!
11:56 < denissignoretto1:#liferay> I'm struggling with websphere and Security !!! :) - and now I take a little rest
11:57 <@jhf:#liferay> ugh.. well sorry to hear that.. denis is one of our top contributors from Q4 2013, so *clap clap clap* for that. Also, I wanted to mention we will have the drawing for the big prize on this channel tomorrow, at 10am EST (4pm CET). So if you're here, you can see what you've won :)
11:58 <@jhf:#liferay> you don't have to be present to win, but it's fun !
11:58 <@jhf:#liferay> oh wait. tomorrow's saturday.
11:58 <@jhf:#liferay> hmm.. maybe we wait for monday.
12:03 < modd:#liferay> jhf: seems like users on liferay.com can't use the document library
12:04 <@jhf:#liferay> oh?
12:05 < modd:#liferay> the question is, is it because of security or why
12:05 <@jhf:#liferay> I think individual doclibs for users are no longer available. is that what you mean?
12:05 < modd:#liferay> yep
12:05 < denissignoretto1:#liferay> thanks, jhf... I was curoious about IRC, I wasn't used... it's my first time here!
12:05 < modd:#liferay> but I can still upload files^^
12:06 < modd:#liferay> check my account, I've uploaded the screenshots for my problem with content sharing
12:07 < modd:#liferay> btw, new ticket: LPS-43932
12:07 < modd:#liferay> I can't edit my own tickets...again^^
12:07 <@jhf:#liferay> how did you upload the screenshots? via the wysiwyg editor? or your profile?
12:07 < modd:#liferay> the editor^^
12:09 < modd:#liferay> I also wonder if there are any news on having access to non-public tickets and/or a EE dev license
12:12 < modd:#liferay> denissignoretto1: congrats on the new title ;)
12:14 <@jhf:#liferay> modd: were you authoring a blog post? because the forum post editor doesn't have this.
12:14 < modd:#liferay> yes
12:14 <@jhf:#liferay> also, doclib was disabled for general use due to security issues discovered last year. so yeah you can still upload files like images but other types I believe are not allowed and will fail.
12:14 < modd:#liferay> it's some kind of security issue so I thought it's a good idea to tell you
12:15 < modd:#liferay> didn't try anything else
12:15 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah.... people were uploading malicious .swf files and then sending links to them with XSS attacks in the URLs
12:15 < denissignoretto1:#liferay> thank you modd, 2013 has been a great year, I was at DevCon and it was a really powerful experience!
12:15 < modd:#liferay> but on the other hand, using it for such things like screenshots would be nice
12:15 < modd:#liferay> devcon? in berlin?
12:15 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah. it's possible in the blog editor but you can't get to a page with a document library portlet on it.
12:16 < modd:#liferay> but I can get the files via link
12:16 < denissignoretto1:#liferay> jhf and modd, about blog, I was able to upload small images
12:16 <@jhf:#liferay> yes, that's by design - for embedding images into your blog posts
12:16 < denissignoretto1:#liferay> yes modd, in Berlin
12:17 < modd:#liferay> well, I'm the bird-man^^
12:17 < modd:#liferay> (if you saw jhfs presentation)
12:18 < denissignoretto1:#liferay> modd, which one presentation, actually I don't remember now
12:19 < denissignoretto1:#liferay> modd, what's your profile on liferay web site ?
12:22 < modd:#liferay> http://www.liferay.com/web/james.falkner/blog/-/blogs/2013-liferay-community-pulse-awards?_33_redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.liferay.com%2Fweb%2Fjames.falkner%2Fblog%3Fp_p_id%3D33%26p_p_lifecycle%3D0%26p_p_state%3Dnormal%26p_p_mode%3Dview%26p_p_col_id%3Dcolumn-2%26p_p_col_count%3D1
12:27 < modd:#liferay> it's way better to have one of these than an official training^^
12:28 <@jhf:#liferay> hey modd what was the question about EE dev licenses and non-public tickets? you want access to LESA tickets even if you aren't working on an EE project (e.g. an independent developer)?
12:29 < modd:#liferay> well I often see things like "xy fixed in ticket z" but ticket z is private^^
12:29 < modd:#liferay> so yes, some kind of top contributor ticket access^^
12:30 < modd:#liferay> and dev ee license to do testings..currently I'm testing remote with the dev portal of a customer :\
12:30 < modd:#liferay> like with my last ticket from above
12:33 <@jhf:#liferay> hey modd so in that ticket (LPS-43932) it should be fixed in an upcoming service pack for 6.2. But it's not yet available.
12:33 <@jhf:#liferay> and which private ticket does your ticket reference?
12:33 < modd:#liferay> no, not this time
12:33 < modd:#liferay> some weeks ago, as I asked the first time for it, I had a ticket I couldn't check out
12:34 < modd:#liferay> and was like "owww :("
12:34 <@jhf:#liferay> ah. well I can surely ask, but I think it has little chance of success - there are issues around privacy (like, some customers may not want anyone but Liferay knowing that they use Liferay, in particular financial and government customers)
12:35 <@jhf:#liferay> in fact I don't think even EE subscribers get unfettered access to all private tickets
12:35 <@jhf:#liferay> just the ones they file
12:35 < modd:#liferay> but customers use lesa tickets
12:35 < modd:#liferay> I'm talking about tickets at issues.liferay.com, so jira tickets without customer context
12:36 < modd:#liferay> and a dev license would be great for testing/finding/fixing bugs
12:36 <@jhf:#liferay> most LPS tickets marked private are either a) security tickets (and you can volunteer to join the community security team to get access to those), or b) internal-use-only tickets like for internal QA processes, etc.
12:37 <@jhf:#liferay> hmm.. dev licenses I could probably do.
12:37 < modd:#liferay> yep. after patching these tickets it would be nice to see them
12:38 < modd:#liferay> lps tickets are hidden for eternity^^
12:38 <@jhf:#liferay> security tickets are *supposed* to be un-hidden (and sanitized) after the issue is resolved for customers.
12:38 <@jhf:#liferay> but if they are not, you can email cst@liferay.com
12:38 <@jhf:#liferay> (community security team)
12:39 < modd:#liferay> but it doesn't happen always as it seems
12:39 < modd:#liferay> joining the team would be some kind of pointless, because I'm not able to test like 10 tickets a day^^
12:40 < modd:#liferay> so it wouldn't help the team
12:42 < modd:#liferay> and "dev licenses" isn't necessary "dev license" would do the trick ;)
12:42 < modd:#liferay> I think all top contributors could use these, so it would be some kind of give-back to the contributors
12:42 <@jhf:#liferay> heh yeah. that's not a problem. but, giving access to private tickets (other than security-related tickets) I'm afraid isn't going to be allowed.
12:43 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah, I think that all contributors should get a 1 year EE dev license. I'll see if that's doable (I think it will be).
12:43 <@jhf:#liferay> as reward for contribution!
12:43 < denissignoretto1:#liferay> hi guys, I left you, I'm goning to go back fighting the error "accessDeclaredMembers : Access denied (java.lang.RuntimePermission accessDeclaredMembers)" even though in liferay was.policy ear file I explicity added "permission java.lang.RuntimePermission "accessDeclaredMembers"; and permission java.security.AllPermission;" :( (sysadmin will never enable security on all server profile like in docs)
12:43 < modd:#liferay> but after a private LPS ticket was fixed it'S supposed to be non-private...
12:44 < modd:#liferay> ..with option to extend^^
12:44 <@jhf:#liferay> if it was security-related, yes. but there might be other reasons. in any case, the code fix itself is open.
12:45 < modd:#liferay> active testing won't end after 1 year ;)
12:47 < modd:#liferay> testing both CE and EE is a good idea because it might be fixed already in EE, so one can mention in the ticket, that it wasn't reproducible in EE but in CE...
12:48 < modd:#liferay> maybe even find the patch note in EE patches
12:48 < modd:#liferay> or if it's a problem in both versions it's a good informatino for lr to fix it for the customers
12:50 < modd:#liferay> I don't need access to lesa tickets in such cases but I can mark the ticket as private/security, if it's an issue in EE, too
12:50 < modd:#liferay> ..if it's security related of course
12:51 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah, that's always a good idea so would appreciate it if you mark it security (even if it's CE only bug)
12:53 <@jhf:#liferay> ok email sent re: dev licenses for top contributors
12:53 -!- mode/#liferay [+o jhf] by ChanServ
12:53 <@jhf:#liferay> whoops, wrong button
13:11 < modd:#liferay> jhf: cool, thanks!
16:39 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, do you happen to know off the top of your head how you get the current url in a VM template?
16:40 <@jhf:#liferay> $request.attributes.CURRENT_URL ?
16:42 < jardineworks:#liferay> @(*&$! -- but remember I have the issue where my $request object is empty!
16:44 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> jardineworks: Theme oder journal template?
16:44 < jardineworks:#liferay> journal template
16:45 <@jhf:#liferay> well.. without the request object.. I don't see how you could get it, except with client-side javascript / window.location kind of stuff
16:46 <@jhf:#liferay> can you call services like *LocalServiceUtil and PortalUtil.* ?
16:46 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Velocity provides a LinkTool that has getURI().
16:46 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Is that available in journal templates?
16:46 <@jhf:#liferay> we do insert *some* VelocityTools
16:46 <@jhf:#liferay> dunno if we have a linkTool though.. checking
16:47 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I don't have a Liferay at hand to test.
16:47 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Already started into the weekend. ;)
16:47 <@jhf:#liferay> jardineworks: can you get to portalUtil ?
16:48 <@jhf:#liferay> if so you may be able to get what you need via http://docs.liferay.com/portal/6.1/javadocs/com/liferay/portal/util/PortalUtil.html
16:49 <@jhf:#liferay> but somehow I think you'll need the request
16:51 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> We noticed something very odd today in our Liferay btw...we have staging and versioning enabled...and we had the problem that articles didn't get published.
16:51 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Turns out that they actually got published, but Web Content Display always shows the most recent version of an article.
16:51 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> And we actually found in the DB that the max version of most articles was lower on live than on staging.
16:52 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> => Publishing lead to an overwrite of an older version on live and thus the change didn't show.
16:52 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Is that by any chance a known issue?
16:54 <@jhf:#liferay> haven't heard of that one Tar-Minyatur
16:54 <@jhf:#liferay> search issues.liferay.com ?
16:55 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I took a quick look and didn't find anything.
16:55 < jardineworks:#liferay> sorry guys
16:55 < jardineworks:#liferay> new issue
16:55 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Couldn't spend much time though.
16:55 < jardineworks:#liferay> I would love to know how to get JournalContentUtil.getDisplay(themeDisplay.getScopeGroupId(),
16:55 < jardineworks:#liferay> 																articleId,
16:55 < jardineworks:#liferay> 																templateId,
16:55 < jardineworks:#liferay> 																PortletMode.VIEW.toString(),
16:55 < jardineworks:#liferay> 																themeDisplay.getLanguageId(), 																
16:55 < jardineworks:#liferay> 																themeDisplay,
16:55 < jardineworks:#liferay> 																1,
16:55 < jardineworks:#liferay> 																article.getContent()
16:55 < jardineworks:#liferay> 															);
16:55 < jardineworks:#liferay> to return something other than null.
16:55 < jardineworks:#liferay> is xmlRequest basically the content for the journal article?
