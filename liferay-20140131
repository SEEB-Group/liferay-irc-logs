03:04 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> has anyone used liferay 6,2 GA1?
03:28 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> the liferay 6.2 is noticeably slower. does anyone know why it is so?
06:04 < Krugger:#liferay> hi, just got an old 5.2 liferay portal under my care and would like to upgrade it to the latest 6.2. Is there an upgrade guide? Still reading through the documentation, but haven't seen an update chapter yet.
06:24 < modd_:#liferay> hi rotty3000, I've created a ticket for my problem I mentioned last time: LPS-43932 (the formating is a bit wrong but I can't edit it anymore :\)
06:24 < modd_:#liferay> Krugger: yep, there's a upgrade guide
06:25 < Krugger:#liferay> but the upgrade instruction are just like decompress the new version and point it to your database, is it really that simple?
06:26 < Krugger:#liferay> I am thinking of testing it out in a VM before I destroy production
06:27 < modd_:#liferay> http://www.liferay.com/documentation/liferay-portal/6.2/user-guide/-/ai/upgrading-liferay-liferay-portal-6-2-user-guide-18-en
06:27 < modd_:#liferay> well, you shouldn't do it simply on your production db and data without backups
06:27 < modd_:#liferay> try it with a copied version first
06:35 < Krugger:#liferay> most people seem to have less problems with mysql than postgresql, so it seems it is a bad idea to change the database during this upgrade, right?
06:43 < modd_:#liferay> yes^^
08:46 < tom235321:#liferay> hello, last days I had problems with my Liferay Server. Its MySQL Backend has too many open connections, so liferay stop serving content. I am using hibernate without connection pools. Is it a known behavior?
09:33 -!- mode/#liferay [+o jhf] by ChanServ
10:19 < Krugger:#liferay> tom235321: I just got my hands on liferay so I have near zero experience in liferay, but I noticed you can control the amount of connection to the database in the portal-ext.properties file
10:37 <@jhf:#liferay> hey denissignoretto1 - you there?
11:55 < denissignoretto1:#liferay> Hi jhf, yes! I'm there!!!
11:56 < denissignoretto1:#liferay> I'm struggling with websphere and Security !!! :) - and now I take a little rest
11:57 <@jhf:#liferay> ugh.. well sorry to hear that.. denis is one of our top contributors from Q4 2013, so *clap clap clap* for that. Also, I wanted to mention we will have the drawing for the big prize on this channel tomorrow, at 10am EST (4pm CET). So if you're here, you can see what you've won :)
11:58 <@jhf:#liferay> you don't have to be present to win, but it's fun !
11:58 <@jhf:#liferay> oh wait. tomorrow's saturday.
11:58 <@jhf:#liferay> hmm.. maybe we wait for monday.
12:03 < modd:#liferay> jhf: seems like users on liferay.com can't use the document library
12:04 <@jhf:#liferay> oh?
12:05 < modd:#liferay> the question is, is it because of security or why
12:05 <@jhf:#liferay> I think individual doclibs for users are no longer available. is that what you mean?
12:05 < modd:#liferay> yep
12:05 < denissignoretto1:#liferay> thanks, jhf... I was curoious about IRC, I wasn't used... it's my first time here!
12:05 < modd:#liferay> but I can still upload files^^
12:06 < modd:#liferay> check my account, I've uploaded the screenshots for my problem with content sharing
12:07 < modd:#liferay> btw, new ticket: LPS-43932
12:07 < modd:#liferay> I can't edit my own tickets...again^^
12:07 <@jhf:#liferay> how did you upload the screenshots? via the wysiwyg editor? or your profile?
12:07 < modd:#liferay> the editor^^
12:09 < modd:#liferay> I also wonder if there are any news on having access to non-public tickets and/or a EE dev license
12:12 < modd:#liferay> denissignoretto1: congrats on the new title ;)
12:14 <@jhf:#liferay> modd: were you authoring a blog post? because the forum post editor doesn't have this.
12:14 < modd:#liferay> yes
12:14 <@jhf:#liferay> also, doclib was disabled for general use due to security issues discovered last year. so yeah you can still upload files like images but other types I believe are not allowed and will fail.
12:14 < modd:#liferay> it's some kind of security issue so I thought it's a good idea to tell you
