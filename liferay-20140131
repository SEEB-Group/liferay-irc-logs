03:04 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> has anyone used liferay 6,2 GA1?
03:28 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> the liferay 6.2 is noticeably slower. does anyone know why it is so?
06:04 < Krugger:#liferay> hi, just got an old 5.2 liferay portal under my care and would like to upgrade it to the latest 6.2. Is there an upgrade guide? Still reading through the documentation, but haven't seen an update chapter yet.
06:24 < modd_:#liferay> hi rotty3000, I've created a ticket for my problem I mentioned last time: LPS-43932 (the formating is a bit wrong but I can't edit it anymore :\)
06:24 < modd_:#liferay> Krugger: yep, there's a upgrade guide
06:25 < Krugger:#liferay> but the upgrade instruction are just like decompress the new version and point it to your database, is it really that simple?
06:26 < Krugger:#liferay> I am thinking of testing it out in a VM before I destroy production

06:27 < modd_:#liferay> well, you shouldn't do it simply on your production db and data without backups
06:27 < modd_:#liferay> try it with a copied version first
06:35 < Krugger:#liferay> most people seem to have less problems with mysql than postgresql, so it seems it is a bad idea to change the database during this upgrade, right?
06:43 < modd_:#liferay> yes^^
08:46 < tom235321:#liferay> hello, last days I had problems with my Liferay Server. Its MySQL Backend has too many open connections, so liferay stop serving content. I am using hibernate without connection pools. Is it a known behavior?

10:19 < Krugger:#liferay> tom235321: I just got my hands on liferay so I have near zero experience in liferay, but I noticed you can control the amount of connection to the database in the portal-ext.properties file
10:37 <@jhf:#liferay> hey denissignoretto1 - you there?
