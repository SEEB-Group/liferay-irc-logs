04:47 < Axxell> Hey guys, i want to create a hook for a the web form portlet, but in liferay 6.2 the web form portlet is obtained from the app store, how do i create a hook for that portlet?
05:31 < Axxell> ok, apparently i need to make my own version? downloaded from svn the web forms portlet, trying to convert it to a liferay project, i can import it to eclipse, but can not convert it to a liferay portlet
05:37 < Axxell> Anybody how do i import a portlet from http://svn.liferay.com/repos/public/plugins/branches/6.1.x/portlets/web-form-portlet/ into eclipse and make it a liferayproject?
05:37 < Axxell> this guide is not helping: https://www.liferay.com/community/wiki/-/wiki/Main/Liferay+IDE+Importing+Existing+Projects
05:48 < Axxell> Anybody?
05:48 < Axxell> Is there any guide how to customize a portlet like the web-form portlet
05:49 < Axxell> cant import it into eclipse in any form
07:08 < topolik> Axxell: When I need sth like this I just copy the downloaded project into standard Plugins SDK folder structure
07:08 < Axxell> yup but it still just wont make itself a liferay project?
07:09 < Axxell> and has a lot of stuff that hinders it from compiling
07:14 < Axxell> ok seems like i might get it to work
