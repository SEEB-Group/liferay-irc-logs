08:06 < Yam`:#liferay> hi
08:09 < Yam`:#liferay> I want to create a new theme with a custom css to change some colors and stuff but I created a theme and it looks like it's broken, being all black and ugly: http://i.imgur.com/y6DRyl6.png instead of the classic theme: http://i.imgur.com/2FArVG1.png
08:10 < Yam`:#liferay> Someone knows what I may have done wrong? (or not done)
08:27 < winem_:#liferay> hi. is there any way to tell liferay to refer domain/custom/some-more.css instead of domain:8080/custom/some-more.css when the jboss is listening on port 8080?
09:04 < jardineworks_:#liferay> winem_, Where are you adding the css? is this in a portlet or in a theme?
10:34 < winem_:#liferay> very good question, I'm just the admin... let me ask my web developer :)
10:37 < winem_:#liferay> looks like the issue has been fixed by a new parameter in the apache config.. actually, I just get two requests with the domain of the liferay-server in the background as remote and not the webproxy
10:38 < winem_:#liferay> I get an error like "com.liferay.portal.kernel.repository.RepositoryException: No Repository exists with the primary key 10181" in both cases in the log from liferay. so I guess it's a broken reference and a task for our developers
10:39 < winem_:#liferay> will come back to you if it occures again. :-)
10:40 < jardineworks_:#liferay> sure
11:26 < winem_:#liferay> jardineworks_: I have another question.
11:28 < winem_:#liferay> we have an apache as proxy and liferay as backend server. mod_proxy works fine. but now, when I access the website and take a look at the page source it references a lot of resources via 192.168.10.159:8080/css/etc...
11:29 < winem_:#liferay> I'm not an expert in web design, but does this mean that the backend server itself loads the ressources from this IP or does the client also initiate a request to this ip.. this will not work on a public website...
11:30 < jardineworks_:#liferay> winem_, no, but liferay supplies all links with the host and port it receives in the request.
11:30 < jardineworks_:#liferay> it builds FULL urls.
11:31 < jardineworks_:#liferay> so you need to proxy pass the domain name you want to appear in the link
11:31 < jardineworks_:#liferay> are you guys using a multi-instance setup? or a single instance? (Portal Instances -- as in the control panel)
11:31 < winem_:#liferay> ok, this should also be possible with a proxypassreservehost parameter in the apache config I think...
11:32 < jardineworks_:#liferay> winem_, just remember that the host will be in the body of the content. This full link shenanigans is a pain in my pass right now and we might end up using a third part module to search and replace the response body content.
11:38 < winem_:#liferay> ok, what do you recommend?
11:39 < Yam`:#liferay> jardineworks_, is there a liferay util to download pictures via fileInputStream?
11:39 < jardineworks_:#liferay> winem_, single instance or multiple?
11:39 < winem_:#liferay> and to answer your question: at the moment, we use liferay for exactly one website (with responsive full page design) as cms. but we want to use this as general CMS for all our customers and all new projects with a website
11:40 < winem_:#liferay> single instance means single host / application server?
11:41 < jardineworks_:#liferay> winem_, the nomeclature can be confusion. YOu have a single INSTALLATION of liferay on a server. When you install it, the installation process creates an "instance" .. the default instance. The Default instance, let's say, is configured to "liferay.com" ... so when you send a request to the server, if it can't match the host you provide, it just sends you to the default instance.
11:41 < jardineworks_:#liferay> now, IN THE DEFAULT instance control panel...
11:42 < jardineworks_:#liferay> there is a "Portal Instances" link
11:42 < winem_:#liferay> ok, so it's actually a single instance setup
11:42 < jardineworks_:#liferay> there you can add additional instances (mapped to Company object in database and API) ... where you specify a virtual host.
11:42 < winem_:#liferay> now I know what you mean by instance..
11:42 < jardineworks_:#liferay> so if you create a new instance called winem.com ... then later on requests that go to winmen.com get routed to that second instance.
11:43 < jardineworks_:#liferay> so ... the easiest solution
11:43 < jardineworks_:#liferay> you have domain a.com ... create a new instance called a.com .. and in apache ProxyPreserveHost On so that all the links that come back contain a.com for the host.
11:45 < winem_:#liferay> ok, so the apache config will contain: ProxyPreserveHost On, ProxyPass / http://192.168.10.159:8080/web/aye/welcome, ProxyPassReverse / http://192.168.10.159:8080/web/aye/welcome
11:46 < winem_:#liferay> let me take a look at the backend and try to create / map the instances
11:46 < jardineworks_:#liferay> winem_, right
11:46 < winem_:#liferay> ok. then I got it - I think..
11:46 < jardineworks_:#liferay> but if you send in winem.com ... then what Liferay actually gets is winem.com:8080/web/aye/welcom
11:48 < winem_:#liferay> this gets liferay when?
11:49 < jardineworks_:#liferay> winem_, after apache passes it off
11:49 < jardineworks_:#liferay> I just mean the host you specify for the pass doesn't matter because it will preserve whatever came into apache
11:53 < winem_:#liferay> ok
11:53 < winem_:#liferay> but this is as expected
11:54 < winem_:#liferay> other domains will get their own apache instance on our mass vhost webserver. and this would also work if I create a new instance for the new domain, right?
11:56 < jardineworks_:#liferay> yeah
