08:06 < Yam`:#liferay> hi
08:09 < Yam`:#liferay> I want to create a new theme with a custom css to change some colors and stuff but I created a theme and it looks like it's broken, being all black and ugly: http://i.imgur.com/y6DRyl6.png instead of the classic theme: http://i.imgur.com/2FArVG1.png
08:10 < Yam`:#liferay> Someone knows what I may have done wrong? (or not done)
08:27 < winem_:#liferay> hi. is there any way to tell liferay to refer domain/custom/some-more.css instead of domain:8080/custom/some-more.css when the jboss is listening on port 8080?
09:04 < jardineworks_:#liferay> winem_, Where are you adding the css? is this in a portlet or in a theme?
10:34 < winem_:#liferay> very good question, I'm just the admin... let me ask my web developer :)
10:37 < winem_:#liferay> looks like the issue has been fixed by a new parameter in the apache config.. actually, I just get two requests with the domain of the liferay-server in the background as remote and not the webproxy
10:38 < winem_:#liferay> I get an error like "com.liferay.portal.kernel.repository.RepositoryException: No Repository exists with the primary key 10181" in both cases in the log from liferay. so I guess it's a broken reference and a task for our developers
10:39 < winem_:#liferay> will come back to you if it occures again. :-)
10:40 < jardineworks_:#liferay> sure
11:26 < winem_:#liferay> jardineworks_: I have another question.
11:28 < winem_:#liferay> we have an apache as proxy and liferay as backend server. mod_proxy works fine. but now, when I access the website and take a look at the page source it references a lot of resources via 192.168.10.159:8080/css/etc...
11:29 < winem_:#liferay> I'm not an expert in web design, but does this mean that the backend server itself loads the ressources from this IP or does the client also initiate a request to this ip.. this will not work on a public website...
11:30 < jardineworks_:#liferay> winem_, no, but liferay supplies all links with the host and port it receives in the request.
11:30 < jardineworks_:#liferay> it builds FULL urls.
