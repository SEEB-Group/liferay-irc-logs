08:06 < Yam`:#liferay> hi
08:09 < Yam`:#liferay> I want to create a new theme with a custom css to change some colors and stuff but I created a theme and it looks like it's broken, being all black and ugly: http://i.imgur.com/y6DRyl6.png instead of the classic theme: http://i.imgur.com/2FArVG1.png
08:10 < Yam`:#liferay> Someone knows what I may have done wrong? (or not done)
08:27 < winem_:#liferay> hi. is there any way to tell liferay to refer domain/custom/some-more.css instead of domain:8080/custom/some-more.css when the jboss is listening on port 8080?
09:04 < jardineworks_:#liferay> winem_, Where are you adding the css? is this in a portlet or in a theme?
10:34 < winem_:#liferay> very good question, I'm just the admin... let me ask my web developer :)
10:37 < winem_:#liferay> looks like the issue has been fixed by a new parameter in the apache config.. actually, I just get two requests with the domain of the liferay-server in the background as remote and not the webproxy
