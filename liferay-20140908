08:06 < Yam`:#liferay> hi
08:09 < Yam`:#liferay> I want to create a new theme with a custom css to change some colors and stuff but I created a theme and it looks like it's broken, being all black and ugly: http://i.imgur.com/y6DRyl6.png instead of the classic theme: http://i.imgur.com/2FArVG1.png
08:10 < Yam`:#liferay> Someone knows what I may have done wrong? (or not done)
