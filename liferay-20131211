04:53 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I really hate the publishing stuff. It's broken. It's just broken.
04:53 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I think we would be way better of if we created some kind of staging system ourselves instead of relying on the Liferay stuff...
04:53 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Problems upon problems. I'm so tired of it.
05:08 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Honestly...some web content goes live without being published...some pages are not publishable, because every attempt end in an error message.
06:48 < hufg:#liferay> :(
06:49 < hufg:#liferay> yes it's a paaain
06:49 < hufg:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur: the default here is to implement your own publishing
06:49 < hufg:#liferay> but it costs a lot and needs a lot of testing
06:50 < hufg:#liferay> the problem is that even with like 99% reliability you will end up in situations where you need to recover from publishing failures
06:51 < hufg:#liferay> have you modified liferay src?
06:51 < hufg:#liferay> and which staging implementation
06:51 < hufg:#liferay> in GA2 local publishing has worked fairly well
06:51 < hufg:#liferay> so far
06:55 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> We are on the latest 6.1.2
06:55 < hufg:#liferay> remote publish?
06:55 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> But we migrated a DB from 6.1.0 and I'm starting to get the feeling that we also copied some bad states.
06:55 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> No. Local publishing.
06:55 < hufg:#liferay> ;-D
06:55 < hufg:#liferay> so you made an upgrade
06:55 < hufg:#liferay> good luck with that
06:56 < hufg:#liferay> your documentlibrary will be incompatible
06:56 < hufg:#liferay> and that's a fact
06:56 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> That would be ok, I think...because we have next to nothing in there.
06:57 < hufg:#liferay> hehe ok
06:57 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> But that's a good point.
06:57 < hufg:#liferay> butt next to nothing can destroy your publishing
06:57 < hufg:#liferay> as in a showstopper
06:57 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I just saw some kind of S3 error in the log after getting a publishing error.
06:57 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> What's the approach here? Remove everything from the DL?
06:58 < hufg:#liferay> the only way to make a liferay upgrade is to 1) get some 150k in cash and army of consultants 2) pray for a miracle 3) clear some 6 months of your calendar and pray for a miracle
06:58 < hufg:#liferay> not sure haven't looked into it
06:58 < hufg:#liferay> but yes to wipe out(not migrate) the dl
06:58 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> *sigh* Couldn't you have told me that 3 months ago? :-/
06:59 < hufg:#liferay> :(
06:59 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> So far the content migration has worked quite well.
06:59 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> But apparently the publishing is messed up now.
06:59 < hufg:#liferay> yes yes that's the problem you will end up with broken features and what not and it's impossible to test
06:59 < hufg:#liferay> what's the error?
07:00 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> 11:46:43,957 ERROR [ajp-bio-8009-exec-3][render_portlet_jsp:157] com.liferay.portal.kernel.lar.PortletDataException: com.liferay.portal.kernel.exception.SystemException: org.jets3t.service.S3ServiceException: S3 Error Message. -- ResponseCode: 404, ResponseStatus: Not Found
07:00 < hufg:#liferay> mm no idea
07:00 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I always have a bad feeling, when files are stored somewhere and tracked in a database.
07:00 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> This just has to get out of sync at some point.
07:01 < hufg:#liferay> personally i would look into this satanic spawn of mutated migration where you read the to be migrated data with liferay api, generate your choice of data structure of it and read it back into fresh updated install through liferay api
07:01 < hufg:#liferay> i have absolutely no clue if this is feasible
07:01 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Liferay even has a verification process in the upgrade mechanism for the entire DL...unfortunately that's incredibly slow, because it does loads of requests to the S3 bucket.
07:01 < hufg:#liferay> the verification is bullshit
07:02 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Somehow it sounds like a lot of Liferay is bullshit.
07:02 < hufg:#liferay> bottom line upgrade is really hard, a pain in the ass to test and you need to do a lot of praying
07:02 < hufg:#liferay> no no you just have to know which part
07:02 < hufg:#liferay> parts
07:02 < hufg:#liferay> :(
07:02 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> But there is no way of finding our what's broken.
07:02 < hufg:#liferay> yes it's too complex
07:02 < hufg:#liferay> you can sometimes fix something
