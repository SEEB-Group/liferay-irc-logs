04:53 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I really hate the publishing stuff. It's broken. It's just broken.
04:53 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I think we would be way better of if we created some kind of staging system ourselves instead of relying on the Liferay stuff...
04:53 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Problems upon problems. I'm so tired of it.
05:08 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Honestly...some web content goes live without being published...some pages are not publishable, because every attempt end in an error message.
06:48 < hufg:#liferay> :(
06:49 < hufg:#liferay> yes it's a paaain
06:49 < hufg:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur: the default here is to implement your own publishing
06:49 < hufg:#liferay> but it costs a lot and needs a lot of testing
06:50 < hufg:#liferay> the problem is that even with like 99% reliability you will end up in situations where you need to recover from publishing failures
06:51 < hufg:#liferay> have you modified liferay src?
06:51 < hufg:#liferay> and which staging implementation
06:51 < hufg:#liferay> in GA2 local publishing has worked fairly well
06:51 < hufg:#liferay> so far
06:55 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> We are on the latest 6.1.2
06:55 < hufg:#liferay> remote publish?
06:55 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> But we migrated a DB from 6.1.0 and I'm starting to get the feeling that we also copied some bad states.
06:55 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> No. Local publishing.
06:55 < hufg:#liferay> ;-D
06:55 < hufg:#liferay> so you made an upgrade
06:55 < hufg:#liferay> good luck with that
06:56 < hufg:#liferay> your documentlibrary will be incompatible
06:56 < hufg:#liferay> and that's a fact
06:56 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> That would be ok, I think...because we have next to nothing in there.
06:57 < hufg:#liferay> hehe ok
06:57 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> But that's a good point.
06:57 < hufg:#liferay> butt next to nothing can destroy your publishing
06:57 < hufg:#liferay> as in a showstopper
06:57 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I just saw some kind of S3 error in the log after getting a publishing error.
06:57 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> What's the approach here? Remove everything from the DL?
06:58 < hufg:#liferay> the only way to make a liferay upgrade is to 1) get some 150k in cash and army of consultants 2) pray for a miracle 3) clear some 6 months of your calendar and pray for a miracle
06:58 < hufg:#liferay> not sure haven't looked into it
06:58 < hufg:#liferay> but yes to wipe out(not migrate) the dl
06:58 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> *sigh* Couldn't you have told me that 3 months ago? :-/
06:59 < hufg:#liferay> :(
06:59 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> So far the content migration has worked quite well.
06:59 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> But apparently the publishing is messed up now.
06:59 < hufg:#liferay> yes yes that's the problem you will end up with broken features and what not and it's impossible to test
06:59 < hufg:#liferay> what's the error?
