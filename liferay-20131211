04:53 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I really hate the publishing stuff. It's broken. It's just broken.
04:53 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I think we would be way better of if we created some kind of staging system ourselves instead of relying on the Liferay stuff...
04:53 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Problems upon problems. I'm so tired of it.
05:08 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Honestly...some web content goes live without being published...some pages are not publishable, because every attempt end in an error message.
06:48 < hufg:#liferay> :(
06:49 < hufg:#liferay> yes it's a paaain
06:49 < hufg:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur: the default here is to implement your own publishing
06:49 < hufg:#liferay> but it costs a lot and needs a lot of testing
06:50 < hufg:#liferay> the problem is that even with like 99% reliability you will end up in situations where you need to recover from publishing failures
06:51 < hufg:#liferay> have you modified liferay src?
06:51 < hufg:#liferay> and which staging implementation
06:51 < hufg:#liferay> in GA2 local publishing has worked fairly well
06:51 < hufg:#liferay> so far
