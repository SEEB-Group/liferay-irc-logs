00:18 < Rajesh:#liferay> hi friends
00:18 < Guest93824:#liferay> can you plese tell me folder hirarchy in liferay eclips?
04:41 < hufg:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur: did you find out the image thing?
04:42 < hufg:#liferay> it's curious that the image gallery still exists in some form but is mostly unaccessable
04:43 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> hufg: I didn't have time to dig into it. From what I've seen it looked like the stuff in stored in the DL.
04:44 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> And where else should it be stored anyway without breaking down entirely if a Liferay cluster is being used.
04:49 < hufg:#liferay> in db
04:49 < hufg:#liferay> dl and db are not the same thing
04:51 < hufg:#liferay> although if you are concerned about the cluster it probably doesn't matter
04:51 < hufg:#liferay> i'm more interested in performance
05:00 < hufg:#liferay> some 500ms retrieval from dl is alright but zz pzz 8)
