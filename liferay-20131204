00:18 < Rajesh:#liferay> hi friends
00:18 < Guest93824:#liferay> can you plese tell me folder hirarchy in liferay eclips?
04:41 < hufg:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur: did you find out the image thing?
04:42 < hufg:#liferay> it's curious that the image gallery still exists in some form but is mostly unaccessable
04:43 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> hufg: I didn't have time to dig into it. From what I've seen it looked like the stuff in stored in the DL.
04:44 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> And where else should it be stored anyway without breaking down entirely if a Liferay cluster is being used.
04:49 < hufg:#liferay> in db
04:49 < hufg:#liferay> dl and db are not the same thing
04:51 < hufg:#liferay> although if you are concerned about the cluster it probably doesn't matter
04:51 < hufg:#liferay> i'm more interested in performance
05:00 < hufg:#liferay> some 500ms retrieval from dl is alright but zz pzz 8)
05:07 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Yes. That's true.
05:07 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I'm not a big fan of storing images in the DB.
05:07 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Damn it. I definitely have too much stuff to do at the moment.
05:08 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I really could use a colleague to share the work and to have somebody for discussions. -.-
05:11 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Quick question: What happens to articles when I change the structure the article has been built with?
05:18 < hufg:#liferay> imo you have to support the previous structure
05:18 < hufg:#liferay> ie. only additions
05:19 < hufg:#liferay> i have tested it a long long time ago
05:19 < hufg:#liferay> the reason i'm saying is that structures have no versioning ie. a certain structure cannot be tarcked to certain article id
05:20 < hufg:#liferay> it probably tries to fill the structure values how it can
05:21 < hufg:#liferay> so if you remove or add stuff to structure it's just some extra stuff in db and nothing actually happens
05:23 < hufg:#liferay> so forget that only additions statement hehe
05:23 < hufg:#liferay> removals, additions but no renaming
08:06 < hufg:#liferay> anyone having annoying deployment problems with 6.1 GA2 ? util libs and liferay tlds are not copied into the portlet
08:06 < hufg:#liferay> or theme
13:32 < scribe:#liferay> Hi guys.  Any reports on the general state of 6.2GA1 CE?  We're reaching a point where we can realistically consider updating our system and wanted to hear if people are generally happy with 6.2 or if we should wait for a bug fix release?
13:40 < aj_:#liferay> scribe,  I haven't even had a chance to look at it yet but I am hoping too soon. Personally, I would wait for a big fix just to avoid being a beta tester :)
13:40 < aj_:#liferay> topolik, are you around?
14:22 < topolik:#liferay> aj: partly
14:23 < aj_:#liferay> partly enough to answer some questions? :)
14:36 < topolik:#liferay> if you don't need the answers instantly ;)
14:58 < aj_:#liferay> topolik, first question -- I have a custom attribute on my user. Its configured, and it works (I am using it) but when I go to the user and go to custom attributes, its not there?
15:19 < topolik:#liferay> aj_: did you create it with the default table? Isn't it hidden?
15:20 < aj_:#liferay> topolik, I set hidden to false.
15:20 < aj_:#liferay> I have another one for you :)
15:20 < aj_:#liferay> 		return getService()
15:20 < aj_:#liferay> 				   .addValue(companyId, className, tableName, columnName,
15:20 < aj_:#liferay> 			classPK, data);
15:21 < aj_:#liferay> if that returned a stack trace... could it be the result of databsase permissions
15:21 < aj_:#liferay> sorry -- stack trace is pretty vague hahah
15:22 < aj_:#liferay> 19:27:21,455 ERROR [ContainerBackgroundProcessor[StandardEngine[Catalina]]][ExpandoBridgeImpl:507] com.liferay.portal.security.auth.PrincipalException: PermissionChecker not initialized
