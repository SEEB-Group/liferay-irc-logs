05:45 < martin3k:#liferay> hi guys i am encountering a funny problem. starting up liferay using the wizard it connects seamless to the mysql database. all tables are created. after a restart of liferay it seems to dont connect to the database anymore (catalina.out: http://pastebin.com/UraECNCH) any ideas?
06:16 < nancy:#liferay> Hi how to remove welcome to liferay text from the header after logo?
06:23 < nancy:#liferay> Can anybody pls help me out?
06:37 < nancy:#liferay> Hi how to remove welcome to liferay text from the header after logo?
08:13 < Yam``:#liferay> jardineworks, I fixed my portal without reseting it so I'm ready to go on :)
08:13 < Yam``:#liferay> <jardineworks> from the tool bar on the side choose the + , then choose applications, find the YAM category and drag your portlet onto the pag
08:13 < Yam``:#liferay> e > done that, it works
09:14 < nancy:#liferay> Hi how to remove welcome to liferay text from the header after logo?
09:19 < jardineworks:#liferay> Yam``, ok -- now, in eclipse, under your project you will find docroot/view.jsp. Take you html (minus the <html><head> and <body> tags and paste it into there. You're basically taking the body contents for the page and putting them in the portlet.
10:09 < Yam``:#liferay> jardineworks, so how do I put the CSS and JS files?

11:21 < modd_:#liferay> I have a portlet which creates a user, a site using a template and assignes the user to the site and gives him site admin role. everything works fine except one problem: the site appears in the control panel but not in the my sites-navigation. checking the db it has pageCount=0. after clicking on the site in the backend (so it shows the site config) the site also appears in the my sites navigation
11:22 < modd_:#liferay> seems like it uses the template for the site but doesn't create the pages until I do some action on the site
11:22 < modd_:#liferay> am I missing some API call?
11:24 < modd_:#liferay> I tried GroupLocalServiceUtil.updateSite(group.getGroupId(), true); and LayoutSetLocalServiceUtil.updatePageCount(group.getGroupId(), false); but nothing helps so far
11:25 < jardineworks:#liferay> Yam``, put them in the css and js folders and then reference them with the path /js and /css
11:26 < Yam``:#liferay> just like in <head></head but without one?
11:26 < jardineworks:#liferay> right
11:26 < Yam``:#liferay> ok thx
11:27 < jardineworks:#liferay> Yam``, normally I try to put all my css and js in a theme-plugin, but for now, keep it simple :)
11:27 < Yam``:#liferay> I'll try that and if I don't have any problems I'll listen to your suggestions :)
11:27 < jardineworks:#liferay> haha
11:29 < Yam``:#liferay> fyi I removed the html folder in [liferay-portal]/[tomcat]/webapps/ROOT and copied the clean one from the archive to fix my dockbar issue
11:29 < Yam``:#liferay> (no loss in content/users or else)
11:30 < jardineworks:#liferay> ah -- good idea. I've had to do something similar before with individual files.
11:51 < Yam``:#liferay> when I pasted my code and copied my resources, what should I do jardineworks, double-clicking the project in the ant tab and if there are not erros I can use the portlet without restarting liferay?
11:52 < jardineworks:#liferay> Yam``, yep. tail -f tomcat_home/logs/catalina.out.... once you see messages that the portlet is deployed, refresh the page.
11:52 < Yam``:#liferay> ty jardineworks
