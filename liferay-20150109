07:48 < req-:#liferay> Learning Liferay here. I have a portal that used to use Hypersonic. I installed PostgreSQL now it's empty and I need the first admin user, how would I create that?
07:50 < req-:#liferay> Ach, the test user exists. Nevermind my question.
14:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey topolik you around?
14:05 < topolik:#liferay> hi jardineworks, a bit here a bit there :)
14:06 < jardineworks:#liferay> time for a quick SB question?
14:07 < jardineworks:#liferay> ... topolik and happy new year :)
14:08 < topolik:#liferay> ok
14:08 < topolik:#liferay> happy new year! :)
14:08 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik, I am of course breaking the mould as I usually do haha. I am (trying) using SB as a code gen, but I am not using a DB as my databsource. I have created a service.xml with two entities. Account and Product. In the business realm this is a one-to-many, so in my Account entity definition I have <column name="products" type="Collection" entity="Product"/>
14:08 < jardineworks:#liferay> I run the build-service
14:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> no errors.
14:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> but my Account model object does not have getters/setters for the product attribute
14:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> which I didn't expect.
14:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> is that normal?
14:14 < douglascrp:#liferay> jardineworks, I'm not sure it SB is supposed to deal with relationships
14:15 < douglascrp:#liferay> *if SB is...
14:15 < douglascrp:#liferay> jardineworks, if it does it, I'm really, really interested to know about it
14:17 < jardineworks:#liferay> douglascrp, I'm nto sure I follow. I have defined an attribute that maps to a List<?> for my model. In my case, I don't pull from a table -- but I do want the model that is generated to have an attribute List<Product> products; ... and then a getter/setter accordingly. Granted the population should be done through a mapping table, but at the very lest my definition should be there.
14:17 < jardineworks:#liferay> otherwise, what is the point of permitting "Collection" types?
14:18 < douglascrp:#liferay> jardineworks, that's what I want to know...lol
14:18 < douglascrp:#liferay> the option is there, but it seems it has nothing to create code to it
14:18 < douglascrp:#liferay> I think the code generator tool uses a freemarker template
14:18 < douglascrp:#liferay> is that right?
14:19 < douglascrp:#liferay> maybe looking at it should be a good idea to make sure it works
14:19 < douglascrp:#liferay> another place where you can use Collection types is on finders configuration
14:20 < douglascrp:#liferay> there you can define the type you want to return
14:20 < douglascrp:#liferay> but the relationship between entities have to be done by yourself
14:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> douglascrp, yeah, it uses freemarker.
14:21 < topolik:#liferay> jardineworks: I'm sorry, I don't know :( Haven't work with SB for too long :(
14:22 < jardineworks:#liferay> boo.
14:22 < topolik:#liferay> haha :D
14:22 < douglascrp:#liferay> jardineworks, https://www.liferay.com/pt/community/forums/-/message_boards/message/8196632
14:22 < douglascrp:#liferay> on that page, search for "After a long exploration in Liferay's forums and blogs, DTDs, etc.etc. I asked to Jignesh Gohel if they got a reply, obtaining the below comment:"
14:22 < douglascrp:#liferay> and then read the explanation
14:23 < douglascrp:#liferay> jardineworks, I don't know if you remember, but I'm new on Liferay world...
14:23 < douglascrp:#liferay> actually, you helped me a lot about 2 months ago
14:23 < douglascrp:#liferay> and being new, I can be completely wrong about my findings
