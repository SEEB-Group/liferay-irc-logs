07:48 < req-:#liferay> Learning Liferay here. I have a portal that used to use Hypersonic. I installed PostgreSQL now it's empty and I need the first admin user, how would I create that?
07:50 < req-:#liferay> Ach, the test user exists. Nevermind my question.
14:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey topolik you around?
14:05 < topolik:#liferay> hi jardineworks, a bit here a bit there :)
14:06 < jardineworks:#liferay> time for a quick SB question?
14:07 < jardineworks:#liferay> ... topolik and happy new year :)
14:08 < topolik:#liferay> ok
14:08 < topolik:#liferay> happy new year! :)
14:08 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik, I am of course breaking the mould as I usually do haha. I am (trying) using SB as a code gen, but I am not using a DB as my databsource. I have created a service.xml with two entities. Account and Product. In the business realm this is a one-to-many, so in my Account entity definition I have <column name="products" type="Collection" entity="Product"/>
14:08 < jardineworks:#liferay> I run the build-service
14:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> no errors.
14:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> but my Account model object does not have getters/setters for the product attribute
14:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> which I didn't expect.
14:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> is that normal?
14:14 < douglascrp:#liferay> jardineworks, I'm not sure it SB is supposed to deal with relationships
14:15 < douglascrp:#liferay> *if SB is...
