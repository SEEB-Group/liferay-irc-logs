09:39 <@jhf> hey everyone - if you’re here in 20 minutes you’ll be witness to an amazing thing that happens once every 3 months in the Liferay community
09:39 <@jhf> however, I will need a volunteer to help me out with it. it only takes 1 minute to be a volunteer.

09:42 <@jhf> where’s rotty3000 or bijoo or jardineworks or MagnoBooter or modd when u need em
09:54 < Peter_> Hi
09:54 < dnebing> Hey, Peter
09:55 < Peter_> Congrats with your nomination as well, David!
09:57 <@jhf> guys!!!! and dawn
09:58 < pmesotten> Hi James
09:58 <@jhf> hey Peter :)
09:58 <@jhf> so the way this works
09:58 <@jhf> I will write down a string that assigns each of you to a number
09:58 <@jhf> then I will hash that string and give you the SHA-1 hash of the string
09:58 <@jhf> then I will ask someone to pick a random number
09:59 <@jhf> whichever number is chosen is the winner, then I reveal the string to you (so that you can independently verify that was the right string from before)
09:59 <@jhf> the only way I can cheat is if I secretly tell the person who is picking the “random” number which number to pick
09:59 <@jhf> so you’ll have to have a bit of faith I won’t do that
09:59 < pmesotten> :-)
09:59 <@jhf> and yes, I realize this is totally overkill
09:59 <@jhf> :)
09:59 <@jhf> ok one sec..
10:00 <@jhf> kgolebiowski: !!!
10:01 < dawn> is there a range of # ?
10:01 <@jhf> yep
10:02 <@jhf> ok the hash of the string is b511ac9e522ebe688722151da33dac6b47b8d593
10:02 <@jhf> ok dawn, pick a number between 9 and 11
10:02 <@jhf> 9, 10, or 11
10:02 < dawn> 11
10:02 < pmesotten> please pick the right one ;)
10:02 <@jhf> ok the winner is…………………………………….
10:02 <@jhf> dang I have a conference call. be back in 45 minutes.
10:02 < pmesotten> :D
10:02 <@jhf> lol j/k
10:02 < dawn> :)
10:03 <@jhf> ok the winner is: kgolebiowski !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
10:03 <@jhf> echo -n 'Dave=9,Peter=10,KG=11 and this is some salt' | openssl sha1
10:03 <@jhf> that was the string
10:03 <@jhf> "Dave=9,Peter=10,KG=11 and this is some salt"
10:03 <@jhf> sorry pmesotten and dnebing
10:03 < pmesotten> congrats KG :)
10:03 <@jhf> however, you guys are all in the running for contributor of the year
10:03 <@jhf> (as is ACA-IT :) )
10:03 <@jhf> to be awarded at the end of October
10:03 < pmesotten> OK nice!
10:04 <@jhf> also, thanks to all of you for being valued members of our community - sometimes it’s hard to justify time spent on open source and “giving away knowledge"
10:04 <@jhf> and pmesotten I will see you in 3 weeks
10:04 <@jhf> unless the iBeacons app is rejected from the app store
10:04 <@jhf> then I will hang my head in shame and cry
10:04 < kgolebiowski> thanks, sorry for late answer. I'm on the mobile
10:04 <@jhf> kgolebiowski: you won!!
10:04 < pmesotten> :P let's pray
10:05 <@jhf> I’ll contact you via email
10:05 <@jhf> well I know the android app will make it :)
10:05 <@jhf> but apple is.. apple
