09:39 <@jhf> however, I will need a volunteer to help me out with it. it only takes 1 minute to be a volunteer.

09:42 <@jhf> *crickets*
09:42 <@jhf> where’s rotty3000 or bijoo or jardineworks or MagnoBooter or modd when u need em
09:54 < Peter_> Hi
09:54 < dnebing> Hey, Peter
09:55 < Peter_> Congrats with your nomination as well, David!
09:57 <@jhf> guys!!!! and dawn
09:58 < pmesotten> Hi James
09:58 <@jhf> hey Peter :)
09:58 <@jhf> so the way this works
09:58 <@jhf> I will write down a string that assigns each of you to a number
09:58 <@jhf> then I will hash that string and give you the SHA-1 hash of the string
09:58 <@jhf> then I will ask someone to pick a random number
09:59 <@jhf> whichever number is chosen is the winner, then I reveal the string to you (so that you can independently verify that was the right string from before)
09:59 <@jhf> the only way I can cheat is if I secretly tell the person who is picking the “random” number which number to pick
09:59 <@jhf> so you’ll have to have a bit of faith I won’t do that
09:59 < pmesotten> :-)
09:59 <@jhf> and yes, I realize this is totally overkill
09:59 <@jhf> :)
09:59 <@jhf> ok one sec..
10:00 <@jhf> kgolebiowski: !!!
10:01 < dawn> is there a range of # ?
10:01 <@jhf> yep
10:02 <@jhf> ok the hash of the string is b511ac9e522ebe688722151da33dac6b47b8d593
10:02 <@jhf> ok dawn, pick a number between 9 and 11
10:02 <@jhf> 9, 10, or 11
10:02 < dawn> 11
10:02 < pmesotten> please pick the right one ;)
10:02 <@jhf> ok the winner is…………………………………….
10:02 <@jhf> dang I have a conference call. be back in 45 minutes.
10:02 < pmesotten> :D
10:02 <@jhf> lol j/k
10:02 < dawn> :)
10:03 <@jhf> ok the winner is: kgolebiowski !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
10:03 <@jhf> echo -n 'Dave=9,Peter=10,KG=11 and this is some salt' | openssl sha1
10:03 <@jhf> that was the string
10:03 <@jhf> "Dave=9,Peter=10,KG=11 and this is some salt"
10:03 <@jhf> sorry pmesotten and dnebing
10:03 < pmesotten> congrats KG :)
10:03 <@jhf> however, you guys are all in the running for contributor of the year
10:03 <@jhf> (as is ACA-IT :) )
10:03 <@jhf> to be awarded at the end of October
10:03 < pmesotten> OK nice!
10:04 <@jhf> also, thanks to all of you for being valued members of our community - sometimes it’s hard to justify time spent on open source and “giving away knowledge"
10:04 <@jhf> and pmesotten I will see you in 3 weeks
10:04 <@jhf> unless the iBeacons app is rejected from the app store
10:04 <@jhf> then I will hang my head in shame and cry
10:04 < kgolebiowski> thanks, sorry for late answer. I'm on the mobile
10:04 <@jhf> kgolebiowski: you won!!
10:04 < pmesotten> :P let's pray
10:05 <@jhf> I’ll contact you via email
10:05 <@jhf> well I know the android app will make it :)
10:05 <@jhf> but apple is.. apple
10:05 < pmesotten> np, I have a droid, hehe
10:05 <@jhf> thanks dawn for picking
10:05 <@jhf> pmesotten: oh??
10:05 <@jhf> oh an actual droid
10:06 <@jhf> as in motorola?
10:06 < dawn> yw jhf
10:06 < pmesotten> sry, as in android :)
10:06 < pmesotten> htc one sv
10:06 <@jhf> oh reaaaaaallllly
10:06 < dnebing> you cannot take app rejection personally, james
10:06 < dnebing> happens to the best of folks
10:07 <@jhf> dnebing: well I’m batting 1000 right now with them
10:07 <@jhf> so I want to keep the undefeated crown
10:11 < kgolebiowski2> Hi
10:11 < kgolebiowski2> I'm back with another android irc client
10:12 < kgolebiowski2> In the previous one I couldn't scroll messages :(
10:12 <@jhf> kgolebiowski: oh, nice feature!
10:14 <@jhf> well you won
10:14 <@jhf> I’ll contact you via email
10:14 < kgolebiowski2> Yes maybe in enterprise version you can scroll down
10:14 <@jhf> btw dawn, for your issue yesterday - I could not reproduce that issue
10:14 <@jhf> I never got clickable arrows on 6.2.10 in the sort container
10:15 < dawn> jhf that is weird.
10:15 < dawn> are you running any patched on top of it
10:15 <@jhf> I just browsed around control panel looking for portlets that show search results in the search container
10:15 <@jhf> like the Users and Organizations
10:15 <@jhf> or Site Templates
10:15 <@jhf> did a search to return a search container
10:16 <@jhf> saw the headings were clickable, but not the arrows
10:16 <@jhf> are you using the search container in a custom portlet?
10:17 < dawn> wait. did you CE version?
10:17 < dawn> *use
10:17 <@jhf> no 6.2.10 EE
10:17 <@jhf> also tried 6.2 CE
10:17 <@jhf> AND looked at the source code where those arrows are generated
10:17 <@jhf> they are never imbued with clickability
10:17 <@jhf> so I’m a little confused how you got clickable arrows. can you screenshot it?
10:18 < dawn> Sure I can do that. I am under an impression that CE some how didn't have this feature.. LOL
10:20 <@jhf> here is the source code for CE that generates those arrows: https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/blob/master/portal-web/docroot/html/taglib/ui/search_iterator/page.jsp#L197
10:20 <@jhf> the EE source is identical
10:20 <@jhf> <span class="table-sort-indicator"></span>
10:20 <@jhf> all that does is generate the tiny arrows (either up, down, or up+down) as tiny images
10:21 <@jhf> and the css for that <span> is here: https://github.com/liferay/alloy-ui/search?q=table-sort-indicator&ref=cmdform
10:22 <@jhf> you can see all it is is an image
10:22 <@jhf> not clickable
10:24 < dawn> here is the image, not sure if it is visible. I have clicked the arrow on Type column. http://postimg.org/image/pkb618rvr/
10:25 <@jhf> ok that is the Roles portlet
10:25 <@jhf> I have the same portlet on 6.2.10 of course
10:25 <@jhf> and in mine, the arrows are not clickable
10:25 <@jhf> only the title (“Type”) is clickable
10:26 <@jhf> what browser are you using?
10:27 < dawn> Safari 7.0.3 and Firefox 28
10:27 < dawn> on Mac
10:27 <@jhf> and you are absolutely positive your arrows are clickable? because mine are not (Mac - tested with Safari, Chrome, and Firefox)
10:28 <@jhf> next I’m gonna try 7.0 master from last night. one sec.
10:28 < dawn> i am 100% positive on it
10:28 < dawn> remember I don't have any patches on top of base release
10:29 <@jhf> if it doesn’t work in master, then I am going to be highly perplexed
10:29 <@jhf> do you ahve any special browser settings? perhaps some accessibility thing set?
10:30 <@jhf> ah hah!
10:30 <@jhf> it works on master.
10:30 < dawn> there you go
10:31 <@jhf> let’s see who added that feature, and when..
10:31 <@jhf> still weird that it works on your 6.2.10 and not on mine.
10:31 <@jhf> are you sure you’re using 6.2.10 with no patches?
10:31 < dawn> okay wait..let me verify this patch thing
10:34 < dawn> looks like I have installed some path related to search
10:34 < dawn> here it is [*I] search-2-6210 :: Installed; Will be installed. :: Built for Liferay
10:47 <@jhf> ah hah!
10:47 <@jhf> found it: https://issues.liferay.com/browse/LPS-41270
10:47 <@jhf> so it was fixed in CE GA2 and EE
10:48 <@jhf> here’s the code change:
10:48 <@jhf> https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/commit/3bf656e8d61edf6d82f0af27ac55f9b16068f3ff#diff-47bf40504faab9684dd47035c66c33a1
10:48 <@jhf> it includes the arrows as part of the <a> link on the header
10:48 <@jhf> so there you go dawn
10:49 <@jhf> it’s fixed in a fixpack for EE 6.2.10
10:49 <@jhf> liferay-fixpack-platform-2-6210
10:50 <@jhf> so you probably have the “platform-2” patch installed
10:55 < dawn> now I get it
10:55 < dawn> thank you jhf
10:58 <@jhf> mine didn’t work cause I didn’t have any patches applied
10:58 < dawn> yes
13:26 <@jhf> anyone here speak french?
15:04 < jardineworks> jhf, I do. But its pretty rusty
15:06 <@jhf> ok, thanks - too late for now, I just used google translate :) I know it’s horrible but i’m in a hurry :)
15:07 < jardineworks> haha... been so long for me... that might actually be your better option
16:03 < bijoo_> just saw these messages, quite exciting! Congrats to kgolebiowski; and thanks jhf for the awesomeness.
