05:56 < Yam`:#liferay> hi
08:21 < Axxell:#liferay> Hey guys trying to ad to liferay 6.2 web content listing the ability to sort articles by title but i cant get it to work
08:21 < Axxell:#liferay> any clues?
08:31 < Axxell:#liferay> the error i get is: 12:17:15,247 ERROR [http-bio-8080-exec-7][JDBCExceptionReporter:82] Unknown column 'title' in 'order clause'
08:31 < Axxell:#liferay> older versions used the "title" column as a orderbycol
08:40 < Axxell:#liferay> i can sort by urlTitle but that doesnt help much
08:42 < Yam`:#liferay> Has somebody ever exported lportal base in an other computer and faced issues with groups?

09:28 < jardineworks_:#liferay> topolik, you around?
09:35 < Urug_:#liferay> I have got finished Liferay application running on single machine using bundled Tomcat server and MySQL db. Everything is setup as default. My task is to create another server instance which is going to be one-to-one replica of the existing one working as backup server. So these servers must be always sychronized. I've got zero experience with clustering or replicating. I am looking for any advice, direction or general information how t
09:37 < jardineworks_:#liferay> Urug_, Liferay clustering is easy. If you support multicast it is even easier. One minute, I think I have the instructions written down.
09:38 < jardineworks_:#liferay> Urug_, in your portal-ext -- add the following
09:38 < jardineworks_:#liferay> cluster.link.enabled=true
09:38 < jardineworks_:#liferay> cluster.link.autodetect.address=<some-address>:<some-port>
09:38 < jardineworks_:#liferay> lucene.replicate.write=true
09:39 < jardineworks_:#liferay> for the address and port, I think I used my database ip and 3306 (for MySQL)
09:39 < jardineworks_:#liferay> that will allow the ehcache and search index to remain in synch
09:40 < jardineworks_:#liferay> but if your setup is active passive, meaning the "backup instance" is never used unless the first instance goes down then you might not even need clustering. Clustering is only really necessary when both nodes are serving requests. If the backup only kicks in when the other node is down, it might be enough for them simply to be connected to the same database
09:40 < Yam`:#liferay> Is there a property file or something that links the usergroups to the portal?
09:41 < jardineworks_:#liferay> Yam`, the user groups that are created in the portal? or external user groups?
09:41 < Yam`:#liferay> jardineworks_, the user groups created in the portal
09:42 < Yam`:#liferay> because I've created user groups in the portal and exported the lportal database to another computer, I've got the user groups in the database but they are not displayed in the portal
09:42 < Yam`:#liferay> "no user groups were found"
09:43 < jardineworks_:#liferay> Yam`, go to the Server Administration .. clear the caches, and rebuild the serach indices.
09:43 < jardineworks_:#liferay> the user groups are created with in a portal instance (companyId) so exporting the database in its entirety will move everything -- or at least it should
09:44 < Yam`:#liferay> jardineworks_, the database cache ?
09:44 < Yam`:#liferay> or all of them ?
09:44 < jardineworks_:#liferay> Yam`, anything that is in that page
09:45 < jardineworks_:#liferay> the worst that will happen is that the site will be slow for a minute while that stuff is rebuilt.
09:45 < Yam`:#liferay> ok thanks
09:45 < jardineworks_:#liferay> Yam`, lemme know if that helps or not
09:48 < Yam`:#liferay> It worked, thanks jardineworks_, I've been struggling with this for half a day haha
09:48 < jardineworks_:#liferay> Yam`, I think I spent about half a day on it the first time I tried to solve that one :)
09:50 < Yam`:#liferay> Same here haha
09:55 < Urug_:#liferay> So it should be only about running another Liferay server and changing a Liferay configuration little bit. I mean I don't have to deal with some configuration out of Liferay sandbox.
09:56 < Urug_:#liferay> What about existing data are they going to be replicated?
09:56 < Urug_:#liferay> And what about liferay repository (files and documents)?
09:57 < jardineworks_:#liferay> Urug_, are you sharing the same database between both nodes?
09:59 < Urug_:#liferay> I quess they should be separated so  one of them can really work as backup.
09:59 < jardineworks_:#liferay> ah
09:59 < jardineworks_:#liferay> Urug_, ok so that is a different story. That sounds more like you are setting up a DR (disaster recovery)
10:00 < jardineworks_:#liferay> Which is not really a situation for clustering
10:05 < Urug_:#liferay> That's probably more appropriate term I quess, but basically two liferay instaces running in cluster could work the same way if active passive setup is not requierement, couldn't they?
10:07 < Urug_:#liferay> The requierement is to have access to application with all data up to date if one fo the erver will fail.
10:07 < Urug_:#liferay> *one of the servers
10:09 < jardineworks_:#liferay> Urug_, In that case an active passive cluster can be configured. Clearly you need at least 2 Liferay servers, but is the requirement also to have 2 database servers (also in active passive mode)?
10:10 < jardineworks_:#liferay> If so, then you probably has a proxy to the LR servers ... say server .200 that routes requests to 201, and 202. Both those servers would be configured for a secondary proxy (say 210) that would route requests to 211, 212 -- each being a datsabase. So you would handle the liferay clustering on 201 and 202 (using the stuff above), and you would configure MySQL (check their docs) to be clustered as well
10:11 < jardineworks_:#liferay> the proxy load balancer algorithm would basically always route traffic to 201 unless the health check failed, in which case it would send the request to 202. But you leave that control to the proxy
10:12 < jardineworks_:#liferay> 202 and 212 are both up and running ... so they are synchronized with 201 and 211, but the passive piece would be them just sitting around on the bench waiting for their turn to play.
10:15 < winem_:#liferay> hello, I'm a bit confused regarding liferay and java 8. several people in the community says that it's working fine with CE 6.2.1 but is it already supported or not? I can't find an official statement from liferay
10:18 < jardineworks_:#liferay> winem_, not supported yet I don't think
10:18 < jardineworks_:#liferay> Java 8 was release after 6.2
10:19 < jardineworks_:#liferay> winem_, best best is to stick with Java 7 for now
10:19 < winem_:#liferay> ok

10:33 < Urug_:#liferay> Having two databases is the requirement, however they don't have to be active passive, both of them can be used for reading/writing anytime, but they must stay synced. If one fo them fails, it must be (automatically) re-synced after the recovery.
10:34 < jardineworks_:#liferay> Urug_, ok. That part though would have to be managed by MySQL clustering which is configured and managed outside of Liferay. The clustering that Liferay manages through configuration only relates to resources that it manages -- namely, the search index and the ehcache (or whatever cache implementation you choose to use)
10:37 < Yam`:#liferay> jardineworks_, have you ever done a custom.css and having trouble with the ">" character (icon-like) of accordions tabs?
10:39 < Urug_:#liferay> Thank you very much it helped me to create a better picture. And what about the repository, the default is using file system, I need to replicate them as well...
