05:56 < Yam`:#liferay> hi
08:21 < Axxell:#liferay> Hey guys trying to ad to liferay 6.2 web content listing the ability to sort articles by title but i cant get it to work
08:21 < Axxell:#liferay> any clues?
08:31 < Axxell:#liferay> the error i get is: 12:17:15,247 ERROR [http-bio-8080-exec-7][JDBCExceptionReporter:82] Unknown column 'title' in 'order clause'
08:31 < Axxell:#liferay> older versions used the "title" column as a orderbycol
08:40 < Axxell:#liferay> i can sort by urlTitle but that doesnt help much
08:42 < Yam`:#liferay> Has somebody ever exported lportal base in an other computer and faced issues with groups?

09:28 < jardineworks_:#liferay> topolik, you around?
09:35 < Urug_:#liferay> I have got finished Liferay application running on single machine using bundled Tomcat server and MySQL db. Everything is setup as default. My task is to create another server instance which is going to be one-to-one replica of the existing one working as backup server. So these servers must be always sychronized. I've got zero experience with clustering or replicating. I am looking for any advice, direction or general information how t
09:37 < jardineworks_:#liferay> Urug_, Liferay clustering is easy. If you support multicast it is even easier. One minute, I think I have the instructions written down.
09:38 < jardineworks_:#liferay> Urug_, in your portal-ext -- add the following
09:38 < jardineworks_:#liferay> cluster.link.enabled=true
09:38 < jardineworks_:#liferay> cluster.link.autodetect.address=<some-address>:<some-port>
09:38 < jardineworks_:#liferay> lucene.replicate.write=true
09:39 < jardineworks_:#liferay> for the address and port, I think I used my database ip and 3306 (for MySQL)
09:39 < jardineworks_:#liferay> that will allow the ehcache and search index to remain in synch
09:40 < jardineworks_:#liferay> but if your setup is active passive, meaning the "backup instance" is never used unless the first instance goes down then you might not even need clustering. Clustering is only really necessary when both nodes are serving requests. If the backup only kicks in when the other node is down, it might be enough for them simply to be connected to the same database
09:40 < Yam`:#liferay> Is there a property file or something that links the usergroups to the portal?
09:41 < jardineworks_:#liferay> Yam`, the user groups that are created in the portal? or external user groups?
09:41 < Yam`:#liferay> jardineworks_, the user groups created in the portal
09:42 < Yam`:#liferay> because I've created user groups in the portal and exported the lportal database to another computer, I've got the user groups in the database but they are not displayed in the portal
09:42 < Yam`:#liferay> "no user groups were found"
09:43 < jardineworks_:#liferay> Yam`, go to the Server Administration .. clear the caches, and rebuild the serach indices.
09:43 < jardineworks_:#liferay> the user groups are created with in a portal instance (companyId) so exporting the database in its entirety will move everything -- or at least it should
09:44 < Yam`:#liferay> jardineworks_, the database cache ?
09:44 < Yam`:#liferay> or all of them ?
09:44 < jardineworks_:#liferay> Yam`, anything that is in that page
09:45 < jardineworks_:#liferay> the worst that will happen is that the site will be slow for a minute while that stuff is rebuilt.
09:45 < Yam`:#liferay> ok thanks
09:45 < jardineworks_:#liferay> Yam`, lemme know if that helps or not
09:48 < Yam`:#liferay> It worked, thanks jardineworks_, I've been struggling with this for half a day haha
09:48 < jardineworks_:#liferay> Yam`, I think I spent about half a day on it the first time I tried to solve that one :)
09:50 < Yam`:#liferay> Same here haha
09:55 < Urug_:#liferay> So it should be only about running another Liferay server and changing a Liferay configuration little bit. I mean I don't have to deal with some configuration out of Liferay sandbox.
09:56 < Urug_:#liferay> What about existing data are they going to be replicated?
09:56 < Urug_:#liferay> And what about liferay repository (files and documents)?
09:57 < jardineworks_:#liferay> Urug_, are you sharing the same database between both nodes?
09:59 < Urug_:#liferay> I quess they should be separated so  one of them can really work as backup.
09:59 < jardineworks_:#liferay> ah
09:59 < jardineworks_:#liferay> Urug_, ok so that is a different story. That sounds more like you are setting up a DR (disaster recovery)
10:00 < jardineworks_:#liferay> Which is not really a situation for clustering
10:05 < Urug_:#liferay> That's probably more appropriate term I quess, but basically two liferay instaces running in cluster could work the same way if active passive setup is not requierement, couldn't they?
10:07 < Urug_:#liferay> The requierement is to have access to application with all data up to date if one fo the erver will fail.
10:07 < Urug_:#liferay> *one of the servers
