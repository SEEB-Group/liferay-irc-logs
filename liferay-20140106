09:23 < 6JTAAX9RU:#liferay> Hi guys. Happy new year. ;)
09:26 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Has anyone of you ever encountered that Liferay renders articles with the wrong template?
09:26 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I have a couple of templates and each template has a dedicated structure.
09:27 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> So there is the same number of templates and structures.
09:36 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, do any of your structures have more than one template?
09:36 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> No.
09:38 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> So weird. One article is consequently rendered with the wrong template.
09:38 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> When I look into the DB, the article is actually associated with the correct template.
09:38 < jardineworks:#liferay> any chance the default template id in the database is wrong?
09:38 < jardineworks:#liferay> alright then
09:38 < jardineworks:#liferay> lol
09:41 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Mhm.
09:41 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Might be a caching issue.
09:41 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> It actually shows up correctly on live and staging...but only on the box the article was published on.
09:41 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> The others show it rendered with the wrong template.
09:41 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Very strange.

11:22 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Wow...this is really giving me headaches.
11:22 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Great first day of work. *sigh*
11:42 < olafk:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, if it's a caching issue, you can flush the caches in Controlpanel and try again. Also, what version are you on? Do you have a cluster or single machine?
