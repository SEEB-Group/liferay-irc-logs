09:23 < 6JTAAX9RU:#liferay> Hi guys. Happy new year. ;)
09:26 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Has anyone of you ever encountered that Liferay renders articles with the wrong template?
09:26 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I have a couple of templates and each template has a dedicated structure.
09:27 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> So there is the same number of templates and structures.
09:36 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, do any of your structures have more than one template?
09:36 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> No.
09:38 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> So weird. One article is consequently rendered with the wrong template.
09:38 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> When I look into the DB, the article is actually associated with the correct template.
09:38 < jardineworks:#liferay> any chance the default template id in the database is wrong?
09:38 < jardineworks:#liferay> alright then
09:38 < jardineworks:#liferay> lol
09:41 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Mhm.
09:41 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Might be a caching issue.
09:41 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> It actually shows up correctly on live and staging...but only on the box the article was published on.
09:41 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> The others show it rendered with the wrong template.
09:41 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Very strange.

11:22 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Wow...this is really giving me headaches.
11:22 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Great first day of work. *sigh*
11:42 < olafk:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, if it's a caching issue, you can flush the caches in Controlpanel and try again. Also, what version are you on? Do you have a cluster or single machine?
11:46 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Sadly I don't have access to the control panels on all nodes.
11:47 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> We're using a broken clustering setup with a whacky implementation via Quartz that checks for the last publishing action and supposedly flushes the cache.
11:48 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> The odd thing is that I created a new page with a new article using a new template and only retaining the structure...and still the same thing happens. Really odd.
15:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey rotty3000  -- do you have a minute for a question?
15:33 < olafk_:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur using a "broken clustering setup" should give enough hints that who-knows-what might happen in the cache. If you reproduce with a proper clustering setup or on a single node, this would be more valuable
15:34 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> It occurs on a live system we're in the process of replacing. The new system will consist of only one instance and a clustered proxy in front. The problem should be gone there...
15:34 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> But the people working with the old system still have to be able to get their stuff published...otherwise I wouldn't even bother.
15:35 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I guess I'll try some more combinations tomorrow and see if anything can be used as workaround.
