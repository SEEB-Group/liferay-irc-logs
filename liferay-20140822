18:25 < bijoo_:#liferay> maleen I just saw it when you mentioned it now; it seems it has a specific use case; when a prim key's removed from composite.
18:25 < bijoo_:#liferay> maleen his interface method impl calls it: com.liferay.portal.service.persistence.impl.TableMapper.addTableMapping(long, long)
18:26 < bijoo_:#liferay> "Adds an association between the organization and the groups. Also notifies the appropriate model listeners and clears the mapping table finder cache."
18:26 < bijoo_:#liferay> com.liferay.portal.service.persistence.OrganizationPersistenceImpl.addGroups(long, List<Group>)
18:26 < bijoo_:#liferay> So it's used where tight coupling assets.
18:27 < bijoo_:#liferay> maleen http://pastebin.com/76iSsKW9
18:27 < bijoo_:#liferay> maleen here are instances where it is used
18:28 < bijoo_:#liferay> Jadobi: hi, is it passed as a parameter?
18:30 < bijoo_:#liferay> Jadobi: com.liferay.portal.servlet.filters.sso.cas.CASFilter.processFilter(HttpServletRequest, HttpServletResponse, FilterChain)
18:31 < bijoo_:#liferay> Jadobi: seems it's passed as parameter 'ticket' ; I'd alter filter to add attribute
18:31 < bijoo_:#liferay> Jadobi: that way it'll be portlet accessible
