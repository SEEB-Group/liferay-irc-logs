05:46 < g33kyboi:#liferay> hello
05:46 < g33kyboi:#liferay> has anyone had any issues with developing a liferay theme using maven?
05:48 < g33kyboi:#liferay> I use liferay 6.2.0 and when a create a maven project and use the liferay:deploy goal the changes in the custom.css file are not effected instead the parent theme's custom.css is used?
05:48 < g33kyboi:#liferay> used.
05:48 < g33kyboi:#liferay> I have tried to copy the main.css file into the _diffs folder but still same result.
05:49 < g33kyboi:#liferay> Any suggestion or way around this?
08:34 < modd_:#liferay> I can still reproduce this issue in 6.2 GA2 CE: https://issues.liferay.com/browse/LPS-29894
11:48 < Uzzi:#liferay> I need help for liferyay+ldap. I see users but not Groups
12:06 < Uzzi:#liferay> when I'm testing LDAP Groups work fine, but Gruops doesn't compare in User Groups
12:07 < Uzzi:#liferay> Unable to import user cn=xxxxxx,ou=Groups: null:null:No attributes com.liferay.portal.UserScreenNameException: Screen name cannot be null for xxxxxxx
12:38 < jardineworks:#liferay> Uzzi -- do you NEED a screename? basically... do yo uuse screen name for the user name? or email?
12:42 < Uzzi:#liferay> (uid=@screen_name@)
12:42 < Uzzi:#liferay> I can view users, no Groups
12:44 < jardineworks:#liferay> Uzzi, not what I asked :) ... I asked if you NEED the screen name? if you don't then you can set it to auto-generate
12:44 < jardineworks:#liferay> which means the mappings are ignored anyway
12:44 < jardineworks:#liferay> but if you USE the screen name a the (login) username, that won't be an answer for you
12:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> or did this: <Uzzi>:(uid=@screen_name@) mean that you use the screen name as a login?
12:46 < Uzzi:#liferay> yes
12:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> Uzzi, I see -- apologies, I didn't understand that
12:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> ok -- and you have the same mapping for the USER section as you do the GROUP section?
12:47 < jardineworks:#liferay> and in the USER section it maps (as in finds it correctly), but in the GROUP section it does not?
12:48 < Uzzi:#liferay> users ar mappings, groups no
12:49 < Uzzi:#liferay> when I tryng to "Test LDAP Groups" in Portale Settings, grups are mapped
12:49 < Uzzi:#liferay> Groups are not mapped in User Group section
12:50 < Uzzi:#liferay> No user groups were found.
12:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> Uzzi, you did the configurations for both in the control panel right?
12:51 < Uzzi:#liferay> Test LDAP Groups works fine
