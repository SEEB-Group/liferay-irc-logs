05:46 < g33kyboi:#liferay> hello
05:46 < g33kyboi:#liferay> has anyone had any issues with developing a liferay theme using maven?
05:48 < g33kyboi:#liferay> I use liferay 6.2.0 and when a create a maven project and use the liferay:deploy goal the changes in the custom.css file are not effected instead the parent theme's custom.css is used?
05:48 < g33kyboi:#liferay> used.
05:48 < g33kyboi:#liferay> I have tried to copy the main.css file into the _diffs folder but still same result.
05:49 < g33kyboi:#liferay> Any suggestion or way around this?
08:34 < modd_:#liferay> I can still reproduce this issue in 6.2 GA2 CE: https://issues.liferay.com/browse/LPS-29894
