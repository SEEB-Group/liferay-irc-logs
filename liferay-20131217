02:55 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> any way to get a custom piece of code running like inserting into a database table/ writing to a file while a portal is being deployed?
06:16 < LRAdminInNeed26:#liferay> Hello
06:16 < LRAdminInNeed26:#liferay> dsjaf
06:25 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> anyone there ?
07:12 < hufg_:#liferay> yees yeses
07:13 < hufg_:#liferay> maan anyone know how to get jta datasource working properly using jpa+hibernate
07:13 < hufg_:#liferay> if i got this correctly you can have container managed transactions ie. no need to start and end transactions
07:14 < hufg_:#liferay> but no
07:31 < bjornjohansson:#liferay> I can't find a solution for this, https://www.liferay.com/community/forums/-/message_boards/message/16574035
07:31 < bjornjohansson:#liferay> I have exact the same problem
08:02 < hufg_:#liferay> :Z
08:15 < bjornjohansson:#liferay> I think I found it finally -_-
08:16 < bjornjohansson:#liferay> but the quality of the images is still sucky sucky :(
09:51 <@jhf:#liferay> jardineworks !!
09:54 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, !!
09:54 <@jhf:#liferay> friday IRC prize drawing for top contributor
09:55 < jardineworks:#liferay> :O
09:55 <@jhf:#liferay> I know it's not a huge giveaway but it will be fun nonetheless
09:55 <@jhf:#liferay> the anticipation
09:55 < jardineworks:#liferay> what time what time!
09:55 <@jhf:#liferay> 1500 GMT
09:55 < jardineworks:#liferay> I'm super excited :)
09:55 <@jhf:#liferay> which is 10am US/Eastern
09:55 < jardineworks:#liferay> better make sure I am not late for work then!
14:57 < Nudge:#liferay> hello
14:58 < Nudge:#liferay> does anybody know why most of a site's links still point to localhost:8080/web/... even after setting a virtual host url? I am using 6.2 GA1
15:07 < rkanakam:#liferay> hi there! I am migrating a theme to Liferay 6.2 and facing difficulty to figure out a way to call NavItem.fromLayouts(javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest request, List<Layout> layouts, Template template) method
15:08 < rkanakam:#liferay> the problem is with the Template object. This is due to the fact in change of API's for VelocityEngine etc in 6.2. Can anybody guide me in the right direction.
15:09 <@jhf:#liferay> rkanakam: not sure but you're not the only one wondering: https://www.liferay.com/community/forums/-/message_boards/message/32129531
15:09 <@jhf:#liferay> are you wondering what to pass for this object?
15:10 < rkanakam:#liferay> yes, I did refer to that topic in forums.
15:10 <@jhf:#liferay> according to https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/blame/master/portal-service/src/com/liferay/portal/theme/NavItem.java
15:11 < rkanakam:#liferay> well, I don't know how to get the Template object
15:11 < rkanakam:#liferay> yes, I was digging 6.2 source code since this morning
15:11 <@jhf:#liferay> it was added as part of https://issues.liferay.com/browse/LPS-33264
15:12 < rkanakam:#liferay> yes
15:13 < rkanakam:#liferay> i happened to see it
15:13 <@jhf:#liferay> ok so before, you passed a templateContext object? e.g. in Liferay 6.1?
15:15 < rkanakam:#liferay> this was the usage in 6.1 ,navItems = NavItem.fromLayouts(rv, newMainLayouts); rv==RequestVars and newMainLayouts==List<Layout>
15:15 <@jhf:#liferay> hmm
15:17 < rkanakam:#liferay> fromLayouts(HttpServletRequest request, List<Layout> layouts, Template template)
15:17 < rkanakam:#liferay> as you saw the signature is changed to this now
15:17 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah.. the new arg was added in https://issues.liferay.com/browse/LPS-27796
15:18 <@jhf:#liferay> gonna go look at sample themes and see what they had to change to account for this
15:20 < rkanakam:#liferay> fyi..i am calling a service (which works with NavItem.*) from vm template.
15:20 < rkanakam:#liferay> thanks jhf for your time
15:25 <@jhf:#liferay> what if you just pass a null rkanakam ?
15:25 <@jhf:#liferay> for the template parameter
15:26 < platzhirsch:#liferay> Any idea what the difference between Liferay and Drupal is?
15:27 < rkanakam:#liferay> not a bad idea to try. however I see two reference to template object in Navitem class
15:30 <@jhf:#liferay> yes I do too! just curious if it'd work for you.
15:30 <@jhf:#liferay> oh there's also a tool written by our friends in spain to convert themes for 6.2. I bet it must've dealt with this too. lemme check that.
15:30 < rkanakam:#liferay> ohh okay.you didn't hit the NPE scenario?
15:30 <@jhf:#liferay> nope
15:31 < rkanakam:#liferay> nice
15:31 <@jhf:#liferay> but I don't know why :) i'm not familiar with this code, just inspecting the change that introduced it.
15:32 <@jhf:#liferay> also, one question: do you really need to call NavItems.fromLayouts ?
15:32 <@jhf:#liferay> isn't there a variable already prepared called $navItems ?
15:32 <@jhf:#liferay> that you can use?
15:32 <@jhf:#liferay> from velocity and/or freemarker
15:33 < rkanakam:#liferay> yes that is correct. let me try that too
16:36 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey jhf do you know if there is a bug in 6.1.2 for custom attributes? where it basically doesn;t allow you to create them in the control panel?
16:37 < jardineworks:#liferay> i just tried to add one and I get the success message saying that it created it... but it is not listed in the table.
16:38 <@jhf:#liferay> hmm
16:38 <@jhf:#liferay> not aware of that.
16:39 <@jhf:#liferay> I can give it a go right now. standby.
16:39 < rkanakam:#liferay> I am here
16:41 <@jhf:#liferay> worked for me jardineworks - but I'm using hsql (out of the box)
16:41 <@jhf:#liferay> any weird characters in the name?
16:41 < jardineworks:#liferay> hmm -- db shouldn't matter though right? I mean my user has full rights and I am creating records and such without issue
16:41 <@jhf:#liferay> are you doing this as an OmniAdmin ?
16:42 <@jhf:#liferay> it shouldn't
16:42 < jardineworks:#liferay> "interests"
16:42 < jardineworks:#liferay> :)
16:42 <@jhf:#liferay> weren't you monkeying with permissions related to custom fields a couple of weeks ago :)
16:43 <@jhf:#liferay> did you edit a jsp perhaps? o
16:44 < jardineworks:#liferay> hhahah - I was but I never got that to work so I rolled it all back.
16:44 < jardineworks:#liferay> I have some fields in place already, but they are a result of when I added them on 6.1.1 ... I haven't tried to add since. Maybe I'll see if my hook will do it for me
16:45 <@jhf:#liferay> ok. perhaps your programmatic hook code that add(ed) them didn't set enough permissions for that jsp that renders the table to 'see' them
16:45 <@jhf:#liferay> are they actually in the DB though?
16:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> \o/
16:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> hook adds them no problem
16:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> just the add interface that doesn't seem to like me today
16:47 < jardineworks:#liferay> meh -- end goal acheived :)
16:47 <@jhf:#liferay> if you look in the jsp that renders it, it's probably got some permission if/else that prevents it
16:49 < jardineworks:#liferay> but if I were being blocked by permissions (I am logged in as the admin though so that shouldn;t be it right?) shouldn't it at least show me an error instead of the success message?
16:50 <@jhf:#liferay> hmmmm
16:50 <@jhf:#liferay> can you show me the code you are using to add the custom fields again?
16:57 < jardineworks:#liferay> sure -- one sec.
16:59 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf,  http://pastebin.com/JCi6hGtX
17:00 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah that just adds the custom table for the User entity, where is the code that adds the columns to said table?
17:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> oh --  I never got that working. I have a huge commented out block though with probably mroe than one attempted approach. one sec..
17:06 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, http://pastebin.com/1TPDwkhC
17:13 <@jhf:#liferay> if you re-index, do they appear?
17:13 <@jhf:#liferay> go to control panel -> server administration
17:13 <@jhf:#liferay> click 'reindex all search indices'
17:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> nope
17:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> I'll try it again later and have a look at the db to see if they are added there
