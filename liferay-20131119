04:19 < hufg:#liferay> anyone ever wondered how massive a theme can be? 8)
04:20 < hufg:#liferay> maan there is a lot of code in the theme
04:22 < hufg:#liferay> ehh this theme i meant
04:41 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Our theme loads 40 JS files on every page.
04:41 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Tell me about massive.
04:42 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> They were to dumb to do it properly and now there is all JS code embedded in the theme...and the different JS files use indexOf('some-url-snippet') to check if they should be run on the current page. So sad.
04:47 < hufg:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur: hehe
04:48 < hufg:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur: we use requirejs for that
04:48 < hufg:#liferay> a few problems still exists but it's the right choice
04:48 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> The problem is that refactoring this mess will be very difficult and time-consuming.
04:49 < hufg:#liferay> 8)
04:49 < hufg:#liferay> yeah it would have some work load
04:50 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Mhm. One of my frontend devs is complaining that CSS hotdeployment doesn't work.
04:51 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Is there an easy way to check if he disabled the CSS fast load stuff correctly?
04:52 < hufg:#liferay> mm just see portal-ext.props
04:52 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I think he added -Dexternal-properties=portal-developer.properties to his Tomcat run configuration.
04:52 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> This should pretty much disable all caching, shouldn't it?
04:55 < hufg:#liferay> mm
04:55 < hufg:#liferay> no idea
04:55 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> The file is correctly deployed...I can access it directly and see the change. But apparently the process behind this main.css stuff didn't recognize this change.
04:55 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I thought it should be deactivated when I shut off all this caching stuff. -.-
05:07 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Sometimes I think it would be cheaper to give all content editors HTML training and work with static pages only...
05:26 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Mhm. I get a 404 for /html/themes/control_panel/css/compass, because it tries to retrieve that from our CDN.
05:27 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I would assume that this is some kind of CSS magic that does some optimization or something...and this definitely shouldn't be retrieved from the CDN...
05:31 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> topolik: Hi there. I remember reading some CSS related things in your blog. Do you know your way around Liferay's CSS stuff?
05:32 < topolik:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur: Hi, well, CSS basics :)
05:32 < topolik:#liferay> how can I help?
05:33 < topolik:#liferay> I see, the previous conversation, right?
05:36 < topolik:#liferay> so when you directly hit the http://portal/xxx-portlet/css/main.css the changes are there, right?
05:36 < topolik:#liferay> but they are not visible on the page
05:36 < topolik:#liferay> can you verify how is the CSS file linked from the page?
05:37 < topolik:#liferay> it should be something like http://portal/xxx-portlet/main.css?browserId=...&themeId=...t=...
05:38 < topolik:#liferay> can you display that file in your browser and try force refresh? i.e. CTRL+F5?
05:45 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> When I access the main.css?browser... directly, I get a bunch of import statements.
05:46 < topolik:#liferay> and what you get without the query string, the same?
05:47 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> The same but with some empty lines between the imports.
05:47 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> There is also another link to a main.css, which provides much more CSS.
05:47 < topolik:#liferay> hmm
05:47 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> The first is /html/css/main.css?browser....
05:47 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> The second is from the Theme.
05:48 < topolik:#liferay> ah, right, one is portal default styles
05:48 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> http://liferay.local/my-theme/css/main.css?browser...
