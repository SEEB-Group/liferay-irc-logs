04:19 < hufg:#liferay> anyone ever wondered how massive a theme can be? 8)
04:20 < hufg:#liferay> maan there is a lot of code in the theme
04:22 < hufg:#liferay> ehh this theme i meant
04:41 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Our theme loads 40 JS files on every page.
04:41 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Tell me about massive.
04:42 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> They were to dumb to do it properly and now there is all JS code embedded in the theme...and the different JS files use indexOf('some-url-snippet') to check if they should be run on the current page. So sad.
