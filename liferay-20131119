04:19 < hufg:#liferay> anyone ever wondered how massive a theme can be? 8)
04:20 < hufg:#liferay> maan there is a lot of code in the theme
04:22 < hufg:#liferay> ehh this theme i meant
04:41 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Our theme loads 40 JS files on every page.
04:41 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Tell me about massive.
04:42 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> They were to dumb to do it properly and now there is all JS code embedded in the theme...and the different JS files use indexOf('some-url-snippet') to check if they should be run on the current page. So sad.
04:47 < hufg:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur: hehe
04:48 < hufg:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur: we use requirejs for that
04:48 < hufg:#liferay> a few problems still exists but it's the right choice
04:48 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> The problem is that refactoring this mess will be very difficult and time-consuming.
04:49 < hufg:#liferay> 8)
04:49 < hufg:#liferay> yeah it would have some work load
04:50 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Mhm. One of my frontend devs is complaining that CSS hotdeployment doesn't work.
04:51 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Is there an easy way to check if he disabled the CSS fast load stuff correctly?
04:52 < hufg:#liferay> mm just see portal-ext.props
04:52 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I think he added -Dexternal-properties=portal-developer.properties to his Tomcat run configuration.
04:52 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> This should pretty much disable all caching, shouldn't it?
