01:13 < Axxell:#liferay> anyone available to answer some questions?
07:25 < goku_:#liferay> hi
07:27 < goku_:#liferay> what is the class required for the Site Object for accessing site's custom field site.getExpandoBridge().getAttribute("custome_field_name");
07:28 < goku_:#liferay> which package should i import for Site object
07:30 < topolik1:#liferay> goku_: hi, site object is com.liferay.portal.model.Group
07:48 < Axxell:#liferay> topolik1: is there a way to include an assetpublisher portlet in an assetpublisher portlet using application display templates?
07:50 < Axxell:#liferay> topolik1: onother question i am using AssetEntryLocalServiceUtil.updateEntry to update categories of filentrys in a portlet. When i go to documents and media the categories are shown as they should... but when i go to an assetpublisher configured to show assets with those categories it doesnt show before i save the filentry as a new one in documents and media
08:13 < Yam`:#liferay> Hello!
08:14 < Yam`:#liferay> been a while! :D
08:14 < goku_:#liferay> @topolink : thanks
08:49 < Axxell:#liferay> topolik: care to analyze what is going wrong?
08:52 < Yam`:#liferay> I have a portlet with a select element. Can I do actions in my java code of my portlet when the user select an option?
08:52 < topolik:#liferay> Axxell: I'm sorry, I see the question now
08:52 < Yam`:#liferay> I didn't find how to do it
08:53 < topolik:#liferay> Axxell: I think it should be possible to include any portlet from ADT, depends on what everything is accessible from the velocity context
08:54 < Axxell:#liferay> topolik: ive tried two methods the runtime tag and theme.runtime
08:54 < Axxell:#liferay> topolik: btw im using freemarker
08:55 < Axxell:#liferay> topolik: none of them seem to work
08:56 < topolik:#liferay> did you try the Ajax method from Ray's blog? https://www.liferay.com/web/raymond.auge/blog/-/blogs/embedding-portlets-in-themes-on-liferay
08:57 < Axxell:#liferay> did not try the ajax iframe
08:58 < Axxell:#liferay> but theme.runtime does not seem to be available in an assetpublisher ADT
09:00 < olafk:#liferay> Axxell: An AP within an AP? AP aggregates content, not portlets. Not sure what my mental model should be if I'd be tasked to maintain this.
09:00 < topolik:#liferay> I need to check sources to see what's in freemarker. I remember 6.1 freemarker was not very supported, I hope 6.2 is better
09:01 < olafk:#liferay> For those of you interested in mobile sdk stuff: Bruno Farache is preparing the next Dev.Life session, starting in an hour. You might want to join #liferay-dev-life
09:01 < Axxell:#liferay> topolik: yup its a bit strange, but wanted to do it, it only actually shows a list AP within the first asset of the parent AP
09:02 < Yam`:#liferay> <Yam`> I have a portlet with a select element. Can I do actions in my java code of my portlet when the user select an option? > I tried to do onChange="${myJavaProcessAction}" in the select but it doesn't work
09:03 < Axxell:#liferay> topolik: the other problem: when i change in my portlet an assets categoryIds, i am not able to se the asset in an AP configured to show assets of a category.. cant find what might be going wrong.. any ideas?
09:03 < olafk:#liferay> Also: If you're planning to attend DevCon in november: Call For Paper open, Registration as well, and the unconference will be limited: https://www.liferay.com/en/web/olaf.kock/blog/-/blogs/devcon-2014-call-for-paper-and-registration-open-unconference-coming-again
