01:13 < Axxell:#liferay> anyone available to answer some questions?
07:25 < goku_:#liferay> hi
07:27 < goku_:#liferay> what is the class required for the Site Object for accessing site's custom field site.getExpandoBridge().getAttribute("custome_field_name");
07:28 < goku_:#liferay> which package should i import for Site object
07:30 < topolik1:#liferay> goku_: hi, site object is com.liferay.portal.model.Group
07:48 < Axxell:#liferay> topolik1: is there a way to include an assetpublisher portlet in an assetpublisher portlet using application display templates?
07:50 < Axxell:#liferay> topolik1: onother question i am using AssetEntryLocalServiceUtil.updateEntry to update categories of filentrys in a portlet. When i go to documents and media the categories are shown as they should... but when i go to an assetpublisher configured to show assets with those categories it doesnt show before i save the filentry as a new one in documents and media
08:13 < Yam`:#liferay> Hello!
08:14 < Yam`:#liferay> been a while! :D
08:14 < goku_:#liferay> @topolink : thanks
08:49 < Axxell:#liferay> topolik: care to analyze what is going wrong?
08:52 < Yam`:#liferay> I have a portlet with a select element. Can I do actions in my java code of my portlet when the user select an option?
08:52 < topolik:#liferay> Axxell: I'm sorry, I see the question now
08:52 < Yam`:#liferay> I didn't find how to do it
08:53 < topolik:#liferay> Axxell: I think it should be possible to include any portlet from ADT, depends on what everything is accessible from the velocity context
08:54 < Axxell:#liferay> topolik: ive tried two methods the runtime tag and theme.runtime
08:54 < Axxell:#liferay> topolik: btw im using freemarker
08:55 < Axxell:#liferay> topolik: none of them seem to work
08:56 < topolik:#liferay> did you try the Ajax method from Ray's blog? https://www.liferay.com/web/raymond.auge/blog/-/blogs/embedding-portlets-in-themes-on-liferay
08:57 < Axxell:#liferay> did not try the ajax iframe
08:58 < Axxell:#liferay> but theme.runtime does not seem to be available in an assetpublisher ADT
09:00 < olafk:#liferay> Axxell: An AP within an AP? AP aggregates content, not portlets. Not sure what my mental model should be if I'd be tasked to maintain this.
09:00 < topolik:#liferay> I need to check sources to see what's in freemarker. I remember 6.1 freemarker was not very supported, I hope 6.2 is better
09:01 < olafk:#liferay> For those of you interested in mobile sdk stuff: Bruno Farache is preparing the next Dev.Life session, starting in an hour. You might want to join #liferay-dev-life
09:01 < Axxell:#liferay> topolik: yup its a bit strange, but wanted to do it, it only actually shows a list AP within the first asset of the parent AP
09:02 < Yam`:#liferay> <Yam`> I have a portlet with a select element. Can I do actions in my java code of my portlet when the user select an option? > I tried to do onChange="${myJavaProcessAction}" in the select but it doesn't work
09:03 < Axxell:#liferay> topolik: the other problem: when i change in my portlet an assets categoryIds, i am not able to se the asset in an AP configured to show assets of a category.. cant find what might be going wrong.. any ideas?
09:03 < olafk:#liferay> Also: If you're planning to attend DevCon in november: Call For Paper open, Registration as well, and the unconference will be limited: https://www.liferay.com/en/web/olaf.kock/blog/-/blogs/devcon-2014-call-for-paper-and-registration-open-unconference-coming-again
09:04 < topolik:#liferay> Yam`: onChange is a javascript method, if you want browser to send a request to server you need at least <select onchange="location.href='<portlet:actionURL name="myAction" />'">
09:05 < topolik:#liferay> Axxell: sorry, I'm now debugging 6.1 EE, if you wait some time I switch over to 6.2 CE and can try to reproduce the second issue
09:06 < Yam`:#liferay> topolik, right, thank you
09:07 < Axxell:#liferay> topolik: maybe when can check it another day, need to get going. Ill be checking the logs if you feel like putting som suggestions here when im not available
09:08 < topolik:#liferay> Axxell: ok
09:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> Germany again for dev con?!
09:22 < olafk:#liferay> yup, close to Frankfurt: We're in Darmstadt this time
09:22 < jardineworks:#liferay> olafk, well, I've always wanted to see germany :)
09:23 < olafk:#liferay> for the size of the event, it's the best alternative to organize it properly. And Frankfurt is easy to reach from everywhere in europe
09:23 < jardineworks:#liferay> are you guys going to be showcasing anything from LR 7?
09:23 < olafk:#liferay> probably. Check the preliminary agenda: www.liferay.com/devcon2014
09:24 < olafk:#liferay> and I guess that the unconference will get several sessions on the future aspects
09:24 < olafk:#liferay> (hint hint)
09:36 < jardineworks:#liferay> olafk, \o/
09:36 < jardineworks:#liferay> :)
09:36 < jardineworks:#liferay> That might be enough to entice me to go
09:36 < jardineworks:#liferay> how good are the sausages in Frankfurt :)
09:36 < olafk:#liferay> "it depends" (TM)
09:37 < olafk:#liferay> For the unconference: Note that this is my expectation - it's all up to the agenda setting and the ones participating. You can assume that most of the speakers you see on the agenda for the next days will be at the unconference as well.
09:38 < jardineworks:#liferay> c'mon olafk .. commit already! :) ... is the food better or worse than in Munich?!
09:38 < jardineworks:#liferay> (not that I have ever been and would know any different anyway)
09:40 < olafk:#liferay> Unconference: What can I commit for? The agenda for that day is as final as it gets - won't be changed until 4. November, 10:00 https://www.liferay.com/web/devcon2014#agenda
09:40 < olafk:#liferay> Food: As you've not been in Munich and I don't know your taste: Sure it's better :)
09:41 < olafk:#liferay> There's a brewery that we chose for the community event
09:41 < dave_k1:#liferay> Hmmm. Darmstadt. Gotta persuade my team leader to send me there. Need to visit some friends ;)
09:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> olafk, hahah .. perfect. Time to look for flights. Thanks :)
09:50 -!- mode/#liferay [+o jhf] by ChanServ
09:50 <@jhf:#liferay> 10 minutes to showtime
09:50 <@jhf:#liferay> https://www.liferay.com/community/dev.life/home
09:50 <@jhf:#liferay> we are all in #liferay-dev-life for Brunoâ€™s mobile sdk session
09:58 < winem_:#liferay> great tip, thank you!
09:59 < rockhopper:#liferay> good day all.. I have a 6.1 question
09:59 < rockhopper:#liferay> I have a A.Dialog which works the first time I click to pop it up
10:00 < rockhopper:#liferay> but after closing it and trying to use it again I get
10:00 < rockhopper:#liferay> undefined is not a constructor (evaluating new a.Dialog)
10:00 < rockhopper:#liferay> any thoughts on what I may be missing?
10:26 < Yam`:#liferay> can I have a hashmap in Java and access it in my jsp using <c:out value="${myHashMap.something}" />?
10:28 < olafk:#liferay> Yam` have you tried it already?
10:29 < Yam`:#liferay> yes
10:30 < Yam`:#liferay> I don't know how to retrieve data from it
10:30 < Yam`:#liferay> in Java I'd do map.get(key)
10:30 < Yam`:#liferay> but I don't know how to do it in jsp (if there is a way)
10:44 < olafk:#liferay> isn't it ${myHashMap["something"]}? Ancient Memory
10:44 < olafk:#liferay> and you probably can omit the c:out tag
10:44 < Yam`:#liferay> If I want to do that in a script
10:44 < Yam`:#liferay> like
10:45 < Yam`:#liferay> function selectChange(option)
10:46 < Yam`:#liferay> I tried alert(<:out value="${myMap['"option"']}" />
10:47 < Yam`:#liferay> I ended with the error "= symbol expected"
10:51 < Yam`:#liferay> with only alert(${myMap[option].name} it works but the alert is empty
10:53 < Yam`:#liferay> can I display the format of this object so I can understand how to access its fields?
10:59 < rockhopper:#liferay> hmm.. seems if I use bodyContent in the Dialog, I can click on it several time, but if I use URI, I get the undefined is not a constructor (evaluating new a.Dialog)
10:59 < rockhopper:#liferay> the second time
11:44 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, olafk do either or you know if it is possible to get access to the PortalInstances class from inside a Struts Action hook?
11:58 < Yam`:#liferay> jardineworks, do you know if Liferay has a feature to do dependent combobox ?
12:02 < jardineworks:#liferay> Yam`, what do you mean a dependent combo box?
12:02 < Yam`:#liferay> if I change the selected option of the first one, it changes the options of the second
