01:13 < Axxell:#liferay> anyone available to answer some questions?
07:25 < goku_:#liferay> hi
07:27 < goku_:#liferay> what is the class required for the Site Object for accessing site's custom field site.getExpandoBridge().getAttribute("custome_field_name");
07:28 < goku_:#liferay> which package should i import for Site object
07:30 < topolik1:#liferay> goku_: hi, site object is com.liferay.portal.model.Group
07:48 < Axxell:#liferay> topolik1: is there a way to include an assetpublisher portlet in an assetpublisher portlet using application display templates?
07:50 < Axxell:#liferay> topolik1: onother question i am using AssetEntryLocalServiceUtil.updateEntry to update categories of filentrys in a portlet. When i go to documents and media the categories are shown as they should... but when i go to an assetpublisher configured to show assets with those categories it doesnt show before i save the filentry as a new one in documents and media
08:13 < Yam`:#liferay> Hello!
08:14 < Yam`:#liferay> been a while! :D
08:14 < goku_:#liferay> @topolink : thanks
08:49 < Axxell:#liferay> topolik: care to analyze what is going wrong?
08:52 < Yam`:#liferay> I have a portlet with a select element. Can I do actions in my java code of my portlet when the user select an option?
08:52 < topolik:#liferay> Axxell: I'm sorry, I see the question now
08:52 < Yam`:#liferay> I didn't find how to do it
08:53 < topolik:#liferay> Axxell: I think it should be possible to include any portlet from ADT, depends on what everything is accessible from the velocity context
08:54 < Axxell:#liferay> topolik: ive tried two methods the runtime tag and theme.runtime
08:54 < Axxell:#liferay> topolik: btw im using freemarker
08:55 < Axxell:#liferay> topolik: none of them seem to work
08:56 < topolik:#liferay> did you try the Ajax method from Ray's blog? https://www.liferay.com/web/raymond.auge/blog/-/blogs/embedding-portlets-in-themes-on-liferay
08:57 < Axxell:#liferay> did not try the ajax iframe
08:58 < Axxell:#liferay> but theme.runtime does not seem to be available in an assetpublisher ADT
09:00 < olafk:#liferay> Axxell: An AP within an AP? AP aggregates content, not portlets. Not sure what my mental model should be if I'd be tasked to maintain this.
09:00 < topolik:#liferay> I need to check sources to see what's in freemarker. I remember 6.1 freemarker was not very supported, I hope 6.2 is better
09:01 < olafk:#liferay> For those of you interested in mobile sdk stuff: Bruno Farache is preparing the next Dev.Life session, starting in an hour. You might want to join #liferay-dev-life
09:01 < Axxell:#liferay> topolik: yup its a bit strange, but wanted to do it, it only actually shows a list AP within the first asset of the parent AP
09:02 < Yam`:#liferay> <Yam`> I have a portlet with a select element. Can I do actions in my java code of my portlet when the user select an option? > I tried to do onChange="${myJavaProcessAction}" in the select but it doesn't work
09:03 < Axxell:#liferay> topolik: the other problem: when i change in my portlet an assets categoryIds, i am not able to se the asset in an AP configured to show assets of a category.. cant find what might be going wrong.. any ideas?
09:03 < olafk:#liferay> Also: If you're planning to attend DevCon in november: Call For Paper open, Registration as well, and the unconference will be limited: https://www.liferay.com/en/web/olaf.kock/blog/-/blogs/devcon-2014-call-for-paper-and-registration-open-unconference-coming-again
09:04 < topolik:#liferay> Yam`: onChange is a javascript method, if you want browser to send a request to server you need at least <select onchange="location.href='<portlet:actionURL name="myAction" />'">
09:05 < topolik:#liferay> Axxell: sorry, I'm now debugging 6.1 EE, if you wait some time I switch over to 6.2 CE and can try to reproduce the second issue
09:06 < Yam`:#liferay> topolik, right, thank you
09:07 < Axxell:#liferay> topolik: maybe when can check it another day, need to get going. Ill be checking the logs if you feel like putting som suggestions here when im not available
09:08 < topolik:#liferay> Axxell: ok
09:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> Germany again for dev con?!
09:22 < olafk:#liferay> yup, close to Frankfurt: We're in Darmstadt this time
09:22 < jardineworks:#liferay> olafk, well, I've always wanted to see germany :)
09:23 < olafk:#liferay> for the size of the event, it's the best alternative to organize it properly. And Frankfurt is easy to reach from everywhere in europe
09:23 < jardineworks:#liferay> are you guys going to be showcasing anything from LR 7?
09:23 < olafk:#liferay> probably. Check the preliminary agenda: www.liferay.com/devcon2014
09:24 < olafk:#liferay> and I guess that the unconference will get several sessions on the future aspects
09:24 < olafk:#liferay> (hint hint)
09:36 < jardineworks:#liferay> olafk, \o/
09:36 < jardineworks:#liferay> :)
09:36 < jardineworks:#liferay> That might be enough to entice me to go
09:36 < jardineworks:#liferay> how good are the sausages in Frankfurt :)
09:36 < olafk:#liferay> "it depends" (TM)
09:37 < olafk:#liferay> For the unconference: Note that this is my expectation - it's all up to the agenda setting and the ones participating. You can assume that most of the speakers you see on the agenda for the next days will be at the unconference as well.
09:38 < jardineworks:#liferay> c'mon olafk .. commit already! :) ... is the food better or worse than in Munich?!
09:38 < jardineworks:#liferay> (not that I have ever been and would know any different anyway)
09:40 < olafk:#liferay> Unconference: What can I commit for? The agenda for that day is as final as it gets - won't be changed until 4. November, 10:00 https://www.liferay.com/web/devcon2014#agenda
09:40 < olafk:#liferay> Food: As you've not been in Munich and I don't know your taste: Sure it's better :)
09:41 < olafk:#liferay> There's a brewery that we chose for the community event
09:41 < dave_k1:#liferay> Hmmm. Darmstadt. Gotta persuade my team leader to send me there. Need to visit some friends ;)
09:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> olafk, hahah .. perfect. Time to look for flights. Thanks :)
09:50 -!- mode/#liferay [+o jhf] by ChanServ
09:50 <@jhf:#liferay> 10 minutes to showtime
09:50 <@jhf:#liferay> https://www.liferay.com/community/dev.life/home
09:50 <@jhf:#liferay> we are all in #liferay-dev-life for Bruno’s mobile sdk session
09:58 < winem_:#liferay> great tip, thank you!
09:59 < rockhopper:#liferay> good day all.. I have a 6.1 question
09:59 < rockhopper:#liferay> I have a A.Dialog which works the first time I click to pop it up
10:00 < rockhopper:#liferay> but after closing it and trying to use it again I get
10:00 < rockhopper:#liferay> undefined is not a constructor (evaluating new a.Dialog)
10:00 < rockhopper:#liferay> any thoughts on what I may be missing?
10:26 < Yam`:#liferay> can I have a hashmap in Java and access it in my jsp using <c:out value="${myHashMap.something}" />?
10:28 < olafk:#liferay> Yam` have you tried it already?
10:29 < Yam`:#liferay> yes
10:30 < Yam`:#liferay> I don't know how to retrieve data from it
10:30 < Yam`:#liferay> in Java I'd do map.get(key)
10:30 < Yam`:#liferay> but I don't know how to do it in jsp (if there is a way)
10:44 < olafk:#liferay> isn't it ${myHashMap["something"]}? Ancient Memory
10:44 < olafk:#liferay> and you probably can omit the c:out tag
10:44 < Yam`:#liferay> If I want to do that in a script
10:44 < Yam`:#liferay> like
10:45 < Yam`:#liferay> function selectChange(option)
10:46 < Yam`:#liferay> I tried alert(<:out value="${myMap['"option"']}" />
10:47 < Yam`:#liferay> I ended with the error "= symbol expected"
10:51 < Yam`:#liferay> with only alert(${myMap[option].name} it works but the alert is empty
10:53 < Yam`:#liferay> can I display the format of this object so I can understand how to access its fields?
10:59 < rockhopper:#liferay> hmm.. seems if I use bodyContent in the Dialog, I can click on it several time, but if I use URI, I get the undefined is not a constructor (evaluating new a.Dialog)
10:59 < rockhopper:#liferay> the second time
11:44 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, olafk do either or you know if it is possible to get access to the PortalInstances class from inside a Struts Action hook?
11:58 < Yam`:#liferay> jardineworks, do you know if Liferay has a feature to do dependent combobox ?
12:02 < jardineworks:#liferay> Yam`, what do you mean a dependent combo box?
12:02 < Yam`:#liferay> if I change the selected option of the first one, it changes the options of the second
12:03 < jardineworks:#liferay> Yam`, Oh... I'm not sure. But you should be able to do that with some JS no?
12:03 <@jhf:#liferay> also, am I just dumb, or couldn’t you just access a value from a map using <%= myMap.get(“foo”) %>
12:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, you could... as long as youy <% HashMap<String, String> mymap = (HashMap<String,String>)ParamUtil.getAttribute(request, "myMap"); first... BUT... purists will say that scriptlets are bad
12:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> but who gives a shit about purists ;)
12:05 <@jhf:#liferay> sure, well, regardless of how the map gets into the jsp execution context
12:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> what about my PortalInstances class though?
12:05 <@jhf:#liferay> you can access values from it using <%= map.get(key) %>
12:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> true
12:06 <@jhf:#liferay> scriptlets are wonderful! you can write java and business logic in your view code!
12:06 <@jhf:#liferay> totally saves time
12:06 < Yam`:#liferay> and if the key is an argument of a javascript function?
12:07 < Yam`:#liferay> should I do something like <%= map.get(%>key<%) %> ?
12:07 <@jhf:#liferay> uhh
12:07 <@jhf:#liferay> that won’t work
12:08 <@jhf:#liferay> the jsp is processed on the server side, well before any javascript is executed by the client browser
12:08 < Yam`:#liferay> how do I use the key, so?
12:09 <@jhf:#liferay> hmmm.. how to explain
12:09 <@jhf:#liferay> so if key is a JS function argument, the value of “key” won’t be known until the client’s browser executes the function
12:10 <@jhf:#liferay> so you’d have to make some kind of AJAX call back to the portal (portlet) with the value of ‘key'
12:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, need some love! :)... If I need to access some core portal-impl stuff... is EXT the only way? am I screwed?
12:14 <@jhf:#liferay> what do you mean “access” ? you can always write java code that makes calls into portalimpl-specific classes and methods (be sure NOT to include a copy of it in your WAR file).
12:14 <@jhf:#liferay> it’s a terrible idea, though.
12:14 <@jhf:#liferay> but it’s possible without special magic
12:15 < Yam`:#liferay> I've heard of a liferay feature called "adressess.jsp", do you know how to use it or a tutorial?
12:15 < Yam`:#liferay> addressess*
12:15 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, I am working on that localized domain names thing. I have my L10NVirtualHost service builder working, and I have a struts hook for the EditInstanceAction written so that I am saving records in the L10NVirtualHost table. Now I need to do the logic from the original struts action to create the company and initialize it.
12:15 < Yam`:#liferay> addresses* (finally)
12:16 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, I can create the company usign the CompanyServiceUtil class... but I need to call PortalInstances.initCompany ... which I can't because I can't see it in my hook
12:16 < jardineworks:#liferay> I know you can cheat sometimes and use the PortalBeanLocator... but I don't think I can in this case because I can't resolve the class ... so I can't cast the result... meaning I can't init the company :(
12:17 <@jhf:#liferay> what do you mean “can’t see it in my hook?
12:17 <@jhf:#liferay> you mean your IDE can’t resolve the class? or do you get an exception at runtime?
12:19 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, IDE can't resolve the class
12:19 < jardineworks:#liferay> but that normally means that it wouldn't find it at runtime either
12:19 <@jhf:#liferay> nahhh
12:19 <@jhf:#liferay> this is Liferay man!
12:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> because portal-impl is in a different class loader!
12:20 <@jhf:#liferay> classloader black magic abounds!
12:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> HOW!?
12:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> lol
12:20 <@jhf:#liferay> import portal-impl.jar as a *compile-time* scoped dependency
12:20 <@jhf:#liferay> (such that it is not packaged into the WAR file when you build your war file)
12:20 <@jhf:#liferay> it should work..
12:20 <@jhf:#liferay> at least it did back in 6.1!
12:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> but at runtime, my hook will have a different class loader than the portal.
12:21 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah that classloader should be a descendent of the one that knows of portal-impl
12:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> really?!
12:22 <@jhf:#liferay> I think so! I guess I should try this stuff out :)
12:22 < jardineworks:#liferay> lol
12:22 < jardineworks:#liferay> so like this?
12:22 < jardineworks:#liferay> 		<dependency>
12:22 < jardineworks:#liferay> 			<groupId>com.liferay.portal</groupId>
12:22 < jardineworks:#liferay> 			<artifactId>portal-impl</artifactId>
12:22 < jardineworks:#liferay> 			<version>${liferay.version}</version>
12:22 < jardineworks:#liferay> 			<scope>compile</scope>
12:22 < jardineworks:#liferay> 		</dependency>				
12:22 <@jhf:#liferay> no you want <scope>provided</scope>
12:23 <@jhf:#liferay> actually do we even publish portal-impl to maven central?
12:23 <@jhf:#liferay> ah yeah we do
12:25 < jardineworks:#liferay> wait a minute
12:25 < jardineworks:#liferay> oh... nevermind. was about to ask a silly question :)
12:26 < jardineworks:#liferay> If this works though, then I might be able to do this without an EXT plugin
12:26 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah.. I don’t think it’s gonna work
12:27 <@jhf:#liferay> I was thinking that since you can access other jars in WEB-INF/lib that portal-impl.jar could also be accessed
12:27 < Yam`:#liferay> so... any of you know addresses.jsp? :)
12:27 <@jhf:#liferay> but forgot that to access any jars from WEB-INF/lib of Liferay you must declare it in your portal-plugin-package.properties file
12:27 <@jhf:#liferay> which causes it to get *copied* to your portlet’s classloader area when deployed
12:28 <@jhf:#liferay> and so while doing taht with portal-impl.jar is possible, it won’t be the same class instances that Liefray itself is using
12:29 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, I don't that is possible even. The deployment manager used to throw an exception when it found a reference to portal-impl.jar in the dependencies.
12:29 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah……….
12:29 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, DAMIT! back to the ext plugin for a solution I guess.
12:30 < jardineworks:#liferay> stupid maven...
12:30 <@jhf:#liferay> shut your mouth!
12:30 <@jhf:#liferay> maven rules
12:31 <@jhf:#liferay> Yam`: I know of no project named addresses.jsp
12:31 <@jhf:#liferay> there is likely a file somewhere in Liferay’s source code with that name though
12:31 <@jhf:#liferay> probably multiple files
12:32 < Yam`:#liferay> apparently we can use this file to do dependent combobox
12:32 < Yam`:#liferay> but I don't find a lot of help googling this
12:33 <@jhf:#liferay> I don’t know what a “dependent combobox” is
12:33 <@jhf:#liferay> could you explain that one?
12:34 < Yam`:#liferay> if I have two <select> or combo box, they're dependent if when I change the selected option of the first one, it changes the options of the second
12:34 < jardineworks:#liferay> bah maven has its moments where I like it but I since I am still learning it I prefer ANT.
12:34 <@jhf:#liferay> well I guess I don’t mind ant, what I do mind is having to copy a giant plugins sdk every time I want to create a tiny portlet
12:35 <@jhf:#liferay> so I really like having slimmed down projects with just a .pom
12:35 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, for example, I just created a maven ext project, and there are a million errors because all the dependencies need to be resovled.
12:35 <@jhf:#liferay> not a ton of unused directories full of build.xml crap
12:35 <@jhf:#liferay> well sure, they have to get downloaded first.
12:35 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, perhaps, but it is easy to modify the templates in the ANT world. You have to customize the archetypes to do it with Maven which is more painful.
12:36 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah
12:36 <@jhf:#liferay> I wonder if gradle is the answer to our prayers
12:36 < jardineworks:#liferay> right now I would settle for a link with a complete pom file with everyting I need to have the ext plugin shut the hell up :)
12:37 < jardineworks:#liferay> ah. missing properties.
12:37 < jardineworks:#liferay> partially..
12:41 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, no pom.xml for the core portal?
12:41 < jardineworks:#liferay> :(
12:41 <@jhf:#liferay> nope, cause we don’t use maven to build it (that I know of)
12:42 <@jhf:#liferay> I think some people are using gradle to build it.. I think.
12:42 <@jhf:#liferay> rotty3000 would know
12:42 <@jhf:#liferay> but …. he’s not here!!!
12:42 < jardineworks:#liferay> do you know what version of struts LR uses?
12:43 < jardineworks:#liferay> 1.2.8 seems to satisfy Maven
12:44 <@jhf:#liferay> LR uses 1.2.9
12:44 <@jhf:#liferay> https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/blob/master/lib/versions.xml#L3493
12:44 <@jhf:#liferay> well that is from master
12:44 < Yam`:#liferay> other thing, can I do a double c:forEach on a HashMap<Long, List<Something>>? what would be its syntax?
12:45 <@jhf:#liferay> for 6.2.. it’s… also 1.2.9 :)
12:50 < bijoo_:#liferay> Yam`: do you mean a nested forEach? of course?
12:50 < bijoo_:#liferay> Yam`: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5208671/nested-cforeach-in-jstl ?
12:51 < Yam`:#liferay> I'll try that bijoo_, I must leave, have a good day and thank you all
14:02 < jardineworks:#liferay> @_+)#@$!@!@$ MAVEN!
14:02 < jardineworks:#liferay> has anyone here built an EXT plugin using maven in 6.2?
14:15 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: I have, what's the issue that you're facing?
14:16 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo_, apart from hating it? :)
14:16 < jardineworks:#liferay> haha
14:16 < jardineworks:#liferay> just trying something give me one second and I'll tell you what is happening
14:16 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: okay, take your time; I'll be around then.
15:26 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo_, still there?
15:28 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: still here; what's the main issue facing?
15:32 < jardineworks:#liferay> first question -- not an issue really :)... is there a way to only show the one project in place of every single module?
15:32 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo_, ^^
15:32 < jardineworks:#liferay> it's like pollution for my IDE
15:36 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: there should only be few more deps for it.
15:36 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: how so? Like the ocean plastic dumping?
15:37 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: my bad; just saw your question above there.
15:37 < jardineworks:#liferay> lol
15:37 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: checking on that; give me couple minutes.
15:41 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo_, my first bit if annoyance with maven archteypes for ext is that it doesn't generate everything you need to have a clean project in eclipse.
15:41 < jardineworks:#liferay> for example /.... src/test/java for the ext-impl module.
15:41 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: yes I remember that; have to make dirs.
15:41 < jardineworks:#liferay> fail.
15:42 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: it's true, but it's a one-time cost here.
15:42 < jardineworks:#liferay> bah! NO COST WITH ANT!
15:42 < jardineworks:#liferay> :)
15:42 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: e.g. usually have few ext plugins.
15:42 < jardineworks:#liferay> I suppose
15:42 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: true but that's why we can make LPS :)
15:42 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: I'm sure ant scripts had glitches earlier
15:43 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo_, maybe... but there is little value add for my clients when I spend time doing this :)
15:43 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: so I'm setting up my maven here (haven't had to do so for two projects) so that I can follow what you're saying
15:44 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: agreed, these pitfalls why most still use ant
15:44 < jardineworks:#liferay> my client lives on the bleeding edge so I have no real choice here.
15:44 < jardineworks:#liferay> I call it a trail blazer tax.
15:44 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: :)
15:44 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: good one; I like analogies as well.
15:45 < jardineworks:#liferay> ok -- so I have those... and everything looks good. I haven't added anything yet though.
15:45 < jardineworks:#liferay> So I want to deploy this and it should work right? bsically I am deploying an EXT plugin with no overrides... it'll just put empty plumbing in place
15:45 < jardineworks:#liferay> does that sound right?
15:46 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: yes, sounds good there; empty's always good test.
15:46 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: then can add on little by little there.
15:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> alright -- and restart right? do these plugins still require a restart?
15:47 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo_, src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/sql' does not exist -> [Help 1] -- fail.. like seriously? that couldn't be fixed before release?
15:47 < jardineworks:#liferay> A FOLDER...
15:47 < jardineworks:#liferay> ?
15:48 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: haha, sounds like classic issue here.
15:48 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: create and it'll probably go past it.
15:48 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: I'm still getting my env setup here.
15:48 < jardineworks:#liferay> 9:47:26,187 INFO  [localhost-startStop-3][ExtHotDeployListener:170] Extension environment for ypg-shared-l10n-virtualhost-ext has been applied. You must reboot the server and redeploy all other plugins.
15:48 < jardineworks:#liferay> alright... rebooting
15:48 < jardineworks:#liferay> 5 shards so it'll take a minute anyway
15:49 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: haha, nice, how is the shard function there? Are you using custom sharding logic?
15:49 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: or using OOB Liferay logics (e.g. by instance or something, correct?)
15:50 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo_, just the default xml with a few extra definitions -- and then you pick the shard you want to be on when you create a new instance.
15:50 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: nice, glad the OOB works nicely there.
15:50 < jardineworks:#liferay> works pretty well, though deleting instances doesn't seem to work very well.
15:50 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: good point, I remember something on that.
15:50 < jardineworks:#liferay> which really sucks for me considering the changes I am making requires creating instances lol
15:50 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: does it not wipe all the data it should?
15:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo_, I have been getting a lot of just "Error"... a pretty JSP with the work ERROR and a back arrow
15:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> I go back, still there.
15:52 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: I see; related to instance delte?
15:52 < bijoo_:#liferay> delete*
15:52 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo_, I think so. There is nothing in the log so I assume RuntimeException somewhere... hate it when exceptions are gobbled.
15:53 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo_, right now that is not really my concern though. Did you see my conversation with jhf earlier about what I am trying to do?
15:53 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: I'll take a look at the logs; hold on sec.
15:53 < jardineworks:#liferay> multiple instance virtual hosts for a single instance.
15:53 < jardineworks:#liferay> so basically localized virtual hosts.
15:54 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: I remember you guys chatting on that.
15:54 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: so you want mysite.de point to the same instance as the mysite.fr but just have different locale?
15:54 < bijoo_:#liferay> same VirtualHost** not instanceb
15:54 < bijoo_:#liferay> instance*
15:54 < bijoo_:#liferay> Hmm nevermind I guess it's same instance;
15:55 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo_, not even... www.thisismyenglishsite.com for en_US, and then www.cacestdifferente.com for fr_CA for example.
15:55 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: go it, but the companyId be the same?
15:56 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo_, I could almost do it with hooks... and I might still be able to, but there is a lot of logic that goes into creating new companies.
15:56 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: one crazy idea: do all actions for both companies?
15:56 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo_, yeah. Right now the contraint (by default) is companyId and layoutSetId (for a VirtualHost)... I created a new table using SB called L10NVirtualHost that is the same, but adds a locale to the record. So uniqueness is companyId, layoutSetId, locale.
15:57 < jardineworks:#liferay> i tried all actions..
15:57 < jardineworks:#liferay> problem is
15:57 < jardineworks:#liferay> the EditInstanceAction forwards... and you need to do the originalStrutsAction logic first so that you can get the company id to add the L10NVirtualHost record.
15:58 < jardineworks:#liferay> but the EditInstanceAction orginalStrutsAction doesn't return, it forwards.
15:58 < jardineworks:#liferay> sooooo... looks like EXT with a few modification to the EditInstanceAction is step one.
15:58 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: nice, that makes sense; obviously you've tried.
15:58 < jardineworks:#liferay> I suppose the nice thing is that I can put all the changes, which there are A LOT OF in the same project.
15:59 < jardineworks:#liferay> I tried several things... desperately trying to avoid EXT lol
15:59 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: nice, that's what I would do as well.
15:59 < bijoo_:#liferay> ext tough
15:59 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: though with JRebel dev isn't too bad
16:00 < jardineworks:#liferay> I have JRebel.. but I still have to configure it.
16:00 < jardineworks:#liferay> do you use the embedded jar in eclipse? or do you use the agent?
16:00 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: do it ASAP; it'll be worth it.
16:00 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: I have used both (even with the remote)
16:00 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: they all work well; though embedded is nice.
16:01 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: since you just tick the box for the Server
16:01 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: no messing around in shell scripts and such
16:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> I used the agent when I was using it a year or so ago... I don't really like to run the app server from inside the IDE.. I like to tail the log.
16:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> I can't remember where to find the java agent though
16:01 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: I agree, that's what I usually do; but sometimes like to change things a little
16:02 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: it's in ~/.jrebel/
16:02 < jardineworks:#liferay> lemme check
16:02 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: nevermind, the agent is in plugins
16:02 < jardineworks:#liferay> boo! 20:01:02,013 ERROR [liferay/poller_response-2][ParallelDestination:72] Unable to process message {destinationName=liferay/poller_response, response=null, responseDestinationName=null, responseId=6134ba87-5abc-4cb3-a2b0-8a1c74294515, payload=com.liferay.portal.kernel.poller.DefaultPollerResponse@7f5eb3a2, values={companyId=15141}}

16:02 < jardineworks:#liferay> love it when random exceptions just start happening.
16:03 < jardineworks:#liferay> check out this one I had earlier lol --

16:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> oh... my bad'
16:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> lol
16:18 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo_, does the jrebel class reloading stuff work with exts as well? like right away? or only after you deploy? for example, I just added EditInstanceAction to my ext-impl project ... and in the log for the server I can see: INFO: Reloading Context with name [/ypg-shared-l10n-virtualhost-ext] is completed
16:18 < jardineworks:#liferay>  .. but does that override the core one immediately? no right?
16:18 < jardineworks:#liferay> i guess i could just try it lol
16:19 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: yes, that's why I said so no need reboot
16:19 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: I'm swapmed with something; I'll be back later
16:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> np -- thanks
17:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo_, do you ever have a problem with JRebel where the nature is in place but the saved changes are not automatically being deployed?
19:32 < bijoo__:#liferay> jardineworks: shuld work ; is rebel.xnl war deployed?
19:33 < bijoo__:#liferay> I'm on phone with a shoddy connection; I'll ping you later when back at my desk.
19:33 < bijoo__:#liferay> check war with rebel xml deployed
