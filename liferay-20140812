When i go to documents and media the categories are shown as they should... but when i go to an assetpublisher configured to show assets with those categories it doesnt show before i save the filentry as a new one in documents and media
08:13 < Yam`:#liferay> Hello!
08:14 < Yam`:#liferay> been a while! :D
08:14 < goku_:#liferay> @topolink : thanks
08:49 < Axxell:#liferay> topolik: care to analyze what is going wrong?
08:52 < Yam`:#liferay> I have a portlet with a select element. Can I do actions in my java code of my portlet when the user select an option?
08:52 < topolik:#liferay> Axxell: I'm sorry, I see the question now
08:52 < Yam`:#liferay> I didn't find how to do it
08:53 < topolik:#liferay> Axxell: I think it should be possible to include any portlet from ADT, depends on what everything is accessible from the velocity context
