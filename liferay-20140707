10:14 < jardineworks> does anyone in here use the LiferayFaces bridge with JSF porltets?
10:46 < goku_> hi,how to add javascript functionality in a create_user.jsp hook,exmaple i want to hide/show one input field based on the user selection on another select element
10:50 < jardineworks> goku_, Create a JSP hook for the create_user.jsp and add the js logic you want.
10:50 < sunny_> how can i integrate alfresco into liferay?
10:51 < sunny_> anyone pls helpme out?
10:52 < goku_> @jardineworks : so i have to create custome javascript writen on the create_user.jsp .. and write the js onselect handler for that particular element ,right?
10:53 < jardineworks> goku_, Have you make a hook project (first)?
10:53 < goku_> @jardineworks :  yea its created and the field is available in the create user page
10:54 < goku_> @jardineworks :  is that possible to show values on the input field on create_user.jsp from the DB ?
10:54 < sunny_> hi anyone pls helpme out
10:54 < sunny_> ?
10:54 < jardineworks> goku_, ok -- so then you have a hook project, and you have configured it to override the create_user.jsp file?
10:54 < goku_> @jardineworks :  yes
10:55 < jardineworks> goku_, ok... so yeah, just add the JS to that file and deploy it.
10:55 < goku_> @jardineworks :  thanks ..
10:55 < jardineworks> goku_, The poral will rename the original creat_user.jsp to create_user.jsp.portal, and then place your custom jsp in the same directory so that when the page is run, your custom file is returned.
10:55 < goku_> @jardineworks :  is that possible to get DB values on the custom input fields?
10:56 < jardineworks> goku_, can you give me an example?
10:57 < goku_> @jardineworks :  new customfiled is added for user (resource)..and i want to show it as a select box(values coming from DB not statically)?
