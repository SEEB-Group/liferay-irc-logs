10:14 < jardineworks> does anyone in here use the LiferayFaces bridge with JSF porltets?
10:46 < goku_> hi,how to add javascript functionality in a create_user.jsp hook,exmaple i want to hide/show one input field based on the user selection on another select element
10:50 < jardineworks> goku_, Create a JSP hook for the create_user.jsp and add the js logic you want.
10:50 < sunny_> how can i integrate alfresco into liferay?
10:51 < sunny_> anyone pls helpme out?
10:52 < goku_> @jardineworks : so i have to create custome javascript writen on the create_user.jsp .. and write the js onselect handler for that particular element ,right?
10:53 < jardineworks> goku_, Have you make a hook project (first)?
10:53 < goku_> @jardineworks :  yea its created and the field is available in the create user page
10:54 < goku_> @jardineworks :  is that possible to show values on the input field on create_user.jsp from the DB ?
10:54 < sunny_> hi anyone pls helpme out
10:54 < sunny_> ?
10:54 < jardineworks> goku_, ok -- so then you have a hook project, and you have configured it to override the create_user.jsp file?
10:54 < goku_> @jardineworks :  yes
10:55 < jardineworks> goku_, ok... so yeah, just add the JS to that file and deploy it.
10:55 < goku_> @jardineworks :  thanks ..
10:55 < jardineworks> goku_, The poral will rename the original creat_user.jsp to create_user.jsp.portal, and then place your custom jsp in the same directory so that when the page is run, your custom file is returned.
10:55 < goku_> @jardineworks :  is that possible to get DB values on the custom input fields?
10:56 < jardineworks> goku_, can you give me an example?
10:57 < goku_> @jardineworks :  new customfiled is added for user (resource)..and i want to show it as a select box(values coming from DB not statically)?
10:58 < jardineworks> sunny_, https://www.google.ca/search?q=liferay+and+alfresco+integration&oq=liferay+and+alfre&aqs=chrome.2.69i57j0l5.3452j0j7&sourceid=chrome&es_sm=93&ie=UTF-8
10:58 < jardineworks> goku_, you mean expando fields?
10:59 < sunny_> Thanks i will check that link
11:00 < goku_> @jardineworks :  sry its a typo..i mean i have created a custom field(which is select box) for a user creation page(its showing in create_user.js page).and i want to load the values to the selectbox from DB
11:02 < jardineworks> goku_, check out the <liferay-ui:custom-attribute-list /> tag
11:08 < goku_> @jardineworks : Thanks ,i read it.but the how to show values on these fields from DB its not given .. ?
11:10 < goku_> @jardineworks : is that possible to show values on these fields from DB ?.how to make a db connection on create_user.js and take values from DB ?
11:10 < jardineworks> create_user.js? or create_user.jsp? ... are you working with a Javascript file or a JSP file?
11:11 < Yam`> hello !
11:20 < goku_> @jardineworks : jsp file
11:21 < jardineworks> goku_, In that case, all you have to do is add a scriptlet <% ... %> with the code you need to get the values.
11:23 < goku_> @jardineworks : is there a liferay util class to get the DB values ..or is that possible to add the service jar from the service layer portlet and user the Util class for getting the values from DB ?
11:23 < goku_> @jardineworks : sry typo * user the Util class
11:23 < goku_> @jardineworks : sry typo * use the Util class
11:24 < jardineworks> goku_, when you say the service layer portlet, are you referring to a custom service builder portlet you have created?
11:29 < goku_> @jardineworks : yea
11:32 < Yam`> what's the best way to store custom webpage and use them in portlets? (in iframe or embedded page)
11:32 < jardineworks> goku_, yeah, but you need to move that jar out into the TOMCAT_HOME/lib/ext folder.
11:33 < goku_> @jardineworks : if i use that jar inside the hooks WEB-INF/lib folder..doesn't that work?
11:34 < jardineworks> goku_, you need to take it out of the hooks/WEB-INF lib and move it into the application servers global library
11:34 < jardineworks> (eg. TOMCAT_HOME/lib/ext)
11:35 < goku_> @jardineworks : ok,Thanks
11:35 < jardineworks> goku_, don't forget to restart :)
11:39 < goku_> @jardineworks : Yea.:),,one more doubt i have ..suppose i got the values from the DB..but in liferay-ui:custom-attribute-list tag i don't see any attribute for assigning that values to the List( i have seen attributes like className,classPk..etc)
11:42 < jardineworks> goku_, it will create the field with the values for you. Check out com.liferay.taglib.ui.CustomAttributeListTag from the portal source
11:45 < jardineworks> goku_, I think /html/taglib/ui/custom_attribute/page.jsp is what is used to render the tag.
11:45 < jardineworks> so you can see the logic for input type selection etc.
11:45 < goku_> @jardineworks : oh ok..
11:54 < goku_> @jardineworks : thanks man..i think i got what i need..thanks a lot for you help :)
11:59 < jardineworks> np
12:07 < lucas314> Hi there,
12:08 < lucas314> I'm trying to expose some webservices using liferay jsonws using CDI and JAX-RS. Anyone know some source or example of something like this?
12:18 -!- mode/#liferay [+o rotty3000] by ChanServ
12:58 < jardineworks> hey rotty3000 can I bug you for a second
14:02 < jardineworks> rotty3000, I have an instance. That instance has a site. Someone has gone into the site settings and set it to "Inactive" (basically unchecked the active checkbox). Becuase the site is the only one for the instance, I can no longer get into the instance to set the site to active again.
14:02 < jardineworks> rotty3000, do you know a work around by chance?
14:15 < jardineworks> apucay, any chance you have some ideas?
