03:08 < haba713:#liferay> hi! i'm trying to imlement a portlet using ajax to fill dropdowns etc. but when i add row
03:08 < haba713:#liferay> YUI().use('aui-io-request', 'node', function(Y) { });
03:08 < haba713:#liferay> to jsp, javascript initialization fails with some exception from everything.js
03:08 < haba713:#liferay> should liferay support this kind of implementation: http://alloyui.com/examples/io/real-world/
03:08 < haba713:#liferay> ?
04:07 < Yam`:#liferay> hi
07:16 < goku_:#liferay> hi how to add custom attributes for <ui:panel>
07:25 < goku_:#liferay> how to hide <ui:panel> initialy
08:26 < meera:#liferay> hi
09:07 < dave_k:#liferay> hmmm... any best practice hints to add user search criteria/field display for additional user data added via a "user extension" table from a plugin? So far: I need a hook that extends some JSPs in html/portlet/users_admin and /html/portlet/directory ... But what's the best way to access that data source from the other plugin?
09:40 < jardineworks:#liferay> need a maven guy -- bijoo  you around for a quick question?
09:44 < goku_:#liferay> hi any documentation on liferay projection ?
09:45 < jardineworks:#liferay> goku_, Liferay projection?
09:45 < goku_:#liferay> yea
09:45 < goku_:#liferay> jardineworks: yea
09:45 < jardineworks:#liferay> what do yo mean by that?
09:47 < goku_:#liferay> @jardinwworks :  i want to arrange the  columns in a particular order..so projection is the solution right ?
09:47 < goku_:#liferay> when retriving the content from DB
09:49 < goku_:#liferay> @jardinwworks :  but when i use projection list for that ..am getting class cast exception for the same Object  eg : for(SomeObject rb : ListOfSomeObject)
09:49 < goku_:#liferay> at this line am getting the class cast exception
09:50 < jardineworks:#liferay> goku_, I guess I am not familiar with the technical name for that. Normally when I want to order a list though I use a Comparator.
09:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> goku_, If you want to share the actual code, I can see if I see something though
10:02 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik1, you there buddy?
10:30 < bijoo:#liferay> jardineworks: hey I'm around (but not maven's maven :))
10:31 < bijoo:#liferay> jardineworks: I've used it as far as needed here.
10:31 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo, have you ever done a maven service builder project dependency for a hook
10:32 < bijoo:#liferay> jardineworks: so add mvn dependency for hook? to depend on service build mvn proj?
10:38 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo, I did that... groupid, artifactid and compile as the scope
10:38 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo, and it makes the pom happy
10:39 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo, but when I do a liferay:deploy ...I get an error.
10:53 < bijoo:#liferay> jardineworks: please pastebin the related files here
12:59 -!- mode/#liferay [+o jhf] by ChanServ
15:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey jhf are you around for a question?
15:04 <@jhf:#liferay> yup.. whats up?
15:04 <@jhf:#liferay> also did you see my request for bitnami :)
15:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, I did... and I wrote a reco :)
15:04 <@jhf:#liferay> !!!! sweet!
15:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, remember a few weeks back I was talking about i18n domain name support in Liferay?
15:05 <@jhf:#liferay> no, but several have asked and I thought it was a new feature in 6.2
15:06 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, it's supported at the page level.
15:06 < jardineworks:#liferay> so you can have www.mysite.com/home and www.mysite.com/maison
15:06 < jardineworks:#liferay> but both will load the same layout.
15:07 < jardineworks:#liferay> BUT
15:07 < jardineworks:#liferay> I am talking about www.french-mysite.com and www.english-mysite.com mapping to the same company/site.
15:07 <@jhf:#liferay> https://issues.liferay.com/browse/LPS-24594 says it’s fixed in 6.2… is that not the same thing as what you need?
15:07 <@jhf:#liferay> oh that’s probably talking about internationalized characters in domain names
15:08 < jardineworks:#liferay> no... probably more like locale based domain names
15:08 < jardineworks:#liferay> local specific domain names
15:08 < jardineworks:#liferay> now,
15:08 <@jhf:#liferay> so if I go to fr-company.com should I get the french content as well?
15:08 < jardineworks:#liferay> yeah
15:09 <@jhf:#liferay> ok. so you could do that externally, no? that is, have some redirection frmo fr-company.com to company.com/fr ?
15:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> so ... www.fre --> site A but with locale set to french... and www.eng --> site A but with english content.
15:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> ah se
15:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> see
15:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> that SEEMS reasonable.
15:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> but if you live in Canada you would know that the french folks here don't like english domain names :)
15:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> so basically I need to map TWO virtual host records to the same company id.
15:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> and then I guess with a hook, dynamically set the locale.
15:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> now, the question is...
15:10 <@jhf:#liferay> is it this: https://issues.liferay.com/browse/LPS-25449
15:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> almost
15:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> imagine this.
15:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> you create a new domain -- www.home.com
15:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> you want the french equivalent to be www.maison.com
15:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> but internally, both point to the same company/group
15:12 <@jhf:#liferay> but the URL can’t change right?
15:12 <@jhf:#liferay> lke, the address bar in the browser should remain www.maison.com no matter where you go
15:12 <@jhf:#liferay> so the canadians don’t get mad :)
15:13 < jardineworks:#liferay> bingo
15:13 < jardineworks:#liferay> lol
15:13 < jardineworks:#liferay> so!
15:14 < jardineworks:#liferay> the VirtualHost table in LR... it has an index constraint based on the finder method for both company and layoutsetid parameters
15:14 < jardineworks:#liferay> if you remove that constraint, then you can add multiple hostnames for the same company/layoutset pair.
15:15 < jardineworks:#liferay> so that would allow the -- create a new portal instance, specify multiple domains.
15:16 < jardineworks:#liferay> and then when I look at the VirtualHostPersistenceImpl class... the fetchVirtualHost method seems to consider the scenario where multiple records come back from the query and just chooses the first element in the list.
15:16 < jardineworks:#liferay> check out around line 430
15:16 < jardineworks:#liferay> oh  ... 6.2 EE
15:16 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah I think that’s just protective programming by someone, you’ll probably find that everywhere where their should only be 1 “but you never know” :)
15:17 < jardineworks:#liferay> ah! I see.. I am having a brain fart day man
15:17 < jardineworks:#liferay> jesus.
15:17 <@jhf:#liferay> wpw here’s a really old one: https://issues.liferay.com/browse/LEP-3228
15:17 <@jhf:#liferay> oh another one https://issues.liferay.com/browse/LPS-44217
15:18 <@jhf:#liferay> I think that would solve part of it - if you could have multiple virtual hosts
15:18 <@jhf:#liferay> then you could do the hook thingy
15:18 <@jhf:#liferay> wow there are a few suggestions in this area
15:18 < jardineworks:#liferay>  so but.. the virtual hosts... are those at the site level? or the company level?
15:18 <@jhf:#liferay> https://issues.liferay.com/issues/?jql=text%20~%20%22multiple%20virtual%20hosts%22
15:18 <@jhf:#liferay> hmmm
15:18 < jardineworks:#liferay> because I see the VirtaulHostLocalServiceUtil invoked by CompanyImpl and LayoutSetImpl
15:19 <@jhf:#liferay> LPS-44217 requests it on a per-site level
15:19 <@jhf:#liferay> o here’s another one: https://issues.liferay.com/browse/LPS-47906 :-)
15:19 < jardineworks:#liferay> but when a request comes into the server... doesn't it ge redirected to an instance based on the domain?
15:19 < jardineworks:#liferay> so wouldn't you need multiple hosts for a portal instance?
15:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> now that last one... that guy knows what he is talking about ;)
15:20 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah totally :)
15:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> haha
15:20 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah so I don’t think it’s possible with current Liferay
15:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> so that is what I am looking at
15:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> here's where I am confused.
15:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> I send in www.jhf.com ... Liferay tries to find a virtual host record with the hostname www.jhf.com .. and if it does, then it uses that company ID from that record to route the request right?
15:22 < jardineworks:#liferay> or does it route request based on a virtual host set on the site (group) record?
15:26 <@jhf:#liferay> I think it’s based on company, looking at https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/blob/66e0335c324751989b97f32acd51158c02ce6748/portal-impl/src/com/liferay/portal/servlet/filters/virtualhost/VirtualHostFilter.java (around line 267)
15:30 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, hmm... so I think the domain is used to get to the correct companyId records, and then the friendly url is used to map it to a site within the portal instance. Does that sound right?
15:33 <@jhf:#liferay> yup, that’s what I read.. that call to getPlidFromFriendlyURL seems to do that at https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/blob/6.2.x/portal-impl/src/com/liferay/portal/util/PortalImpl.java#L3655
15:48 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, still there!?
15:48 < jardineworks:#liferay> :)
15:48 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah
15:48 < jardineworks:#liferay> awesome... I totally forgot what I wanted to asl
15:48 < jardineworks:#liferay> ask
15:48 < jardineworks:#liferay> lol
15:48 < jardineworks:#liferay> when is the next dev life?
15:49 <@jhf:#liferay> heh
