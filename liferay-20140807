03:08 < haba713:#liferay> hi! i'm trying to imlement a portlet using ajax to fill dropdowns etc. but when i add row
03:08 < haba713:#liferay> YUI().use('aui-io-request', 'node', function(Y) { });
03:08 < haba713:#liferay> to jsp, javascript initialization fails with some exception from everything.js
03:08 < haba713:#liferay> should liferay support this kind of implementation: http://alloyui.com/examples/io/real-world/
03:08 < haba713:#liferay> ?
04:07 < Yam`:#liferay> hi
07:16 < goku_:#liferay> hi how to add custom attributes for <ui:panel>
07:25 < goku_:#liferay> how to hide <ui:panel> initialy
08:26 < meera:#liferay> hi
09:07 < dave_k:#liferay> hmmm... any best practice hints to add user search criteria/field display for additional user data added via a "user extension" table from a plugin? So far: I need a hook that extends some JSPs in html/portlet/users_admin and /html/portlet/directory ... But what's the best way to access that data source from the other plugin?
09:40 < jardineworks:#liferay> need a maven guy -- bijoo  you around for a quick question?
09:44 < goku_:#liferay> hi any documentation on liferay projection ?
09:45 < jardineworks:#liferay> goku_, Liferay projection?
09:45 < goku_:#liferay> yea
09:45 < goku_:#liferay> jardineworks: yea
09:45 < jardineworks:#liferay> what do yo mean by that?
09:47 < goku_:#liferay> @jardinwworks :  i want to arrange the  columns in a particular order..so projection is the solution right ?
09:47 < goku_:#liferay> when retriving the content from DB
09:49 < goku_:#liferay> @jardinwworks :  but when i use projection list for that ..am getting class cast exception for the same Object  eg : for(SomeObject rb : ListOfSomeObject)
09:49 < goku_:#liferay> at this line am getting the class cast exception
09:50 < jardineworks:#liferay> goku_, I guess I am not familiar with the technical name for that. Normally when I want to order a list though I use a Comparator.
09:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> goku_, If you want to share the actual code, I can see if I see something though
10:02 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik1, you there buddy?
10:30 < bijoo:#liferay> jardineworks: hey I'm around (but not maven's maven :))
10:31 < bijoo:#liferay> jardineworks: I've used it as far as needed here.
10:31 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo, have you ever done a maven service builder project dependency for a hook
10:32 < bijoo:#liferay> jardineworks: so add mvn dependency for hook? to depend on service build mvn proj?
10:38 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo, I did that... groupid, artifactid and compile as the scope
10:38 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo, and it makes the pom happy
10:39 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo, but when I do a liferay:deploy ...I get an error.
10:53 < bijoo:#liferay> jardineworks: please pastebin the related files here

15:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey jhf are you around for a question?
15:04 <@jhf:#liferay> yup.. whats up?
15:04 <@jhf:#liferay> also did you see my request for bitnami :)
15:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, I did... and I wrote a reco :)
15:04 <@jhf:#liferay> !!!! sweet!
15:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, remember a few weeks back I was talking about i18n domain name support in Liferay?
15:05 <@jhf:#liferay> no, but several have asked and I thought it was a new feature in 6.2
15:06 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, it's supported at the page level.
15:06 < jardineworks:#liferay> so you can have www.mysite.com/home and www.mysite.com/maison
15:06 < jardineworks:#liferay> but both will load the same layout.
15:07 < jardineworks:#liferay> BUT
15:07 < jardineworks:#liferay> I am talking about www.french-mysite.com and www.english-mysite.com mapping to the same company/site.
15:07 <@jhf:#liferay> https://issues.liferay.com/browse/LPS-24594 says it’s fixed in 6.2… is that not the same thing as what you need?
15:07 <@jhf:#liferay> oh that’s probably talking about internationalized characters in domain names
15:08 < jardineworks:#liferay> no... probably more like locale based domain names
15:08 < jardineworks:#liferay> local specific domain names
15:08 < jardineworks:#liferay> now,
15:08 <@jhf:#liferay> so if I go to fr-company.com should I get the french content as well?
15:08 < jardineworks:#liferay> yeah
15:09 <@jhf:#liferay> ok. so you could do that externally, no? that is, have some redirection frmo fr-company.com to company.com/fr ?
15:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> so ... www.fre --> site A but with locale set to french... and www.eng --> site A but with english content.
15:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> ah se
15:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> see
15:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> that SEEMS reasonable.
15:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> but if you live in Canada you would know that the french folks here don't like english domain names :)
15:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> so basically I need to map TWO virtual host records to the same company id.
15:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> and then I guess with a hook, dynamically set the locale.
15:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> now, the question is...
15:10 <@jhf:#liferay> is it this: https://issues.liferay.com/browse/LPS-25449
15:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> almost
15:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> imagine this.
15:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> you create a new domain -- www.home.com
15:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> you want the french equivalent to be www.maison.com
15:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> but internally, both point to the same company/group
15:12 <@jhf:#liferay> but the URL can’t change right?
15:12 <@jhf:#liferay> lke, the address bar in the browser should remain www.maison.com no matter where you go
15:12 <@jhf:#liferay> so the canadians don’t get mad :)
15:13 < jardineworks:#liferay> bingo
15:13 < jardineworks:#liferay> lol
15:13 < jardineworks:#liferay> so!
15:14 < jardineworks:#liferay> the VirtualHost table in LR... it has an index constraint based on the finder method for both company and layoutsetid parameters
15:14 < jardineworks:#liferay> if you remove that constraint, then you can add multiple hostnames for the same company/layoutset pair.
15:15 < jardineworks:#liferay> so that would allow the -- create a new portal instance, specify multiple domains.
