05:05 < modd_:#liferay> does anyone know wtf this is: https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/blob/6.2.x/portal-service/src/com/liferay/portal/kernel/jsonwebservice/JSONWebServiceNaming.java#L173-L174
09:59 < Guest1347:#liferay> hi, can anyone help me ? I'm running into problems while Unit testing my entities (built with Liferay Service Builder).I'm using powermockrunner to mock the static GetterUtil methods but they still fail with NPE in cinit for my entity fields (ENTITY_CACHE_ENABLED, ...). Any idea how to fix this ?

10:08 < jardineworks_:#liferay> Guest1347, Ugh. Unit testing in Liferay is very difficult... especially when you get down to the Utilities methods. Not that this necessarily helps, but I abandonned this dream a few weeks back. I recently found that SpringMock might be a possibility though because it allows you to load Spring context files -- so I thought that might solve issues like this one.
