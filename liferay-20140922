05:05 < modd_:#liferay> does anyone know wtf this is: https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/blob/6.2.x/portal-service/src/com/liferay/portal/kernel/jsonwebservice/JSONWebServiceNaming.java#L173-L174
09:59 < Guest1347:#liferay> hi, can anyone help me ? I'm running into problems while Unit testing my entities (built with Liferay Service Builder).I'm using powermockrunner to mock the static GetterUtil methods but they still fail with NPE in cinit for my entity fields (ENTITY_CACHE_ENABLED, ...). Any idea how to fix this ?

10:08 < jardineworks_:#liferay> Guest1347, Ugh. Unit testing in Liferay is very difficult... especially when you get down to the Utilities methods. Not that this necessarily helps, but I abandonned this dream a few weeks back. I recently found that SpringMock might be a possibility though because it allows you to load Spring context files -- so I thought that might solve issues like this one.
10:09 < jardineworks_:#liferay> Guest1347, In my case I was trying to use the PortalUtil... also with powermock.
10:09 < jardineworks_:#liferay> I couldn't mock it because, once I dug down, I found that some of the init methods try to read properties so I was getting easyConf exceptions.
10:10 < jardineworks_:#liferay> Guest1347, While trying to figure out how to solve it though i did come across a few blogs that talked specifically about unity testing service builder entities.
10:10 < jardineworks_:#liferay> Lemme see if I bookmarked any of them
10:12 < jardineworks_:#liferay> Guest1347, Here was one that I found -- https://www.liferay.com/community/wiki/-/wiki/Main/How+to+use+JUnit+to+test+service+in+portlets/maximized
10:14 < jardineworks_:#liferay> Guest1347, There was a better one, but apparently I failed to record it. Sorry.
10:21 < Guest1347:#liferay> thanks, i allready had a look at it and run into other problems... it's a pity that it is so difficult to test. it seems that testing is not a 1 class citizen in the world of liferay or at least the documentation is not clear. i try to figure it out and if successful i'll post about it
10:24 < jardineworks_:#liferay> Guest1347, That would be awesome. I also asked jhf if we could have a dev.life session with unit testing as a topic
10:25 <@jhf:#liferay> Guest1347: yeah you are spot-on: it's not documented well but there've been a lot of advancements (e.g. using Arquillian) and I am lining up a dev.life session on this topic.
10:29 < Guest1347:#liferay> I have seen the Arquillian part and that looks promising, but is it allready backported to 6.2 ? dev.life session would be perfect
10:30 <@jhf:#liferay> will find out if it's been backported.. my gut says no but you never know..
12:05 < argaldo:#liferay> hi
