15:06 < urug_:#liferay> There is a way to create plugin by extending another plugin. It's acomplished by copying plugin WAR and setting original.war.file property. But how can I extend built-in portlet like web form portlet??
15:17 < bijoo_:#liferay> urug_: the only way I know is through the Ext
15:18 < bijoo_:#liferay> urug_: the extending applies to standalones; I don't think it applies to OOB.
15:18 < bijoo_:#liferay> urug_: the ant script explodes the WAR for copy; but OOB don't have WAR for that.
15:42 < urug_:#liferay> bijoo_, thanks, I thought so ... do you think that creating new portlet usign sources from https://github.com/liferay/liferay-plugins/tree/6.2.x/portlets/web-form-portlet could be straithforward?
15:43 < modd:#liferay> yep, it is, we did it just last week exactly this way
15:43 < urug_:#liferay> ok i will give it a shot
15:47 < urug_:#liferay> can I export/import whole site?
15:49 < modd:#liferay> you can download the whole thing using this link: https://github.com/liferay/liferay-plugins/archive/6.2.x.zip
