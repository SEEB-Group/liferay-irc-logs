15:06 < urug_:#liferay> There is a way to create plugin by extending another plugin. It's acomplished by copying plugin WAR and setting original.war.file property. But how can I extend built-in portlet like web form portlet??
15:17 < bijoo_:#liferay> urug_: the only way I know is through the Ext
15:18 < bijoo_:#liferay> urug_: the extending applies to standalones; I don't think it applies to OOB.
15:18 < bijoo_:#liferay> urug_: the ant script explodes the WAR for copy; but OOB don't have WAR for that.
15:42 < urug_:#liferay> bijoo_, thanks, I thought so ... do you think that creating new portlet usign sources from https://github.com/liferay/liferay-plugins/tree/6.2.x/portlets/web-form-portlet could be straithforward?
15:43 < modd:#liferay> yep, it is, we did it just last week exactly this way
15:43 < urug_:#liferay> ok i will give it a shot
15:47 < urug_:#liferay> can I export/import whole site?
15:49 < modd:#liferay> you can download the whole thing using this link: https://github.com/liferay/liferay-plugins/archive/6.2.x.zip
15:53 < urug_:#liferay> I meant liferay site (community)
16:17 < urug_:#liferay> hm it's possible to export pages with content but the LAR archive does not contain categories, which are requiered for import, the thing is there i no way to export/import categories...
16:23 < bijoo_:#liferay> urug_: on the top of my head, I think that's right; I recall my team had to custom that.
16:23 < bijoo_:#liferay> urug_: https://www.liferay.com/marketplace/-/mp/application/27078617
16:24 < bijoo_:#liferay> "there is an app for that" in Marketplace
16:24 < bijoo_:#liferay> urug_: though it's for 6.1; can try update
17:22 < urug_:#liferay> Problem while saving web content with image: Caused by: java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: com/sun/image/codec/jpeg/ImageFormatException, happens only on production server, no problem on local devel machine... any ideas?
17:25 < urug_:#liferay> it's sun package dependency could OpenJDK be the problem?
17:25 < bijoo_:#liferay> urug_: yes, that is an internal API; if not using Sun JDK, happens; e.g. when using IBM or open one
17:25 < urug_:#liferay> ok, thanks
17:25 < bijoo_:#liferay> urug_: what's the caller restricted API? Is it Liferay code or some custom code?
