04:24 < bjornjohansson:#liferay> I'm not so much into security things but Liferay have the possibility to add Javascript to portletsâ€¦ isn't that adding a xss security flaw?
04:24 < bjornjohansson:#liferay> (i'm a newbie about security issues and just curious)
04:31 < topolik:#liferay> with good programing practices is using JS from portlets safe
04:31 < topolik:#liferay> JavaScript can create DOM based XSS
04:32 < topolik:#liferay> e.g. reading strings from URL and writing into HTML DOM
06:41 < AhmadElMelegy:#liferay> How can I override the Language.properties File of message board portlet ?
06:41 < AhmadElMelegy:#liferay> I want to rename the buttons
08:11 < rocknroll_:#liferay> you can create a hook and override the language strings

09:11 < mtsr:#liferay> Hi, quick question, I'm creating a new com.liferay.portal.kernel.mail.MailMessage, which I can set the subjet for fine, but as soon as I .setTo(new InternetAddress("aaa@bbb.com")) nothing more happens. My code doesn't run past that line.
10:19 < barrie:#liferay> Morning...
10:20 < barrie:#liferay> What is the best way to package an app for the MarketPlace that contains portlets, hooks and layouts?
10:20 < barrie:#liferay> portlets and hooks are easy.. but not sure on adding the layout
10:22 < barrie:#liferay> I'm guessing I could just include the appropriate files.. but not sure if the deployment would happen correctly
10:22 < barrie:#liferay> and if not.. how do you handle a MarketPlace app that may also have a theme involved? Is there a special packing that needs to be done?
