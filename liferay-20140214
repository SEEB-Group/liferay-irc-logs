04:24 < bjornjohansson:#liferay> I'm not so much into security things but Liferay have the possibility to add Javascript to portletsâ€¦ isn't that adding a xss security flaw?
04:24 < bjornjohansson:#liferay> (i'm a newbie about security issues and just curious)
04:31 < topolik:#liferay> with good programing practices is using JS from portlets safe
04:31 < topolik:#liferay> JavaScript can create DOM based XSS
04:32 < topolik:#liferay> e.g. reading strings from URL and writing into HTML DOM
06:41 < AhmadElMelegy:#liferay> How can I override the Language.properties File of message board portlet ?
06:41 < AhmadElMelegy:#liferay> I want to rename the buttons
08:11 < rocknroll_:#liferay> you can create a hook and override the language strings

09:11 < mtsr:#liferay> Hi, quick question, I'm creating a new com.liferay.portal.kernel.mail.MailMessage, which I can set the subjet for fine, but as soon as I .setTo(new InternetAddress("aaa@bbb.com")) nothing more happens. My code doesn't run past that line.
10:19 < barrie:#liferay> Morning...
10:20 < barrie:#liferay> What is the best way to package an app for the MarketPlace that contains portlets, hooks and layouts?
10:20 < barrie:#liferay> portlets and hooks are easy.. but not sure on adding the layout
10:22 < barrie:#liferay> I'm guessing I could just include the appropriate files.. but not sure if the deployment would happen correctly
10:22 < barrie:#liferay> and if not.. how do you handle a MarketPlace app that may also have a theme involved? Is there a special packing that needs to be done?
10:27 <@jhf:#liferay> hey barrie you can include any plugin types in a single app - they will all be deployed when the app is installed (though not in any particular order) - if there are inter-dependencies, be sure to declare them in the properties file
10:30 < barrie:#liferay> jhf: thanks.. I also found the docs at https://www.liferay.com/documentation/liferay-portal/6.1/development/-/ai/lp-6-1-dgen10-developing-and-publishing-apps-0 -- guess I should read them too :-)
10:30 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah, it's a good idea :)
10:30 <@jhf:#liferay> i've seen a few plugins that bundle more than one plugin type (namely Valamis) and things seem to get wired together properly
10:38 < barrie:#liferay> WHat's the latest on PACL for apps?
11:13 < AhmadElMelegy:#liferay> I created a hook to modify the buttons names of message boards but I don't know where to create my new language file
11:21 < barrie:#liferay> in your Hook (if using the IDE) you can pick  "New Liferay Hook COnfiguration" and there you can pick "Language Properties"
11:22 < AhmadElMelegy:#liferay> yes I did that
11:23 < AhmadElMelegy:#liferay> but where to put the new names of the message board buttons ?
11:23 < AhmadElMelegy:#liferay> barrie:
11:26 < barrie:#liferay> it should have created you files under WEB-INF/src/content
11:29 < AhmadElMelegy:#liferay> WEB-INF/src directory is empty
