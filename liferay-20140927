06:35 < Axxell:#liferay> hey guys, having a problem, apache redirect directives dont seem to work with liferay. I have apache 2.4 in front of liferay 6.2.. dont know if its an liferay issue
06:35 < Axxell:#liferay> do you guys know anything about redirects?
11:54 < urug_:#liferay> I can specify login page by overwriting auth.login.url=/web/guest/home in portla-ext.properties. But friendly page URLs are localized. So how does this suppose to work in localized environment.
12:18 < urug_:#liferay> Ok nevermind, If I change language it's redirected to right page.
12:22 < urug_:#liferay> OMG, but now I can't get the default behavior working again, even if I commet out auth.login.url= line in portlal-ext.properties
12:25 < urug_:#liferay> Firefox cache FTW
12:31 < urug_:#liferay> Why I can't add login portlet to page? It's greyed out in portlet selection.
12:36 < modd:#liferay> you can only add one instance to a page
12:36 < modd:#liferay> so if it's grey, it already is on that page
12:36 < modd:#liferay> however, if you don't see it, check maybe for permission problems
12:39 < urug_:#liferay> it's not in the page, unless it's somehow in the theme
12:40 < modd:#liferay> check your database..the login portlet will be listed for that page
12:41 < urug_:#liferay> And I have got Administrator role
12:42 < modd:#liferay> maybe you screwed something up^^
12:42 < modd:#liferay> easiest way: delete page, create new
12:42 < urug_:#liferay> No, the login portlet is embedded to the page
