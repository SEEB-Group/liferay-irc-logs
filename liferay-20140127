04:59 < wench_:#liferay> how to install 7 cogs on liferay 6.2
05:00 < wench_:#liferay> ??
11:18 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey topolik are you around for a quick question?
11:18 < jardineworks:#liferay> more of a feature availability than an actual problem to solve.
11:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik, The auditing feature of LR. Looking at the comparison matrix between EE and CE it seems to suggest that it is not available in CE. But I can see the filter flag in the portal-ext and I can see the Audit* objects in the portal source. So is the thing that is not available basically the nice portlet that allows you to review the audit records?
12:22 < centr0:#liferay> After deleting a theme, Liferay is still trying to reference this theme pushing warnings in catalina. WARN  [http-bio-8080-exec-95][ThemeLocalServiceImpl:149] No theme found for specified theme id summer_WAR_summertheme. Not allowing us to change the theme to a new one.  Any ideas on how to fix?
12:34 < jardineworks:#liferay> centr0, only way I have solved that one is to remove the references from the Layout table.
12:34 < jardineworks:#liferay> basically, go run an update setting the theme to blank ("") where the name is <bad theme id here>
12:52 < centr0:#liferay> jardineworks: Thanks! I'll look into it.
13:46 < wench_:#liferay> hi, i need to to boost the performance of liferay on tomcat
13:46 < wench_:#liferay> so what is the recommended config for that?
13:46 < wench_:#liferay> will increasing memory be enough?
14:13 < jardineworks:#liferay> wench_, There are several defacto things you can do ... let me see if I can find the link for you
