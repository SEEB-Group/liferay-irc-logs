06:18 < sm`:#liferay> hello
06:18 < sm`:#liferay> im having issues with connection pooling
06:19 < sm`:#liferay> it seems some of the apps/portlets are not closing connections or have transaction that hangs
06:19 < sm`:#liferay> is there a tool/way how i can monitor this and monitor the connections
06:19 < sm`:#liferay> we are using tomcat + liferay + c3p0 pooling
06:19 < sm`:#liferay> + oracle
07:52 < marrk:#liferay> hi, anyone can help me with qname -> setevent?
07:55 < marrk:#liferay> i got 2 pages, on the first one i set the event with actionResponse.setEvent(qname,"x") + redirect on the 2nd page, where i got a function with @ProcessEvent ("{...}..")  but this function is not called
08:01 < modd_:#liferay> ipc does work on the same page, not on 2 different pages
08:03 < modd_:#liferay> hey topolik1 - any liferay event at the moment, the whole liferay staff is missing here^^
08:04 < marrk:#liferay> modd_ : what else could i use in this case? do cookies work?
08:04 < modd_:#liferay> cookies are not bad for such things..or store it in the user session
08:04 < topolik1:#liferay> modd_: bingo ;)
08:06 < modd_:#liferay> party time at liferay inc?^^
08:07 < marrk:#liferay> modd_ : is there any way to do it so i could use different parameters on 2 different tabs?
08:09 < marrk:#liferay> for cookies: "response.addCookie(cookieParam);" its not working
08:10 < marrk:#liferay> but request.getcookies is possible.. weird :/
08:15 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Hey guys. Anyone here who has had problems with hooks not deploying correctly?
08:16 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> We have a hook that changes the top_head.jsp...and every now and then during a fresh deployment this hooks seems to be not applied correctly.
08:16 < marrk:#liferay> seems response.addProperty(cookieParam); is working:
08:25 < marrk:#liferay> In JSR-286 JSR 286 (Portlet 2.0) defines a lifecycle for events, so that eventing is possible between portlets that are in different web applications.
08:25 < marrk:#liferay> By adding the following property in portal-ext.properties, we can enable portlets to send and receive events from other portlets that are on different pages
08:25 < marrk:#liferay> modd_ : why cant i use this in my case?
08:37 < modd_:#liferay> which following property?
08:38 < modd_:#liferay> I'm not sure, ipc never worked on different pages but I didn't test deeper than just the baseball example portlet
08:38 < marrk:#liferay> http://www.liferay.com/de/community/wiki/-/wiki/Main/Portlet+to+Portlet+Communication?_36_pageResourcePrimKey=6629472
08:38 < marrk:#liferay>     portlet.event.distribution=layout-set
08:39 < marrk:#liferay> well its kinda important for me HOW portlet communicate, so cookies are working, but its not the way i want them to communicate

13:24 < modd:#liferay> hi jhf, how was the liferay party?^^
13:24 <@jhf:#liferay> party? what party!!
13:25 < modd:#liferay> well, I didn't see you for a while and I heard about some kind of event^^
13:27 <@jhf:#liferay> ah yeah I was traveling last 2 weeks, for EclipseCon and the "Open Source Think Tank" event
13:27 < modd:#liferay> ;)
13:27 <@jhf:#liferay> so i'm not sure booth duty is considered a party :) but it was fun nonetheless
13:28 < modd:#liferay> fun at work is important!
13:28 <@jhf:#liferay> got to hang out with rotty3000 so that was good
13:28 < modd:#liferay> right, he wasn't here neither
13:28 <@jhf:#liferay> now just writing a blog post for the big Mobile SDK release tomorrow
13:28 < modd:#liferay> cool, I'll read it ;)
13:29 < modd:#liferay> btw found some new problems with 6.2^^
13:29 <@jhf:#liferay> oh no... what now?
13:29 < modd:#liferay> today I've created one ticket
13:29 < modd:#liferay> adding pages in the frontend in IE8 doesn't work
13:29 < modd:#liferay> btw: the support matrix doesn't list sopported browsers anymore :\
13:30 < modd:#liferay> another problem, which I don't know if it's a problem, I wanted to talk about it with you
13:30 < modd:#liferay> some of my portlet localization doesn't work and I don't understand why
13:31 < modd:#liferay> using liferay-ui:message with keys from the portlet language.porperties works in normal jsps but in my config jsp it doesn't, if the key does not exist in the PORTAL language.properties
13:32 < modd:#liferay> in the java controller class it doesn't work at all using the language util
13:32 < modd:#liferay> and this seems to be new in 6.2
13:32 < modd:#liferay> I didn't find any similiar tickets or whatever
13:33 < modd:#liferay> but a collegue found the same problems so it can't be just me
14:50 < paranoid:#liferay> Hi, I have a problem. I have Liferay portal 6.2 and a vaadin portlet(usees vaadin charts) created in eclipse. I deployed war file from eclipse to deploy folder of liferay. when i add a portlet to liferay, the content says: widgetset com.caadin.defaultWidgetset does not contain implementation for com.vaaddin.addon.charts.Chart....
14:50 < paranoid:#liferay> I have installed Vaadin configuration addon for liferay and recompiled widgetset
14:51 < paranoid:#liferay> vaadin portlet without charts are shown normally
15:24 < Naenyn:#liferay> aw, no rotty..
15:33 < Naenyn:#liferay> jhf: what'd you do with raymond?
15:36 < Naenyn:#liferay> ah.. reading scrollback, I see he was at a conference? hope he returns soon, I have hook questions. =]
15:36 <@jhf:#liferay> hahah I think he's traveling again this week. might be on at odd hours :)
15:37 < modd:#liferay> odd hours? great! these are the hours I'm on^^
15:37 < Naenyn:#liferay> wish there were more liferay staffers here. especially technical folks.
15:37 < Naenyn:#liferay> lo;l
15:37 < Naenyn:#liferay> lol even
15:37 < modd:#liferay> more people of this timezone
15:52 <@jhf:#liferay> IRC (i.e. realtime chat) is not for everyone :) some people prefer forums, stack overflow, etc.
15:53 <@jhf:#liferay> but yeah I wish there were more staffers here too :)
15:53 <@jhf:#liferay> there will be soon, though, I am planning on starting a regular developer hangout (e.g. google hangout) and using IRC as the main way to participate.
15:53 < modd:#liferay> irc is imo an important part of the life of a programmer
15:57 < modd:#liferay> jhf: I'll try to provide an example portlet with the localization problems I have, but for now it's time to go to sleep. ;)
15:57 < modd:#liferay> gn8!
