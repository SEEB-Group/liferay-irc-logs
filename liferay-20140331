06:18 < sm`:#liferay> hello
06:18 < sm`:#liferay> im having issues with connection pooling
06:19 < sm`:#liferay> it seems some of the apps/portlets are not closing connections or have transaction that hangs
06:19 < sm`:#liferay> is there a tool/way how i can monitor this and monitor the connections
06:19 < sm`:#liferay> we are using tomcat + liferay + c3p0 pooling
06:19 < sm`:#liferay> + oracle
07:52 < marrk:#liferay> hi, anyone can help me with qname -> setevent?
07:55 < marrk:#liferay> i got 2 pages, on the first one i set the event with actionResponse.setEvent(qname,"x") + redirect on the 2nd page, where i got a function with @ProcessEvent ("{...}..")  but this function is not called
08:01 < modd_:#liferay> ipc does work on the same page, not on 2 different pages
08:03 < modd_:#liferay> hey topolik1 - any liferay event at the moment, the whole liferay staff is missing here^^
08:04 < marrk:#liferay> modd_ : what else could i use in this case? do cookies work?
08:04 < modd_:#liferay> cookies are not bad for such things..or store it in the user session
08:04 < topolik1:#liferay> modd_: bingo ;)
08:06 < modd_:#liferay> party time at liferay inc?^^
08:07 < marrk:#liferay> modd_ : is there any way to do it so i could use different parameters on 2 different tabs?
08:09 < marrk:#liferay> for cookies: "response.addCookie(cookieParam);" its not working
08:10 < marrk:#liferay> but request.getcookies is possible.. weird :/
