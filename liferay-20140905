04:41 < Axxell:#liferay> anyone feel like helping me make my portlet searchable?
04:42 < Axxell:#liferay> would really appreciate
04:42 < Axxell:#liferay> it
05:03 < Axxell:#liferay> i get a nullpointerexception when reindexing in searchpermissioncheckerimpl
05:05 < Axxell:#liferay> i do a searchengineutil.updateDocuments
05:19 < Axxell:#liferay> anyone?
05:50 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> sorry can't help you with that
06:36 < Axxell:#liferay> anybody else feel like helping
06:46 < Axxell:#liferay> anyone else?
07:12 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> hi there
07:13 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> got an error on deployment (6.1.2) that fmt_rt cannot be resolved in web.xml or in jar files... any advice on which dependency I'm missing ?
08:49 < dave_k:#liferay> Hey all ... In a custom portlet, I have multiple filter inputs to search for Users using LazyLoading for pagination. Now I want to add an organization filter -- i.e. search for Users that are in a certain organization. Doing this via OrganizationLocalServiceUtil.search() breaks LazyLoading... I need a method to ask the DB to do the combined filtering for me. What are my options here?
10:20 < jardineworks_:#liferay> dave_k, what about a dynamic query?
10:22 < jardineworks_:#liferay> though dynamic queries don't provide any caching (I think)
10:22 < jardineworks_:#liferay> the nice thing about the *LocalServiceUtil is that they do.
10:40 < dave_k:#liferay> jardineworks_: Dunno about that... need to check it. At least I got a keyword now :)
