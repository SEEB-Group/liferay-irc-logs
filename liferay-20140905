04:41 < Axxell:#liferay> anyone feel like helping me make my portlet searchable?
04:42 < Axxell:#liferay> would really appreciate
04:42 < Axxell:#liferay> it
05:03 < Axxell:#liferay> i get a nullpointerexception when reindexing in searchpermissioncheckerimpl
05:05 < Axxell:#liferay> i do a searchengineutil.updateDocuments
05:19 < Axxell:#liferay> anyone?
05:50 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> sorry can't help you with that
06:36 < Axxell:#liferay> anybody else feel like helping
06:46 < Axxell:#liferay> anyone else?
07:12 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> hi there
07:13 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> got an error on deployment (6.1.2) that fmt_rt cannot be resolved in web.xml or in jar files... any advice on which dependency I'm missing ?
08:49 < dave_k:#liferay> Hey all ... In a custom portlet, I have multiple filter inputs to search for Users using LazyLoading for pagination. Now I want to add an organization filter -- i.e. search for Users that are in a certain organization. Doing this via OrganizationLocalServiceUtil.search() breaks LazyLoading... I need a method to ask the DB to do the combined filtering for me. What are my options here?
10:20 < jardineworks_:#liferay> dave_k, what about a dynamic query?
10:22 < jardineworks_:#liferay> though dynamic queries don't provide any caching (I think)
10:22 < jardineworks_:#liferay> the nice thing about the *LocalServiceUtil is that they do.
10:40 < dave_k:#liferay> jardineworks_: Dunno about that... need to check it. At least I got a keyword now :)
10:41 < jardineworks_:#liferay> dave_k, also, if you have both Users and Organizations being indexed in Lucene, you might be able to do what you are doing by using BooleanQuery searches
10:41 < dave_k:#liferay> jardineworks_: I already dropped index search for substring matching...
10:42 < jardineworks_:#liferay> dave_k, for substring matching? meaning you need to do it and don't feel you can with search?
10:42 < jardineworks_:#liferay> because you can :)
10:43 < dave_k:#liferay> jardineworks_: interesting. because the primefaces4-users-portlet code has a comment stating it doesn't
10:45 < dave_k:#liferay> jardineworks_: anyway, I could not find any searchCount() for the search index. that broke my pagination.
10:45 < jardineworks_:#liferay> dave_k, well, it's wrong. YOu can do wildcard searches in lucene.... what good is a search engine that only works with EXACT matches!
10:46 < jardineworks_:#liferay> searchContext.setStart() and searchContext.setEnd() I think... but you would need a index.getHitCount() I think it is?
10:46 < jardineworks_:#liferay> for the totla.
10:46 < jardineworks_:#liferay> I mean
10:47 < jardineworks_:#liferay> dave_k, anyway, point is that there is always more than one way to do something in LR :)
10:48 < dave_k:#liferay> half exact. I used the indexer version of UserLocalServiceUtil.search() with start and end arguments, but the searchCount() mismatched if I used wildcards.
10:49 < dave_k:#liferay> jardineworks_: see also https://issues.liferay.com/browse/LPS-49744
