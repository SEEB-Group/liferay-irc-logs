09:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey bijoo -- lemme know when you make it into the office
09:15 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: hey I'm here; debug shutdown correct?
09:26 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo_, give me 5 minutes and I'll give you the background on everything
09:27 < jardineworks:#liferay> just need to wrap up a section of a tutorial quick..
09:40 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: take your time my day's getting swamped right now
09:49 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo_, Alright.. a little reading material. My current client wants to have some extended HA Fail over. What we have in an environment where there are two Liferay installations -- serverA and serverB with your typical proxy fronting as a load balancer. serverA and serverB are unicast Liferay clustered so ehcache and lucene are kept in synch. The proxy is using sticky session with a non-JVM route... the proxy basically uses it
09:49 < jardineworks:#liferay> s own cookie. So far all that is good. For added HA though what we have done is clustered (tomcat clustered that is) the two servers leveraging the tribes stuff that comes with the platform. The membership discovery and heart beat is done using a multicast. We've also configure the DetalManager for session replication -- the idea being that if I am half way through a payment process on server A and for some reason it goes down
09:49 < jardineworks:#liferay> , I am bumped to server B but my session is still in tact so I continue along. All of this works -- painful to setup, but it works. Now, if I disable a server in apache (load balancer) using the balancer-manager it works. If I kill -9 the liferay process -- it works. BUT if I shutdown the server using the graceful shutdown process, lets say I shutdown A, then in server B I see a tribes message that comes across with a SESSION-
09:49 < jardineworks:#liferay> EXPIRE message. The delta manager has expireSessionsOnShutdown="false" set which is supposed to prevent this action from happening. At first I thought perhaps it was a bug in tomcat. So I installed and clustered two vanilla tomcat 7.0.42 servers. I tried the same test and the SESSION-EXPIRE was not sent. So at this stage I am thinkiing that it is something in LR. So the question is...IS THERE A LISTENER IN LR THAT IS WIRED TO
09:50 < jardineworks:#liferay> THE _SERVER_ SHUTDOWN PROCESS? and if there is, do you know what it is?
09:50 < jardineworks:#liferay> </end-of-story>
09:50 < jardineworks:#liferay> :)
10:00  * bijoo_:#liferay is reading
10:04 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: okay; yes, probably there is something. Looking at portal.properties file:
10:05 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: global.shutdown.events=com.liferay.portal.events.GlobalShutdownAction
10:05 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: application.shutdown.events=com.liferay.portal.events.AppShutdownAction,com.liferay.portal.events.ChannelHubAppShutdownAction
10:05 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: shutdown.programmatically.exit=false
10:06 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: these may not be the only check places; also way to shutdown via UI; good to check what that calls in the backend; and start the debugger with breakpoint there.
10:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo_, Right -- I saw those classes and had a quick look at them but didn't see anything. I'll take a closer look at them. I have a test portlet called "session-replication-test" and the message contains it as the context (since I guess it is the one with the only active session). I am wondering if during shutdown, the unregister actions trigger somehting in those portlets to cause a session expire BEFORE the server shutsdown
10:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> . Know what I mean?
10:11 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: yes, so good candidate to debug there.
10:12 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: it takes time to debug, but I like it; since it gives all information I need.
10:12 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: have you tried stepping through that process yet?
10:17 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo_, not yet but I guess that'll be my next step. other "priorities" have come up though :)
10:17 < jardineworks:#liferay> I was just wondering if you knew already :)
10:22 -!- mode/#liferay [+o jhf] by ChanServ
10:27 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo_, since you are a maven guy and I am a n00b to maven.. I have a maven question for you. When generating the war files, is there a way to add an incremental build number? I saw something last night about mojo?
10:27 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: I've never had one shutdown kill sessions; best to step through the code to double-check.
10:30 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: I've used maven on some projects before; but I'm no way a maven of maven; though I recall auto-increment there; maybe http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9554688/maven-versioning-best-practices ?
10:30 <@jhf:#liferay> hurray, elasticsearch plugin https://github.com/R-Knowsys/elasticray I think this will eventually be polished into a marketplace plugin
10:33 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, AWESOME. I was actually looking to do that! happy to see someone else already has :)
10:33 < jardineworks:#liferay> but ... I thought I saw ES Impls as part of the Liferay Master branch?
10:33 < jardineworks:#liferay> or maybe it was in the liferay-plugins...
10:34 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah ya know I thought I heard that too. gonna go find out if we have one internally already
10:34 <@jhf:#liferay> oh I remember
10:34 <@jhf:#liferay> we are moving to elasticsearch as the default OOTB search in Liferay 7
10:35 <@jhf:#liferay> but thatâ€™s at least a year out
10:35 <@jhf:#liferay> so this plugin will be obsolete then :)
10:35 <@jhf:#liferay> but still useful for 6.2!
10:35 < jardineworks:#liferay> hahah for sure
10:35 < jardineworks:#liferay> Liferay 7 a year out
10:35 < jardineworks:#liferay> ?
10:35 < jardineworks:#liferay> :(
10:54 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: so LR7 a major release; I'd rather wait and give them enough time; I mean 6.2's already jam-packed.
10:58 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo_, I guess... I'm just excited about the whole OSGi piece and rumors that you could make the portal lightweight enough that you could embed it in something like... a tablet, or a phone :)
11:00 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: me too; it'll take lots to do that here. Imagine 100+ portlets need change.
11:01 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: I'm not suprprised if it takes some phases; so LR7 does part of the way; e.g. some portlets get converted there.
11:01 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: I can't wait to read more on the OSGi
11:01 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: been too busy working "emergencies" ;)
11:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo_, same here. Are you heading to the symposium in october?
11:05 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: I am; extra looking forward to it.
11:06 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo_, Cool! I am going to attend to... my first.
11:06 < bijoo_:#liferay> :)
11:06 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: great, we'll have to meet in person there thene.
11:06 < bijoo_:#liferay> then*
11:07 < jardineworks:#liferay> definitely
11:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> stupid sprouts. I wanted to present a case study but their CIO is a dick.
11:18 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: hehe, always room for following year.
11:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo_, I should have spoken with the CMO... who doesn't like free press?!
11:58 <@jhf:#liferay> hah
11:58 <@jhf:#liferay> osgi is only one of the big changes - the other is support for SPA (single page applications)
12:00 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, :O
12:00 <@jhf:#liferay> yup
12:01 <@jhf:#liferay> portlets written today will magically become fully ajaxified and awesome with no changes in 7
