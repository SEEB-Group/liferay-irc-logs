09:49 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo_, Alright.. a little reading material. My current client wants to have some extended HA Fail over. What we have in an environment where there are two Liferay installations -- serverA and serverB with your typical proxy fronting as a load balancer. serverA and serverB are unicast Liferay clustered so ehcache and lucene are kept in synch. The proxy is using sticky session with a non-JVM route... the proxy basically uses it

For added HA though what we have done is clustered (tomcat clustered that is) the two servers leveraging the tribes stuff that comes with the platform. The membership discovery and heart beat is done using a multicast. We've also configure the DetalManager for session replication -- the idea being that if I am half way through a payment process on server A and for some reason it goes down
