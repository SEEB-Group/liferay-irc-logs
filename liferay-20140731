09:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey bijoo -- lemme know when you make it into the office
09:15 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: hey I'm here; debug shutdown correct?
09:26 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo_, give me 5 minutes and I'll give you the background on everything
09:27 < jardineworks:#liferay> just need to wrap up a section of a tutorial quick..
09:40 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: take your time my day's getting swamped right now
09:49 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo_, Alright.. a little reading material. My current client wants to have some extended HA Fail over. What we have in an environment where there are two Liferay installations -- serverA and serverB with your typical proxy fronting as a load balancer. serverA and serverB are unicast Liferay clustered so ehcache and lucene are kept in synch. The proxy is using sticky session with a non-JVM route... the proxy basically uses it
09:49 < jardineworks:#liferay> s own cookie. So far all that is good. For added HA though what we have done is clustered (tomcat clustered that is) the two servers leveraging the tribes stuff that comes with the platform. The membership discovery and heart beat is done using a multicast. We've also configure the DetalManager for session replication -- the idea being that if I am half way through a payment process on server A and for some reason it goes down
09:49 < jardineworks:#liferay> , I am bumped to server B but my session is still in tact so I continue along. All of this works -- painful to setup, but it works. Now, if I disable a server in apache (load balancer) using the balancer-manager it works. If I kill -9 the liferay process -- it works. BUT if I shutdown the server using the graceful shutdown process, lets say I shutdown A, then in server B I see a tribes message that comes across with a SESSION-
09:49 < jardineworks:#liferay> EXPIRE message. The delta manager has expireSessionsOnShutdown="false" set which is supposed to prevent this action from happening. At first I thought perhaps it was a bug in tomcat. So I installed and clustered two vanilla tomcat 7.0.42 servers. I tried the same test and the SESSION-EXPIRE was not sent. So at this stage I am thinkiing that it is something in LR. So the question is...IS THERE A LISTENER IN LR THAT IS WIRED TO
09:50 < jardineworks:#liferay> THE _SERVER_ SHUTDOWN PROCESS? and if there is, do you know what it is?
09:50 < jardineworks:#liferay> </end-of-story>
09:50 < jardineworks:#liferay> :)
10:00  * bijoo_:#liferay is reading
10:04 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: okay; yes, probably there is something. Looking at portal.properties file:
10:05 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: global.shutdown.events=com.liferay.portal.events.GlobalShutdownAction
10:05 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: application.shutdown.events=com.liferay.portal.events.AppShutdownAction,com.liferay.portal.events.ChannelHubAppShutdownAction
10:05 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: shutdown.programmatically.exit=false
10:06 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: these may not be the only check places; also way to shutdown via UI; good to check what that calls in the backend; and start the debugger with breakpoint there.
10:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo_, Right -- I saw those classes and had a quick look at them but didn't see anything. I'll take a closer look at them. I have a test portlet called "session-replication-test" and the message contains it as the context (since I guess it is the one with the only active session). I am wondering if during shutdown, the unregister actions trigger somehting in those portlets to cause a session expire BEFORE the server shutsdown
10:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> . Know what I mean?
10:11 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: yes, so good candidate to debug there.
10:12 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: it takes time to debug, but I like it; since it gives all information I need.
10:12 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: have you tried stepping through that process yet?
10:17 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo_, not yet but I guess that'll be my next step. other "priorities" have come up though :)
10:17 < jardineworks:#liferay> I was just wondering if you knew already :)
10:22 -!- mode/#liferay [+o jhf] by ChanServ
10:27 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo_, since you are a maven guy and I am a n00b to maven.. I have a maven question for you. When generating the war files, is there a way to add an incremental build number? I saw something last night about mojo?
10:27 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: I've never had one shutdown kill sessions; best to step through the code to double-check.
10:30 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: I've used maven on some projects before; but I'm no way a maven of maven; though I recall auto-increment there; maybe http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9554688/maven-versioning-best-practices ?
10:30 <@jhf:#liferay> hurray, elasticsearch plugin https://github.com/R-Knowsys/elasticray I think this will eventually be polished into a marketplace plugin
10:33 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, AWESOME. I was actually looking to do that! happy to see someone else already has :)
10:33 < jardineworks:#liferay> but ... I thought I saw ES Impls as part of the Liferay Master branch?
10:33 < jardineworks:#liferay> or maybe it was in the liferay-plugins...
10:34 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah ya know I thought I heard that too. gonna go find out if we have one internally already
10:34 <@jhf:#liferay> oh I remember
10:34 <@jhf:#liferay> we are moving to elasticsearch as the default OOTB search in Liferay 7
10:35 <@jhf:#liferay> but that’s at least a year out
10:35 <@jhf:#liferay> so this plugin will be obsolete then :)
10:35 <@jhf:#liferay> but still useful for 6.2!
10:35 < jardineworks:#liferay> hahah for sure
10:35 < jardineworks:#liferay> Liferay 7 a year out
10:35 < jardineworks:#liferay> ?
10:35 < jardineworks:#liferay> :(
10:54 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: so LR7 a major release; I'd rather wait and give them enough time; I mean 6.2's already jam-packed.
10:58 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo_, I guess... I'm just excited about the whole OSGi piece and rumors that you could make the portal lightweight enough that you could embed it in something like... a tablet, or a phone :)
11:00 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: me too; it'll take lots to do that here. Imagine 100+ portlets need change.
11:01 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: I'm not suprprised if it takes some phases; so LR7 does part of the way; e.g. some portlets get converted there.
11:01 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: I can't wait to read more on the OSGi
11:01 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: been too busy working "emergencies" ;)
11:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo_, same here. Are you heading to the symposium in october?
11:05 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: I am; extra looking forward to it.
11:06 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo_, Cool! I am going to attend to... my first.
11:06 < bijoo_:#liferay> :)
11:06 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: great, we'll have to meet in person there thene.
11:06 < bijoo_:#liferay> then*
11:07 < jardineworks:#liferay> definitely
11:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> stupid sprouts. I wanted to present a case study but their CIO is a dick.
11:18 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: hehe, always room for following year.
11:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo_, I should have spoken with the CMO... who doesn't like free press?!
11:58 <@jhf:#liferay> hah
11:58 <@jhf:#liferay> osgi is only one of the big changes - the other is support for SPA (single page applications)
12:00 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, :O
12:00 <@jhf:#liferay> yup
12:01 <@jhf:#liferay> portlets written today will magically become fully ajaxified and awesome with no changes in 7
12:03 <@jhf:#liferay> and, you’ll be able to write apps using modern web development frameworks like angular, ember, and pkg management like bower
12:04 <@jhf:#liferay> alongside “true” (JSR-based) portlets with ancient portlet.xml files
12:05 <@jhf:#liferay> soooooooo.. yeah.. takes a bit of time (although SPA phase 1 is there now: https://issues.liferay.com/browse/LPS-45853)
12:11 < bijoo_:#liferay> SPA sounds really interesting
12:12 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: haha, good point; I'm in similar path.
12:12 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: client has interesting story there; from custom to Liferay type transition.
12:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, those magic portlets... those are MVCPortlets I assume?
12:27 < dave_k:#liferay> hey all ... a question about liferay registration workflow. We enabled the email verification process, but now liferay is sending out two mails: one with a temporary password, one with the verification link. The mail with the temp-password seems a bit redundant... is it possible to configure liferay to ONLY send the verification link and then, after the new user clicked it, directly ask for a new password?
12:28 <@jhf:#liferay> doesn’t matter how they are built. if they are JSR-286-compliant or liferay-compliant portlets, they will benefit.. for example portlet action URLs are often HTTP POST’d to, causing full page refershes.. but now they will magically be converted to a JS function call into some kind of Liferay client-side proxy thingy (kinda like what is being proposed for portlet 3 spec, and that Vaadin has been doing for a decade)
12:28 <@jhf:#liferay> that’s just one part of it
13:00 < bijoo_:#liferay> dave_k: that is probably for security; some say pass should be separate email.
13:02 < dave_k:#liferay> bijoo_: hmm? the pass should not be sent via mail.
13:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, any details on a release scheduel? I mean an RC1 for example?
13:13 <@jhf:#liferay> lol “release schedule”
13:14 <@jhf:#liferay> so I am expecting a first *milestone build* this fall, in time for our symposiums
13:14 <@jhf:#liferay> that means, in october sometime
13:14 <@jhf:#liferay> but that’s just a milestone, at which point we’ll also kick off a community bugsquad team program to start working with it
13:14 <@jhf:#liferay> which I highly recommend everyone here get super active in! :)
13:15 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, I'd happily join in on that
13:19 -!- mode/#liferay [+o rotty3000] by ChanServ
13:20 < bijoo_:#liferay> dave_k: I don't see any properties for it; only ones I see are for the templates:
13:20 < bijoo_:#liferay> dave_k: admin.email.password.reset.subject
13:20 < bijoo_:#liferay> dave_k: admin.email.password.reset.body
13:20 < bijoo_:#liferay> admin.email.password.sent.subject
13:20 < bijoo_:#liferay> admin.email.password.sent.body
13:21 < bijoo_:#liferay> admin.email.verification.subject ...
13:23 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo_, dave_k maybe something that can be overriden with a Struts Hook
13:23 < dave_k:#liferay> bijoo_: thx, but these aren't interesting... I'm currently trying the combination of company.security.strangers.verify=true; login.create.account.allow.custom.password=true; passwords.default.policy.change.required=false to approximate the outlined behaviour ... but still, the new user has to set his password with the registration form, not after verification. it's roughly equivalent, I guess...
13:24 < dave_k:#liferay> jardineworks: yeah, but we're trying to avoid that :)
13:31 < jardineworks:#liferay> dave_k, seems like avoiding it is taking longer than the hook would to write :)
13:42 < dave_k:#liferay> jardineworks: Nope. writing the hook would require diving into a part of the API I don't know yet.
13:46 < sam____:#liferay> Hey guys, I am creating a theme and wanted to have more than 1 portlet drop area on a page; in other words, I'd like to be able to drag and drop portlets to a section at the top of the page, have a central HTML element, and a portlet drop area below it (check this fiddle: http://goo.gl/ftLhT4). Does anyone know how to do it? tks

14:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> sam____, I would create a layout with three two drop zoned... and in between have your static content or your embeded portelt that pulls the static content. The box that surrounds those three rectangles would be the theme portion of the page.
14:06 < jardineworks:#liferay> sorry... the box around the rectangles is the layout, the box around the box is the theme :)
14:08 < jardineworks:#liferay> sam____, so a layout plugin with something like this -- http://pastie.org/9434869
14:11 < bijoo_:#liferay> sam____: right per jardineworks that's layout template
14:12 < sam____:#liferay> thank you guys
14:13 < sam____:#liferay> the content I want to have in between portlet drop zones is actually going to be my site's navbar
14:13 < sam____:#liferay> so I'd need to have access to the nav_items variable
14:13 < sam____:#liferay> it is available at a theme level; I am not sure if it is at a layout level. Do you know if it is?
14:17 < jardineworks:#liferay> sam____, if you have a look at the navigation.vm (assuming you are using velocity templates for your theme) I think the variable is called $navItems. It might be scoped high enough. If not, then check out some of the init.vm files from the portal source and you can probably find the code that grabs it in the theme and put it into your layout template.
14:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> sam____, if you have the _unstyled as your parent -- then check out the init.vm from that theme folder -- there are a couple of lines --
