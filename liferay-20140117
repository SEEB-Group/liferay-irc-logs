05:22 < nicollas_FR:#liferay> hi there
06:01 < Axxell:#liferay> hey guys im trying to do the following velocity thingy in freemarker: #set($footer-content=$journalContentUtil.getContent($axxellCompany, $footer-content-id ,null,"$locale",$theme_display))
06:01 < Axxell:#liferay> but i cant get it to work..
06:01 < Axxell:#liferay> <#assign footercontent = journalContentUtil.getContent(axxellCompany, footercontentid ,null,"locale",theme_display) />
06:01 < Axxell:#liferay> thats im using in freemarker
06:27 <@jhf:#liferay> Axxell: how did you define footercontentid  ?
06:29 <@jhf:#liferay> also, what error are you getting?
08:04 < Axxell:#liferay> jhf: the error is Caused by: freemarker.core.InvalidReferenceException: Error on line 5, column 1 in Axxell.fi-2014.7-fm-styled-theme_SERVLET_CONTEXT_/templates/menusystem.ftl_journalContentUtil.getContent(10194, "10982" ,"view","sv_SE",themeDisplay) is undefined._It cannot be assigned to footercontent [Sanitized]
08:04 < Axxell:#liferay> jhf: i didnt define it beforehand, it should be a string..
08:06 < Axxell:#liferay> jhf: how is it supposed to be done?
08:14 < modd_:#liferay> hi. is there any limitation to the drag&drop feature of the doclib? it works perfectly for jpeg but fails for xls/xlsx
08:16 < Axxell:#liferay> topolik: any ideas what im doing wrong?
08:18 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Hey guys.
08:18 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Anyone around who has experience with PDF/RTF/DOC generation in Liferay?
08:18 < Axxell:#liferay> @jhf: isnt journalContentUtil already available to use in freemarker without anything extra?
08:19 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> We need to export web content articles in different file formats...but we want to influence the way these are rendered.
08:19 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Especially: Add a header and footer to the exported documents.
08:49 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> hi all
08:49 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> still on our minify css problem :( Please take a look at https://www.liferay.com/fr/community/forums/-/message_boards/message/33252429 if you know about minify css, gzip and so on. Thanks
08:51 < satheesh:#liferay> nicolas_FR: Which web server you are using?
08:51 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> apache 2.2.9 + tomcat 6.0
08:55 < satheesh:#liferay> Okay
08:55 < satheesh:#liferay> theme.css.fast.load=true
08:55 < satheesh:#liferay> minifier.enabled=true
08:55 < satheesh:#liferay> This is the recommended way for minifying
08:56 < satheesh:#liferay> If web server is configured in proper way, it takes care of gzipping
09:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, are you guys using open office integration?
09:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, I did PDF gneration once a few years ago (from Liferay) but I built something custom using iText.
09:02 < jardineworks:#liferay> I've never done the Open Office integration but I have read that it is supposed to be easy peasy
09:03 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> satheesh : so you think I'm missing the minifier.enabled= true parameter ?
09:04 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> satheesh: fact is I have theme.css.fast.load=true (I double checked in liferay portal admin page) and it doesn't seems to be in fast load mode..
09:08 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> jardineworks: I'm not 100% sure, to be honest. Our developers experimented with the built-in export functionality and came up with the problem that global CSS isn't used for PDF rendering...and they were unable to add header and footer to it.
09:08 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Didn't have time to investigate any further yet.
09:16 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, I would share the itext code with you but I have no idea where it is now. It was not very difficult to do though. I doubt that is the best approach for you though -- for me I was generating a pdf of a report which didn't realyl change. I would guess that Open Office integration is what you need.
10:44 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> jardineworks: The main issue about this whole PDF thing is the styling, not the generation itself. I'm still not entirely sure about it.
10:44 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> The default "This article as PDF" button just renders the article with it's template into a PDF.
10:45 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, sure... but I would guess you could use media queries to create a "pdf view"
10:45 < bijoo_:#liferay> nicolas_FR: hey, try removing all except this one: base.css, from the main.css file. Rebuild and redeploy, check if it's minified.
10:45 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> If this template uses CSS classes and doesn't contain style definitions, no styling is applied.
10:45 < bijoo_:#liferay> nicolas_FR: also, I replied to your post just now. Please post the log file to the same thread/post.
10:47 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> bijoo_: ok, will try that on the test server. should be back in 15min
11:00 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> bijoo_: ack did not see you wanted the fresh logs from server restart.. trying to get you that
11:12 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> bijoo_: I replied to your answer on the forum
11:13 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> bijoo_: looking at chrome developer tools, I have 2 sources for css : base.css and main.css. Both are not minified
11:19 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> gotta go, good week end all
12:26 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik, are you around this evening?
12:30 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, maybe you can help -- I'm trying to figure out if it is possible to use the federated search (portlet #3) but specify the structureIds that are valid for the search.
12:31 < jardineworks:#liferay> There is a facet configuration that lets you specify "JournalArticle" but i need to go deeper than that and specify the individual structures so that thins like "testimonials" don't surface in the results.
