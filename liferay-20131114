03:52 < hufg:#liferay> helloo helloo

07:13 < hufg:#liferay> https://issues.liferay.com/browse/LPS-40416 what does Blocked by: LPS-41782 comment mean there
07:20 < imox1234:#liferay> hello I want to upgrade from 5.2 to the newest version what I have to do?
07:27 < hufg:#liferay> get 100k in cash and hire consultants
07:27 < hufg:#liferay> may not be enough
07:27 < hufg:#liferay> better make it 150k
07:28 < hufg:#liferay> or perhaps devote yourself to a god suitable for your liferay upgrade needs and pray for a miracle
07:31 < imox1234:#liferay> what?
07:31 < hufg:#liferay> or if you have enough calendar time start grinding through the upgrade process, first fix problems with liferay upgrade process then after you have it all down correctly start testing and fixing upcoming issues
07:32 < imox1234:#liferay> ok
07:32 < hufg:#liferay> imox1234: upgrade is REALLY hard
07:33 < imox1234:#liferay> WTF
07:33 < hufg:#liferay> :-)
07:33 < hufg:#liferay> imox1234: for example you can't even upgrade 6.1GA2 to GA3
07:33 < hufg:#liferay> it has showstoppers
07:33 < hufg:#liferay> for us at least they exist
07:34 < imox1234:#liferay> ok
07:34 < hufg:#liferay> GA3 is a "simple" bug fix release and it still is unupgradeable
07:34 < imox1234:#liferay> I have a problem with the web form plugin
07:34 < imox1234:#liferay> :(
07:34 < imox1234:#liferay> maybe can you help me to fix it ;)
07:34 < hufg:#liferay> so you want to go through some 3-4 years of upgrades when even a year is zz pzz
07:35 < hufg:#liferay> dunno dunno
07:37 < hufg:#liferay> perhaps
07:41 < imox1234:#liferay> ok moment please
08:06 < imox1234:#liferay> hufg: are you still here ;) ?
08:07 < rocknroll_:#liferay> i have an issue with the search portlet. search is ok and results display fine, but when I press "return to full page" the search portlet displays all the facets and the results. I only want to see the search field, not the previous results
08:29 < hufg:#liferay> imox1234: yes yes
08:29 < hufg:#liferay> any ideas how you can overwrite liferay's log4j FILE appender
08:29 < hufg:#liferay> with portal-ext-log4j.xml
08:29 < hufg:#liferay> uhh portal-log4j-ext.xml
08:29 < hufg:#liferay> my guss is you can't
08:30 < hufg:#liferay> guess
08:49 < imox1234:#liferay> hufg: ok problems solved
08:49 < imox1234:#liferay> thanks ;)
08:49 < imox1234:#liferay> a jar file from rhino1_7R4 was missing
08:50 < hufg:#liferay> imox1234: hehe great
08:50 < hufg:#liferay> you were going to upgrade because of that?! 8)
