01:44 < bradley:#liferay> what are the steps to use a maven svn repo to deploy to 6.1.20 bundle
03:52 < hufg:#liferay> helloo helloo
04:00 < hufg:#liferay> bradley: whats a maven svn repo?
06:21 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> ls
06:21 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Woops. Wrong terminal.
07:13 < hufg:#liferay> https://issues.liferay.com/browse/LPS-40416 what does Blocked by: LPS-41782 comment mean there
07:20 < imox1234:#liferay> hello I want to upgrade from 5.2 to the newest version what I have to do?
07:27 < hufg:#liferay> get 100k in cash and hire consultants
07:27 < hufg:#liferay> may not be enough
07:27 < hufg:#liferay> better make it 150k
07:28 < hufg:#liferay> or perhaps devote yourself to a god suitable for your liferay upgrade needs and pray for a miracle
07:31 < imox1234:#liferay> what?
07:31 < hufg:#liferay> or if you have enough calendar time start grinding through the upgrade process, first fix problems with liferay upgrade process then after you have it all down correctly start testing and fixing upcoming issues
07:32 < imox1234:#liferay> ok
07:32 < hufg:#liferay> imox1234: upgrade is REALLY hard
07:33 < imox1234:#liferay> WTF
07:33 < hufg:#liferay> :-)
07:33 < hufg:#liferay> imox1234: for example you can't even upgrade 6.1GA2 to GA3
07:33 < hufg:#liferay> it has showstoppers
07:33 < hufg:#liferay> for us at least they exist
07:34 < imox1234:#liferay> ok
07:34 < hufg:#liferay> GA3 is a "simple" bug fix release and it still is unupgradeable
07:34 < imox1234:#liferay> I have a problem with the web form plugin
07:34 < imox1234:#liferay> :(
07:34 < imox1234:#liferay> maybe can you help me to fix it ;)
07:34 < hufg:#liferay> so you want to go through some 3-4 years of upgrades when even a year is zz pzz
07:35 < hufg:#liferay> dunno dunno
07:37 < hufg:#liferay> perhaps
07:41 < imox1234:#liferay> ok moment please
08:06 < imox1234:#liferay> hufg: are you still here ;) ?
08:07 < rocknroll_:#liferay> i have an issue with the search portlet. search is ok and results display fine, but when I press "return to full page" the search portlet displays all the facets and the results. I only want to see the search field, not the previous results
08:29 < hufg:#liferay> imox1234: yes yes
08:29 < hufg:#liferay> any ideas how you can overwrite liferay's log4j FILE appender
08:29 < hufg:#liferay> with portal-ext-log4j.xml
08:29 < hufg:#liferay> uhh portal-log4j-ext.xml
08:29 < hufg:#liferay> my guss is you can't
08:30 < hufg:#liferay> guess
08:49 < imox1234:#liferay> hufg: ok problems solved
08:49 < imox1234:#liferay> thanks ;)
08:49 < imox1234:#liferay> a jar file from rhino1_7R4 was missing
08:50 < hufg:#liferay> imox1234: hehe great
08:50 < hufg:#liferay> you were going to upgrade because of that?! 8)
09:32 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey guys
09:32 < jardineworks:#liferay> does anyone know if it is possible to get a jstl variable in a scriptlet?
09:32 < jardineworks:#liferay> I know... horrible...
09:32 < jardineworks:#liferay> project almost due and we're in a sort of desperation mode :)
09:50 < jardineworks:#liferay> hhahah -- wow.. I think I need to pat myself on the back for this most REVOLTING hack I just made :)
09:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> its so gross I am going to put someone elses name on this file.
09:53 < hufg:#liferay> hmm? 8)
10:04  * Azrae|:#liferay waves, "Hi guys"
10:04 < Azrae|:#liferay> I assume rather than asking if I can ask a question I should just ask a question and see what the reaction is. So this is the prefix to the question I'm about to ask...
10:05 < Azrae|:#liferay> ... are there any workflow definitions people share somewhere for others to download? I want to try some other than the in-built 'single approver' workflow
10:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> hufg, The IA for the project didn't bother to check whether or not the little boxes they drew ACTUALLY had data points. As a result, I am using the language bundle to set the text and the image path for each of the categories. I user the name of the category replacing the spaces with hyphens and wrapping it with two string to dynamcially generate the key
10:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> so gross
10:17 < rocknroll_:#liferay> yuck
10:18 < rocknroll_:#liferay> I have resorted to similar desperate measures at times myself :)
10:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> ok -- someone please tell me I am not mental. If you have a language bundle with key=somevalue... and then in a JSP you do LanguageUtil.get( themeDisplay.getLocale(), key ) ... you should get "somevalue" back right?
10:49 < imox1234:#liferay> hufg: error again :(
10:50 < imox1234:#liferay> hufg: http://pastebin.com/HtKeJpuE
10:50 < imox1234:#liferay> have you any idea?
11:54 < jardineworks:#liferay> does anyone know if it is posible to copy request attributes automatically?
11:57 < apucay:#liferay> i think the portal uses a commons lib to do stuff like that
11:59 < jardineworks:#liferay> apucay, I have an Object ... o lets say, I would rather not use the session to persist it across renderURLs, so I am trying to do it using request attributes.
11:59 < jardineworks:#liferay> is that possible?
12:00 < jardineworks:#liferay> for example, what does copyConcurrentRenderParams do?
12:02 < jardineworks:#liferay> bah --- only works for render params
12:03 < hufg:#liferay> imox1234: noo i'm blocked from pastebin
12:04 < imox1234:#liferay> ok I found a solution
12:04 < imox1234:#liferay> I needed a new version 5.3
12:04 < imox1234:#liferay> from the web form
12:26 < imox1234:#liferay> how can I test the mail settings
12:31 < imox1234:#liferay> the web form do not sent an email :(
12:43 < imox1234:#liferay> ok now it works fine
12:43 < imox1234:#liferay> GREAT
