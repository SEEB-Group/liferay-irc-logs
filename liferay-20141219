05:15 < Axxell:#liferay> Hello Gentlewomen and men.

What i want liferay to do is to change the language to the language of the site page adress lanugage
07:05 < douglascrp:#liferay> morning all
07:05 < bwood_:#liferay> in 6.2 how do I download the web content to put in resources importer?
07:05 < bwood_:#liferay> 6.2 doesn't have the download button
07:05 < douglascrp:#liferay> I'm trying to implement a simple permission check on my custom portlet
07:06 < douglascrp:#liferay> I have some user groups, and I just need to check, is the current user member of the group "experts"?
07:06 < douglascrp:#liferay> can anyone give the tips about which api I should be learning?
07:07 < douglascrp:#liferay> and another thing is, how to check if the current user is the owner of the database object?
07:08 < douglascrp:#liferay> when a user create an object, lets say, a product's review, he's the only user that can change the review
07:09 < douglascrp:#liferay> so, basically, I have to check for groups' members and userId, but I'm not sure about which api to use
07:14 < bwood_:#liferay> do a user have a uuid?
07:18 < bwood_:#liferay> then could you just compare the uuid?
