05:15 < Axxell:#liferay> Hello Gentlewomen and men. I was wondering if there is a settings or something to change how liferay behaves when you have a translated site page url and you go to that adress? What i want liferay to do is to change the language to the language of the site page adress lanugage
07:05 < douglascrp:#liferay> morning all
07:05 < bwood_:#liferay> in 6.2 how do I download the web content to put in resources importer?
07:05 < bwood_:#liferay> 6.2 doesn't have the download button
07:05 < douglascrp:#liferay> I'm trying to implement a simple permission check on my custom portlet
07:06 < douglascrp:#liferay> I have some user groups, and I just need to check, is the current user member of the group "experts"?
07:06 < douglascrp:#liferay> can anyone give the tips about which api I should be learning?
07:07 < douglascrp:#liferay> and another thing is, how to check if the current user is the owner of the database object?
07:08 < douglascrp:#liferay> when a user create an object, lets say, a product's review, he's the only user that can change the review
07:09 < douglascrp:#liferay> so, basically, I have to check for groups' members and userId, but I'm not sure about which api to use
07:14 < bwood_:#liferay> do a user have a uuid?
07:18 < bwood_:#liferay> then could you just compare the uuid?
08:16 < plekplek:#liferay> douglascrp: hey, UserLocalServiceUtil has a hasGroupUser method that returns true if user belongs to specified group
08:18 < douglascrp:#liferay> plekplek, really? that simple?
08:18 < douglascrp:#liferay> tks
08:19 < plekplek:#liferay> douglascrp: UserLocalServiceUtil.hasGroupUser(themeDisplay.getScopeGroupId(), themeDisplay.getUserId()) should do the trick
08:43 < jardineworks:#liferay> bwood_, yeah man, huge pain the ass (the missing download button). You have to go to the database and look up the record and grab the content from the column.
08:46 < bwood_:#liferay> which table in the db?
08:47 < jardineworks:#liferay> bwood_, JournalArticle.
08:48 < jardineworks:#liferay> bwood_, granb the ID from the control panel and then look it up in that table.
08:48 < bwood_:#liferay> I think initally it was removed because you couldn't import the content using the xml file
08:48 < bwood_:#liferay> but with resources importer its really helpful to download the web content data .xml file
08:49 < bwood_:#liferay> sounds like a great hook for marketplace
08:59 < jardineworks:#liferay> bwood_, for sure
09:01 < bwood_:#liferay> you want to make it?
09:03 < jardineworks:#liferay> bwood_, lol -- I'll put it on my list :)
09:16 < douglascrp:#liferay> plekplek, I'm trying to get the groupId using GroupLocalServiceUtil.getGroup(long companyId, String name)
09:17 < douglascrp:#liferay> but I don't have a companyId
09:17 < douglascrp:#liferay> do you know another way to get the groupId using only the groupName?
09:17 < jardineworks:#liferay> douglascrp, PortalUtil.getCOmpanyId( PortletRequest | HttpServletRequest)
09:18 < douglascrp:#liferay> jardineworks, thank you dude
09:24 < jardineworks:#liferay> douglascrp, PortalUtil is your best friend in most cases :)
09:25 < douglascrp:#liferay> yeah, I have to learn to use it
09:25 < douglascrp:#liferay> jardineworks, now a architectural question
09:25 < douglascrp:#liferay> is it possible to use liferay without creating a company?
09:26 < jardineworks:#liferay> douglascrp, First thing I normally do (in eclipse) -- ctrl-shift-r ... *Util :)
09:26 < douglascrp:#liferay> I mean, create groups, users without specifying it?
