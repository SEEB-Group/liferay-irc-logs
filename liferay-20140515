02:40 < Naenyn> bijoo_: That'll be a task for tomorrow afternoon. All of the research I've done on invalidating a session points me to redirecting to /c/portal/logout, but I can't do that.. I need to log the user out but show a specific error page.
02:40 < Naenyn> basically just like the CAS no-such-user thing.
09:59 < jshinergy> Hello Everyone!
10:14 < aj_> jhf, rotty3000, how did the euro meet go? It was on the 10th right?
10:37 <@jhf> aj_: yeah I think so, but I didn’t attend
10:38 < aj_> jhf, I can't find anything about a 7.0 roadmap. Am I still too early?
10:38 <@jhf> yeah a little - next week in amsterdam will be our first “big” conference with a “Roadmap” presentation so hopefully will shed more light on what’s coming in 7
10:38 < aj_> ah -- cool. Can't wait
10:38 <@jhf> want to attend? :)
10:39 < aj_> would love to but I am starting a new gig the week following in Montreal so I need to prep for that
10:39 < aj_> otherwise I totally would have tried to!
10:39 < aj_> I've never been to Amsterdam
10:40 < aj_> and I love riding my bike!
10:41 < bijoo_> jshinergy: Hello there how is it going for you?
10:41 <@jhf> hahah yeah that’s a nice place for bikes
10:48 < jshinergy> good!
10:48 < jshinergy> would this be a good place to ask development questions?
10:49 < aj_> jshinergy, you bet
10:49 < jshinergy> i've installed social office
10:50 < jshinergy> and I would like to borrow services from the task portlet from the social office plugin
10:50 < aj_> borrow as in use them from your own custom portlet?
11:51 < bijoo_> jshinergy: so you want to call that API right?
11:54 < circ-user-IwBOk> hi all
11:55 < circ-user-IwBOk> can you please help me to understand how to call serveResource method from javascript
11:55 < aj_> circ-user-IwBOk, which version?
11:55 < circ-user-IwBOk> 6.1
11:55 < aj_> AlloyUI has a LiferayPortletURL
11:56 < aj_> object ... you can create a resource url with it
11:59 < circ-user-IwBOk> and than make a XmlHTTP request using this url ?
11:59 < aj_> easier than that
11:59 < aj_> give me a minute
11:59 < bijoo_> circ-user-IwBOk: https://gist.github.com/arvindm1/1364318
12:00 < bijoo_> http://www.liferaysolution.com/2013/05/ajax-call-using-resource-url-spring-mvc.html
12:00 < aj_> circ-user-IwBOk, http://pastebin.com/3KPMYXaM
12:03 < bijoo_> aj_: not sure if that's still there in 6.1
12:03 < aj_> bijoo_, it is, I used it in 6.1. But topolik told me it was removed in 6.2 for security
12:04 < bijoo_> aj_: oh, okay, that makes sense; interesting.
12:04 < aj_> but your solution is better from the upgrade perspective :)
12:04 < bijoo_> aj_: using Enterprise version I don't see it there; maybe it was removed in a fix pack.
12:05 < aj_> liferay-portlet.js is missing?
12:05 < bijoo_> No the Liferay.PortletURL
12:05 < aj_> I think that is what it waas called... maybe it was portlet-url.js
12:05 < aj_> oh
12:05 < bijoo_> Oh maybe that's what it is; my mistake.
12:06 < aj_> at any rate, we know it is gone in 6.2 so probably best not to get into the habit of using it :)
12:07 < bijoo_> aj_: agreed; best to use the taglib here.
12:08 < bijoo_> aj_: of course million+1 ways to do it.
12:10 < bijoo_> Liferay is to developer as this: http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-27428819
12:10 < bijoo_> The new kid on the block has a new friend :)
12:13 < aj_> I have a question. Why was that 4 year old playing in a DRIVEWAY by himself lol
12:14 < aj_> worst mom EVER.
12:15 < bijoo_> aj_: haha, don't know; I totally agree.
12:16 < bijoo_> aj_: especially if need camera there.
12:19 < bijoo_> aj_: though I think the mother was right there too.
12:19 < bijoo_> aj_: the dog came from behind the car real quick.
12:21 < bijoo_> that cat got to the dog in 1 second; took the mother couple seconds get there.
12:22 < bijoo_> That's like the Liferay cache; it is SO fast ;)
12:22 < aj_> lol
12:23 < aj_> and dynamic queries are the mom?
12:23 < bijoo_> aj_: haha, maybe; but Tara is the cache.
12:24 < bijoo_> aj_: the dog is Oracle? Maybe, haha
12:24 < aj_> LOL -- I was just gonna say that
12:24 < aj_> funny since the story was talking about putting the Dog down :)
12:25 < aj_> what they didn't mention was the 50 million dollar neighbour lawsuit for trauma,
12:27 < jshinergy> yes i would like to call the api
12:28 < bijoo_> aj_: not sure how that'll turn out for anyone.
12:28 < bijoo_> jshinergy: you can load the bean and call it that way. BeanLocatorService; I'll be back soon.
12:37 < aj_> jshinergy, I haven;t used SO .. but you should be able to use the remote service interfaces as well.
