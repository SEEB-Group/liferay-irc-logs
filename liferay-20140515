02:40 < Naenyn> bijoo_: That'll be a task for tomorrow afternoon. All of the research I've done on invalidating a session points me to redirecting to /c/portal/logout, but I can't do that.. I need to log the user out but show a specific error page.
02:40 < Naenyn> basically just like the CAS no-such-user thing.
09:59 < jshinergy> Hello Everyone!
10:14 < aj_> jhf, rotty3000, how did the euro meet go? It was on the 10th right?
10:37 <@jhf> aj_: yeah I think so, but I didn’t attend
10:38 < aj_> jhf, I can't find anything about a 7.0 roadmap. Am I still too early?
10:38 <@jhf> yeah a little - next week in amsterdam will be our first “big” conference with a “Roadmap” presentation so hopefully will shed more light on what’s coming in 7
10:38 < aj_> ah -- cool. Can't wait
