02:40 < Naenyn> bijoo_: That'll be a task for tomorrow afternoon. All of the research I've done on invalidating a session points me to redirecting to /c/portal/logout, but I can't do that.. I need to log the user out but show a specific error page.
02:40 < Naenyn> basically just like the CAS no-such-user thing.
09:59 < jshinergy> Hello Everyone!
10:14 < aj_> jhf, rotty3000, how did the euro meet go? It was on the 10th right?
10:37 <@jhf> aj_: yeah I think so, but I didn’t attend
10:38 < aj_> jhf, I can't find anything about a 7.0 roadmap. Am I still too early?
10:38 <@jhf> yeah a little - next week in amsterdam will be our first “big” conference with a “Roadmap” presentation so hopefully will shed more light on what’s coming in 7
10:38 < aj_> ah -- cool. Can't wait
10:38 <@jhf> want to attend? :)
10:39 < aj_> would love to but I am starting a new gig the week following in Montreal so I need to prep for that
10:39 < aj_> otherwise I totally would have tried to!
10:39 < aj_> I've never been to Amsterdam
10:40 < aj_> and I love riding my bike!
10:41 < bijoo_> jshinergy: Hello there how is it going for you?
10:41 <@jhf> hahah yeah that’s a nice place for bikes
10:48 < jshinergy> good!
10:48 < jshinergy> would this be a good place to ask development questions?
10:49 < aj_> jshinergy, you bet
10:49 < jshinergy> i've installed social office
10:50 < jshinergy> and I would like to borrow services from the task portlet from the social office plugin
10:50 < aj_> borrow as in use them from your own custom portlet?
11:51 < bijoo_> jshinergy: so you want to call that API right?
11:54 < circ-user-IwBOk> hi all
11:55 < circ-user-IwBOk> can you please help me to understand how to call serveResource method from javascript
11:55 < aj_> circ-user-IwBOk, which version?
11:55 < circ-user-IwBOk> 6.1
11:55 < aj_> AlloyUI has a LiferayPortletURL
11:56 < aj_> object ... you can create a resource url with it
11:59 < circ-user-IwBOk> and than make a XmlHTTP request using this url ?
11:59 < aj_> easier than that
11:59 < aj_> give me a minute

12:00 < aj_> circ-user-IwBOk, http://pastebin.com/3KPMYXaM
12:03 < bijoo_> aj_: not sure if that's still there in 6.1
12:03 < aj_> bijoo_, it is, I used it in 6.1. But topolik told me it was removed in 6.2 for security
