08:01 < scribe:#liferay> Hey guys.  Is there any way to tell which user has create a page?  Do pages have 'owners'?
08:01 < scribe:#liferay> *created.
08:02 < scribe:#liferay> We have an admin on our site who occasionally creates odd pages on our public site instead of their private area and I'd like to track down who is doing this.
08:40 < topolik1:#liferay> scribe: hi, there should be userId column with the owner
09:13 < bijoo_:#liferay> scribe: Look in the database for the Layout; the column names are as follows here: userName, userId, createDate, modifiedDate
09:13 < bijoo_:#liferay> scribe: of course, you can get this through API
09:13 < bijoo_:#liferay> scribe: it's not to say you can't do it thrugh code; which is really easy using console
09:15 < scribe:#liferay> bijoo, topolik1, how do I know what row to look for in the database?  If I use my browser and halt the page in the javascript debugger, is there a call I can make to get the 'pageid' or something?
09:16 < bijoo_:#liferay> plekplek: hey, you can add a listener for that.
09:16 < bijoo_:#liferay> plekplek: I don't know of any feature right now; but it should be easy enough plugin.
09:18 < topolik1:#liferay> scribe: to get current plid (layout primary key) using javascript: window.Liferay.ThemeDisplay.getPlid()
09:20 < scribe:#liferay> ok, great!  It's 585852 :)
09:25 < scribe:#liferay> bijoo, topolik1, the Layout table doesn't have a userId or userName column
09:27 < bijoo_:#liferay> scribe: which version of Liferay are you using?
09:27 < bijoo_:#liferay> scribe: https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/blob/master/sql/portal-tables.sql#L970
09:27 < scribe:#liferay> 6.1GA2
09:28 < bijoo_:#liferay> scribe: okay, so you're right that version lacked it.
09:28 < scribe:#liferay> bummer.
09:28 < scribe:#liferay> thanks for your help anyway
09:29 < jardineworks:#liferay> scribe, write a hook that records it in a secret table to catch them next time :)
09:29 < jardineworks:#liferay> an onCreate for the Layout model
