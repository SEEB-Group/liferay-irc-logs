08:01 < scribe:#liferay> Hey guys.  Is there any way to tell which user has create a page?  Do pages have 'owners'?
08:01 < scribe:#liferay> *created.
08:02 < scribe:#liferay> We have an admin on our site who occasionally creates odd pages on our public site instead of their private area and I'd like to track down who is doing this.
08:40 < topolik1:#liferay> scribe: hi, there should be userId column with the owner
09:13 < bijoo_:#liferay> scribe: Look in the database for the Layout; the column names are as follows here: userName, userId, createDate, modifiedDate
09:13 < bijoo_:#liferay> scribe: of course, you can get this through API
09:13 < bijoo_:#liferay> scribe: it's not to say you can't do it thrugh code; which is really easy using console
09:15 < scribe:#liferay> bijoo, topolik1, how do I know what row to look for in the database?  If I use my browser and halt the page in the javascript debugger, is there a call I can make to get the 'pageid' or something?
09:16 < bijoo_:#liferay> plekplek: hey, you can add a listener for that.
09:16 < bijoo_:#liferay> plekplek: I don't know of any feature right now; but it should be easy enough plugin.
09:18 < topolik1:#liferay> scribe: to get current plid (layout primary key) using javascript: window.Liferay.ThemeDisplay.getPlid()
09:20 < scribe:#liferay> ok, great!  It's 585852 :)
09:25 < scribe:#liferay> bijoo, topolik1, the Layout table doesn't have a userId or userName column
09:27 < bijoo_:#liferay> scribe: which version of Liferay are you using?
09:27 < bijoo_:#liferay> scribe: https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/blob/master/sql/portal-tables.sql#L970
09:27 < scribe:#liferay> 6.1GA2
09:28 < bijoo_:#liferay> scribe: okay, so you're right that version lacked it.
09:28 < scribe:#liferay> bummer.
09:28 < scribe:#liferay> thanks for your help anyway
09:29 < jardineworks:#liferay> scribe, write a hook that records it in a secret table to catch them next time :)
09:29 < jardineworks:#liferay> an onCreate for the Layout model
09:30 < jardineworks:#liferay> .. you can probably use the auditing portion of the API with that hook so that the event is recorded in the Audit table even.
09:31 < scribe:#liferay> jardineworks, that would be cool.
09:32 < bijoo_:#liferay> scribe: also can check portletpreferences
09:32 < scribe:#liferay> But, we are hoping to migrate to 6.2 soon and then I can use the userName column.
09:32 < scribe:#liferay> had some trouble migrating data from 6.1 to 6.2.
09:32 < bijoo_:#liferay> see if anything with the plid's in there; if ownertype is individual; then the ownerId gives it away
09:32 < scribe:#liferay> Been a while now.  Need to test again.
09:33 < scribe:#liferay> bijoo_, ok.  I'll check.
09:34 < bijoo_:#liferay> https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/blob/6.1.0-ga1/portal-impl/src/com/liferay/portal/service/impl/LayoutLocalServiceImpl.java#L294
09:35 < bijoo_:#liferay> scribe: also the Resource table records it
09:35 < scribe:#liferay> ownerIds are all 0 (ownerTypes are all 3)
09:35 < bijoo_:#liferay> scribe: yes then no individual-scoped prefs
09:36 < bijoo_:#liferay> scribe: lastly by default layout commenst true; so should find an entry here as well:
09:36 < bijoo_:#liferay> https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/blob/6.1.0-ga1/portal-impl/src/com/liferay/portal/service/impl/LayoutLocalServiceImpl.java#L320
09:36 < bijoo_:#liferay> MBMessage
09:37 < bijoo_:#liferay> in MBMessage the column name is : classPK
09:39 < scribe:#liferay> bijoo, I'm not sure I understand that last one.
09:39 < bijoo_:#liferay> scribe: the table name to check is as follows: MBMessage
09:40 < bijoo_:#liferay> in that table is a column for plid (though it's named classPK with classNameId corresponding to com.liferay.portal.model.Layout className in the ClassName_ Table)
09:41 < bijoo_:#liferay> scribe: here is the query to run for it:
09:41 < bijoo_:#liferay> select userId from MBMessage where classNameId = (select classNameId from ClassName_ where value = "com.liferay.portal.model.Layout") and classPK = 10178;
09:41 < bijoo_:#liferay> replace 10178 with plid
09:42 < rrapozo:#liferay> I'm here again!!! :D
09:43 < rrapozo:#liferay> Someone understand about translation in Liferay?
09:43 < bijoo_:#liferay> rrapozo: Hello; what's your question about that in LR?
09:44 < rrapozo:#liferay> I have the liferay 6.1 and the translation in Portuguese from Portugal is %#$&$#%. So I need override somethings like the link to enter in login page. But how.
09:45 < rrapozo:#liferay> bijoo_: Thanks for helping!
09:45 < jardineworks:#liferay> rrapozo, you need a language hooks
09:45 < jardineworks:#liferay> hook*
09:45 < jardineworks:#liferay> and then just specify the key used by liferay, and your version.
09:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> you can probably just make a copy of the portuguese language file in your hook and then change the values as needed.
09:46 < bijoo_:#liferay> rrapozo: you can do that several ways here; the fastest is to create hook plugin; per jardineworks; I suggest also submit to Liferay; so in future versions they add your fix
09:47 < jardineworks:#liferay> is there a way to specify portuguese for brazil? I mean, I know you can use a different locale, but is it "recognized" as a standard?
09:48 < jardineworks:#liferay> because if it is, like bijoo says, you should submit it to LR. I wouldn't submit the brazilian version to replace the portugal version though. I speak Spanish (from Spain) and the south american version is different, but neither is "more correct" than the other
09:50 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: yes, rrapozo: what jardineworks said; there is Language_pt_BR and Laguage_pt_PT for this exact reason I'm assuming since the two are really quite different.
09:52 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo, right .. like fr_FR and fr_CA, though I am not sure the fr_CA is officially recognized as a locale.
09:53 < rrapozo:#liferay> jardineworks: yes, pt_BR and pt_PT are like en_US an en_AU for example.
09:53 < rrapozo:#liferay> yes
09:54 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo_, were you at the symposium on October?
09:54 < rrapozo:#liferay> So if I get it is: I can change the translation with hook, but are best practices report to liferay the mistakes of language?
