03:33 < Bhushan:#liferay> hi
03:36 < Bhushan:#liferay> does liferay portal have anything to stream and upload videos for users of portal?
03:56 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Bhushan: I couldn't find anything. At least not out-of-the-box.
03:57 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> You can upload videos to the documents library, but that's about it. From there you can only offer them as download.
03:57 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Anything else you either need to build yourself or look for a plugin.
03:57 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> (I'm not sure if 6.2. has something. Haven't had the time to look into it yet.)
03:59 < Bhushan:#liferay> do liferay have any plugin that will help users watch video streamings online, more like youtube?
04:04 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> How about you look for yourself? ;)
04:17 < Bhushan:#liferay> cool. Thanks for help :)

05:02 < bjornjohansson:#liferay> anyone here that has experience using ImageMagick with preview generation for xls-files?
05:03 < bjornjohansson:#liferay> I downloaded ImageMagick (for windows 64bit)
05:03 < bjornjohansson:#liferay> installed it
05:03 < bjornjohansson:#liferay> put the path inside portal-ext.properties and enabled ImageMagick
05:03 < bjornjohansson:#liferay> But nothing happens
05:04 < bjornjohansson:#liferay> and I can't see any errors either
05:04 < bjornjohansson:#liferay> in catalina.out
05:05 < bjornjohansson:#liferay> imagemagick.enabled=true
05:05 < bjornjohansson:#liferay> imagemagick.global.search.path[windows]=C:\\Program Files\\ImageMagick
05:07 < bjornjohansson:#liferay> So i'm pretty stucked, don't know how to progress
05:11 < bjornjohansson:#liferay> Do I need Xuggler for xls-files?
05:14 < bjornjohansson:#liferay> oh and by the way, my enviorment: Liferay Portal Community Edition 6.1.1 CE GA2 (Paton / Build 6101 / July 31, 2012)
06:06 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> is there any way to run a custom piece of code while a portlet is being deployed? like generating an entry in a database or shared map? or should i use web.xml/servlet for that?
06:21 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Wow. I'm confused.
06:21 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Our Liferay cloud instances are awfully slow.
06:21 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> But neither the memory, nor the CPUs are under heavy load.
06:21 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> The database server also reports almost no load.
06:22 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Where else could the slow responses come from? Oo
06:26 < hufg_:#liferay> you could inspect which part is slow
06:27 < hufg_:#liferay> ie. is the time to first byte slow or for example resource transfers or perhaps dl/image gallery
06:27 < hufg_:#liferay> it can be anyywhere
06:27 < hufg_:#liferay> maybe the cloud imploded
06:33 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> It could only be network traffic now, I think.
06:34 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Everything else should lead to peaks somewhere, I think.
06:35 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> It's so weird...several pages are loading and loading...and the box doesn't show any strain.
