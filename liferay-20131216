03:33 < Bhushan:#liferay> hi
03:36 < Bhushan:#liferay> does liferay portal have anything to stream and upload videos for users of portal?
03:56 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Bhushan: I couldn't find anything. At least not out-of-the-box.
03:57 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> You can upload videos to the documents library, but that's about it. From there you can only offer them as download.
03:57 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Anything else you either need to build yourself or look for a plugin.
03:57 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> (I'm not sure if 6.2. has something. Haven't had the time to look into it yet.)
03:59 < Bhushan:#liferay> do liferay have any plugin that will help users watch video streamings online, more like youtube?
04:04 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> How about you look for yourself? ;)
04:17 < Bhushan:#liferay> cool. Thanks for help :)

05:02 < bjornjohansson:#liferay> anyone here that has experience using ImageMagick with preview generation for xls-files?
05:03 < bjornjohansson:#liferay> I downloaded ImageMagick (for windows 64bit)
05:03 < bjornjohansson:#liferay> installed it
05:03 < bjornjohansson:#liferay> put the path inside portal-ext.properties and enabled ImageMagick
05:03 < bjornjohansson:#liferay> But nothing happens
05:04 < bjornjohansson:#liferay> and I can't see any errors either
05:04 < bjornjohansson:#liferay> in catalina.out
05:05 < bjornjohansson:#liferay> imagemagick.enabled=true
05:05 < bjornjohansson:#liferay> imagemagick.global.search.path[windows]=C:\\Program Files\\ImageMagick
05:07 < bjornjohansson:#liferay> So i'm pretty stucked, don't know how to progress
05:11 < bjornjohansson:#liferay> Do I need Xuggler for xls-files?
05:14 < bjornjohansson:#liferay> oh and by the way, my enviorment: Liferay Portal Community Edition 6.1.1 CE GA2 (Paton / Build 6101 / July 31, 2012)
06:06 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> is there any way to run a custom piece of code while a portlet is being deployed? like generating an entry in a database or shared map? or should i use web.xml/servlet for that?
06:21 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Wow. I'm confused.
06:21 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Our Liferay cloud instances are awfully slow.
06:21 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> But neither the memory, nor the CPUs are under heavy load.
06:21 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> The database server also reports almost no load.
06:22 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Where else could the slow responses come from? Oo
06:26 < hufg_:#liferay> you could inspect which part is slow
06:27 < hufg_:#liferay> ie. is the time to first byte slow or for example resource transfers or perhaps dl/image gallery
06:27 < hufg_:#liferay> it can be anyywhere
06:27 < hufg_:#liferay> maybe the cloud imploded
06:33 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> It could only be network traffic now, I think.
06:34 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Everything else should lead to peaks somewhere, I think.
06:35 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> It's so weird...several pages are loading and loading...and the box doesn't show any strain.

12:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey jhf  are you around?
12:29 <@jhf:#liferay> jardineworks: yup
12:30 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, do you know how to get the categories assigned to a piece of content in a vm template?
12:30 <@jhf:#liferay> yup. sure do!
12:30 < jardineworks:#liferay> there is a reserved variable with the tags...
12:30 <@jhf:#liferay> lemme find it. someone else asked this.
12:30 < jardineworks:#liferay> but I need both
12:30 < jardineworks:#liferay> or bof of thems as my sone would say
12:31 < jardineworks:#liferay> son
12:31 < jardineworks:#liferay> ugh
12:34 <@jhf:#liferay> ok well I can't find it, so I shall make it from scratch. take about 20 mins.
12:35 <@jhf:#liferay> cause I don't remember the APIs either :)
12:44 < jardineworks:#liferay> ah -- but there is no reserved variable or anything for it?
12:44 <@jhf:#liferay> nope. but I have a solution for you. you have to call the category service.
12:45 <@jhf:#liferay> just fine tuning it.
12:45 < jardineworks:#liferay> awesome thanks jhf
13:00 <@jhf:#liferay> jardineworks: http://pastebin.com/F7ap2ASy
13:01 <@jhf:#liferay> this requires the use of serviceLocator which is disabled by default
13:01 <@jhf:#liferay> to enable it (for 6.1) put this in your portal-ext.properties:
13:01 <@jhf:#liferay>     journal.template.velocity.restricted.variables=
13:01 <@jhf:#liferay> (with nothing after the =)
13:06 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf,  awesome.. I am using service locator (based on your direction from waaaaaaaaaaaaaay back) so i should be all set there. Thanks for saving me the research though :)
13:06 <@jhf:#liferay> no problem, it's fun to see what I can get away with in scripting :)
13:08 < jardineworks:#liferay> hahah fun... that wasn't the term I was using.
13:08 <@jhf:#liferay> :)
