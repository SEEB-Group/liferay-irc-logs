04:23 < hufg:#liferay> are you aware how great glassfish command line tooling is?!
04:23 < hufg:#liferay> it's fucking awesome
09:22 < hufg:#liferay> topolik:
09:23 < hufg:#liferay> how come multiple publishings does not apparently decrease the disk writes from dl?
09:35 < hufg:#liferay> there is a huge write of small files to tmp either way
09:36 < hufg:#liferay> i think some 800mb with our dl
09:36 < hufg:#liferay> not sure
09:42 < hufg:#liferay> so yeah basically the publish range does not work at all for dl maybe it works at later staging but the same writes happen
