04:23 < hufg:#liferay> are you aware how great glassfish command line tooling is?!
04:23 < hufg:#liferay> it's fucking awesome
09:22 < hufg:#liferay> topolik:
09:23 < hufg:#liferay> how come multiple publishings does not apparently decrease the disk writes from dl?
09:35 < hufg:#liferay> there is a huge write of small files to tmp either way
09:36 < hufg:#liferay> i think some 800mb with our dl
09:36 < hufg:#liferay> not sure

10:18 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> We can't be the only ones who want to do this. Oo
10:19 < hufg:#liferay> :D
10:19 < hufg:#liferay> better believe it

10:20 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I honestly don't know the details of how EHCache works.
10:21 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> There is stuff like JDBC_PING and S3_PING for node-detection.
10:21 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> But I have no clue if that would be sufficient.
10:21 < hufg:#liferay> or  some crazy stuff on ehcache+san drives for lucene and dl
