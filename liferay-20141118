04:46 < modd_:#liferay> hey topolik. I think this profile is a fake: https://www.liferay.com/web/haji282/profile - can you remove it somehow?
08:00 < modd_:#liferay> jardineworks: forget about the struts portlet, it's even simpler: whitelist the portlet and build any url with state maximized and the portletid. you only have to make sure, that it has guest permissions as default
08:00 < modd_:#liferay> :)
08:36 < chris_cook:#liferay> hi everyone- does anyone have any experience using liferay as an identity provider for authentication in other services? i'm struggling to find concrete information on it
09:03 < jardineworks:#liferay> modd_, neat -- but I wasn't suggesting a struts portlet, I was asking about a StrutsAction :)
09:03 < jardineworks:#liferay> modd_, but what you did is still simpler.
09:03 < jardineworks:#liferay> modd_, so you have a regular mvc portlet, and then the whitelist configuration in the portal-ext? that's it?
09:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> chris_cook, that is a new feature in 6.2 I think -- probably why you can't find a lot of examples.
09:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> chris_cook, your best best is probably to dig through the source.
09:07 < chris_cook:#liferay> thought as much- is it in CE or only EE?
09:07 < jardineworks:#liferay> chris_cook, that I am not sure of to be honest. Most of the features in EE are also in CE though
09:08 < jardineworks:#liferay> chris_cook, I have the EE source handy, gimme a sec I'll have a quick once over.
09:08 < chris_cook:#liferay> thankyou
09:08 < jardineworks:#liferay> chris_cook, if topolik is around, he is the man you want to talk to
09:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> chris_cook, Liferay as an IdP for SAML tokens? is that right?
09:13 < modd_:#liferay> jardineworks: yep, that's it. of course I used a hook to change the whitelisted portlets
09:14 < modd_:#liferay> but I think this can cause issies as all hooks are overriding all whitelist portlets instead of adding them. the notification portlet does the same^^
09:14 < chris_cook:#liferay> jardineworks: i think so
09:17 < jardineworks:#liferay> modd_, true, and it's also a problem in a multi-instance environment because hooks are global. I have some helper code that I use to allow the configuration of a hook by company web id -- but it means that all the hooks need to have short circuit logic to return (or simply invoke the parent and return) when not configured.
09:20 < modd_:#liferay> well...one moment
09:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> chris_cook, looks like an EE thing only. I downloaded the plugin and at first glance (the portal.properties) there are a series of plugins that basically expose portla urls that the custoom code listens to for requests.
09:22 < modd_:#liferay> jardineworks: Application Adapter won't work for property hookings...bad :(
09:23 < chris_cook:#liferay> jardineworks: right, we're hoping to upgrade to EE soon, so i'll look into it further then. thanks again for your help
09:25 < jardineworks:#liferay> chris_cook, good news is, when you do upgrade? looks to me like a simple exercise of install the plugin and do a couple of configurations.
09:25 < chris_cook:#liferay> jardineworks: great, hopefully it'll be straight forward then. thank you
09:30 < dave_k:#liferay> Are there any patches for the LR6.2 UpgradeProcess? This is the second time I'm having NullPointerExceptions due to null entries in the DB (in the columns DLFILEENTRY.extension and JOURNALARTICLE.urltitle).

11:45 < urug_:#liferay> Hi, I've got a problem with FaceletedSearcher and SearchContext. If I set up multiple entry class names to SearchContext (context.setEntryClassNames(JournalArticle.class.getName(),DLFileEntry.class.getName())) then results of the search are not limited to these classes, but all indexed classes are searched. If I set single entry class name it works fine and the results are limited only to this
11:45 < urug_:#liferay> class.
11:52 < urug_:#liferay> This works - searchContext.setAttribute("entryClassName", JournalArticle.class.getName());
11:53 < urug_:#liferay> This does NOT work - searchContext.setAttribute("entryClassName", new String[] {JournalArticle.class.getName(), DLFileEntry.class.getName()});
11:56 < urug_:#liferay> I also tried using MultiValueFacet ... facet.setFieldName("entryClassName"); facet.setValues(new String[] {JournalArticle.class.getName()}); ... does NOT work at all (looks like that "entryClassName" attribute can't be an array)
12:06 < urug_:#liferay> oh, "entryClassName" atrribute on searchContext works only if a facet with that attribute is added to searchContext ... still only single class name works
12:40 < kermitt:#liferay> Morning all: Question : My company deploys a 3 node cluster with Liferay but it always seems that  one cluster will pick up most of the activity...
12:40 < kermitt:#liferay> WHich node picks up the most changes - so not a physical machine issue.
12:40 < kermitt:#liferay> Thoughts? Links?
12:41 < kermitt:#liferay>  ( i.e., Which node will act as the Master/ )
13:54 < winem_:#liferay> do you have any kind of webserver / proxy in front of your cluster?
13:58 < jardineworks:#liferay> urug_, can you share a pastebin or something with your code?
14:06 < winem_:#liferay> hey jardine :)
14:09 < winem_:#liferay> admired scholar of liferay ;)
14:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey winem_ how's it going?
14:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> haha -- hardly
14:11 < winem_:#liferay> almost fine now. most of the documentation and bureaucratic stuff after the storage outtage is done and I look forward for a workshop regarding the ops-view of liferay with the leading liferay partners in germany.
14:11 < kermitt:#liferay> Yes, we do have a proxy in front of the cluster
14:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> winem_, yeah, your email certainly sounded like a rough ride.
14:11 < winem_:#liferay> who is responsible for the loadbalancing? the proxy or liferay itself?
14:12 < kermitt:#liferay> ( I believe that it is set to send to the next node is a 'round robin' fashon
14:12 < kermitt:#liferay> the proxy ought to be in charge of load balancing
14:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> winem_, kermitt normally, I think, the master node if the first one started ... because the other nodes will have their views "attached" ...
14:13 < kermitt:#liferay> gotcha
14:13 < winem_:#liferay> the classic one
14:15 < jardineworks:#liferay> kermitt, though what shows up in the log might depend on the type of clustering you are using. Currently, I am using the JGroups .. unicast/TCP
14:15 < jardineworks:#liferay> kermitt, I think one of the ways you might be able to tell is through scheduled jobs. I'm pretty sure that they only fire on the master node.
14:15 < kermitt:#liferay> oh!
14:16 < kermitt:#liferay> That is an interesting thought
14:16 < kermitt:#liferay> I will examine w/ that in mind
14:17 < jardineworks:#liferay> kermitt,  I would set this --
14:17 < jardineworks:#liferay>    # Set the interval in minutes on how often CheckArticleMessageListener will
14:17 < jardineworks:#liferay>     # run to check for and send email on web content due for review.
14:17 < jardineworks:#liferay>     #
14:17 < jardineworks:#liferay>     journal.article.check.interval=15
14:17 < jardineworks:#liferay> to something lower
14:17 < jardineworks:#liferay> like 2 minutes or something
14:18 < jardineworks:#liferay> then with a debugger you'll be able to see which server the breakpoint fires on.
14:20  * kermitt:#liferay google 'CheckArticleMessageListener'   :)
14:27 < winem_:#liferay> and I'll go home now.
14:27 < kermitt:#liferay> :)
14:27 < kermitt:#liferay> Very thanks
14:28 < jardineworks:#liferay> g'night winem_ !
15:41 < urug_:#liferay> I am back...
15:41 < urug_:#liferay> jardineworks, give a minute i will send you that code
16:02 < urug_:#liferay> So this is the part with where the search logic is made: http://pastebin.com/dsvpHdJt
16:03 < urug_:#liferay> And this is the whole JSP: http://pastebin.com/L4BN3PD8
16:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> urug_, you're using OOTB Lucene right?
16:11 < urug_:#liferay> I quess so, I havne't change anything, so if it's the default...
16:11 < urug_:#liferay> btw liferay 6.2
16:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> k
16:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> just comparing what you have to the main_search.jsp from the search portlet.
16:13 < jardineworks:#liferay> urug_, Have you tried  adding a breakpoint to the FactedSearcher class in the createFullQuery method?
16:13 < jardineworks:#liferay> which entities are you trying to limit the query to?
16:13 < jardineworks:#liferay> oh i see
16:14 < jardineworks:#liferay> JournalArticle and DLFileEntry
16:14 < jardineworks:#liferay> is there a reason you don't want to use the Search portlet with a custom Advanced configuration?
16:20 < urug_:#liferay> I've got a theory why it doesn't work ... the FacetedSearcher goes throught entryClassNames and tries to find indexer for each class name using IndexerRegistryUtil - in my case it finds JournalArticleIndexer and DLEntryIndexer (or something like that), than it lets these indexer to process the query, but each of these indexers will add a condition that field "entryClassName" should equals to
16:20 < urug_:#liferay> it's appropriate class name (JournalArticle and DLFileEntry), but it's done one at the time without using "OR" between these two conditions... could it be possible?
16:24 < urug_:#liferay> But if this would be the case, the results would be probably limited to the last entryClassName, but they are not limited to any class.
16:24 < jardineworks:#liferay> urug_, but if they are done one at a time, wouldn't that be the same thing as an OR?
16:25 < jardineworks:#liferay> urug_, what happens if you use the second approach, in a loop though, adding each facet individually?
16:25 < jardineworks:#liferay> rather than as an array...
16:27 < jardineworks:#liferay> ... can you put a breakpoint at the return fullQuery; line in the FacetedSearcher class so we can see what the full query (as a string) looks like?
16:28 < urug_:#liferay> I will try, but my quess is that the facet basically changes the attributes of searchContext, so the value of the attribute would be the same as the value of the last added facet and this value would be used
16:29 < jardineworks:#liferay> urug_, maybe, but there is a separate loop in that method to add facet filters to the query -- so I think it would skip over the entryClassNames loop, bypassing the indexer registry stuff.
16:31 < urug_:#liferay> I am working from SDK so I can't edit the FacetedSearcher directly or can I? I could create MyFacetedSearcher however
16:32 < jardineworks:#liferay> I think you would need a web-plugin to swap them out.
16:32 < jardineworks:#liferay> but -- if you are creating your own search portlet then you could just extend it I think -- I believe it is part of the portal-service.jar.
16:37 < urug_:#liferay> That second approach with two facets works as I said, the latest one it taken into account. But I think I sould NOT use MultiValuedFacet, but a single valued one, and I should call facet.setValue(className), instead of searchContext.setAttribute("entryClassName", DLFileEntry.class.getName())
16:37 < urug_:#liferay> so I will try that as well...
16:41 < urug_:#liferay> Ah, but there isn't any facet which takes single value....
16:43 < jardineworks:#liferay> urug_, what happens if you add them, as you have been to the search context, and then do this --
