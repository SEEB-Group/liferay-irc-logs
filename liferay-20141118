04:46 < modd_:#liferay> hey topolik. I think this profile is a fake: https://www.liferay.com/web/haji282/profile - can you remove it somehow?
08:00 < modd_:#liferay> jardineworks: forget about the struts portlet, it's even simpler: whitelist the portlet and build any url with state maximized and the portletid. you only have to make sure, that it has guest permissions as default
08:00 < modd_:#liferay> :)
08:36 < chris_cook:#liferay> hi everyone- does anyone have any experience using liferay as an identity provider for authentication in other services? i'm struggling to find concrete information on it
09:03 < jardineworks:#liferay> modd_, neat -- but I wasn't suggesting a struts portlet, I was asking about a StrutsAction :)
09:03 < jardineworks:#liferay> modd_, but what you did is still simpler.
09:03 < jardineworks:#liferay> modd_, so you have a regular mvc portlet, and then the whitelist configuration in the portal-ext? that's it?
09:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> chris_cook, that is a new feature in 6.2 I think -- probably why you can't find a lot of examples.
09:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> chris_cook, your best best is probably to dig through the source.
