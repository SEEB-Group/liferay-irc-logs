04:46 < modd_:#liferay> hey topolik. I think this profile is a fake: https://www.liferay.com/web/haji282/profile - can you remove it somehow?
08:00 < modd_:#liferay> jardineworks: forget about the struts portlet, it's even simpler: whitelist the portlet and build any url with state maximized and the portletid. you only have to make sure, that it has guest permissions as default
08:00 < modd_:#liferay> :)
08:36 < chris_cook:#liferay> hi everyone- does anyone have any experience using liferay as an identity provider for authentication in other services? i'm struggling to find concrete information on it
09:03 < jardineworks:#liferay> modd_, neat -- but I wasn't suggesting a struts portlet, I was asking about a StrutsAction :)
09:03 < jardineworks:#liferay> modd_, but what you did is still simpler.
09:03 < jardineworks:#liferay> modd_, so you have a regular mvc portlet, and then the whitelist configuration in the portal-ext? that's it?
09:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> chris_cook, that is a new feature in 6.2 I think -- probably why you can't find a lot of examples.
09:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> chris_cook, your best best is probably to dig through the source.
09:07 < chris_cook:#liferay> thought as much- is it in CE or only EE?
09:07 < jardineworks:#liferay> chris_cook, that I am not sure of to be honest. Most of the features in EE are also in CE though
09:08 < jardineworks:#liferay> chris_cook, I have the EE source handy, gimme a sec I'll have a quick once over.
09:08 < chris_cook:#liferay> thankyou
09:08 < jardineworks:#liferay> chris_cook, if topolik is around, he is the man you want to talk to
09:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> chris_cook, Liferay as an IdP for SAML tokens? is that right?
09:13 < modd_:#liferay> jardineworks: yep, that's it. of course I used a hook to change the whitelisted portlets
09:14 < modd_:#liferay> but I think this can cause issies as all hooks are overriding all whitelist portlets instead of adding them. the notification portlet does the same^^
09:14 < chris_cook:#liferay> jardineworks: i think so
09:17 < jardineworks:#liferay> modd_, true, and it's also a problem in a multi-instance environment because hooks are global. I have some helper code that I use to allow the configuration of a hook by company web id -- but it means that all the hooks need to have short circuit logic to return (or simply invoke the parent and return) when not configured.
09:20 < modd_:#liferay> well...one moment
09:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> chris_cook, looks like an EE thing only. I downloaded the plugin and at first glance (the portal.properties) there are a series of plugins that basically expose portla urls that the custoom code listens to for requests.
09:22 < modd_:#liferay> jardineworks: Application Adapter won't work for property hookings...bad :(
09:23 < chris_cook:#liferay> jardineworks: right, we're hoping to upgrade to EE soon, so i'll look into it further then. thanks again for your help
09:25 < jardineworks:#liferay> chris_cook, good news is, when you do upgrade? looks to me like a simple exercise of install the plugin and do a couple of configurations.
09:25 < chris_cook:#liferay> jardineworks: great, hopefully it'll be straight forward then. thank you
09:30 < dave_k:#liferay> Are there any patches for the LR6.2 UpgradeProcess? This is the second time I'm having NullPointerExceptions due to null entries in the DB (in the columns DLFILEENTRY.extension and JOURNALARTICLE.urltitle).
