04:24 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> hi there
04:28 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> We're migrating from 5.2.3 to 6.1.2 and we have a problem with our portlets. Fact is all our pages are ok, but we're just beginning to migrate the portlets from 5.2.3 to 6.1.2. So atm pages shows "portlet foo is missing or not deployed". We migrated portlet foo, but the pages were still missing the portlet, when we were able to deploy it from the menu "add a portlet". Anything to look forward to get pages to recognize the fresh
09:02 < Urug_:#liferay> I can create Application Display Theme with the type "Documents and Media Template", the question is where can I use this template? Document and Media Portlet does not have an option to set Display Theme (at least in it's configuration, maybe it's possible programatically?).
09:10 < Urug_:#liferay> Oh I see, Media Gallery Portlet has this option. Naming is a little bit confusing I would say.
09:17 < jardineworks_:#liferay> Urug_, naming and nomeclature is not really a strong suit for LR. Layout vs. Page (though both are used) ... Company vs. Portal Instance (though both are used)... Scope Group, Group, Site ... used interchangeably :)
09:17 < jardineworks_:#liferay> you get used to it
09:24 < Urug_:#liferay> yea I had a little hard time with those too
09:30 < Urug_:#liferay> Some glossary page with all these terms compared and explained would help a lot to begginers.

09:43 < jardineworks_:#liferay> nicolas_FR, interesting. Do the portlets have the same names between versions? Are the WAR files that are generated the same?
09:44 < jardineworks_:#liferay> are any of the portlets instanceable?
09:45 < Urug_:#liferay> When I remove all $processor.processColumn(...) directives from Layout Template I get java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: -1. I need a layout where user can't place any portlets (they are all embedded). Any help?
