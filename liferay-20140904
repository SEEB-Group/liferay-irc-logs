04:24 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> hi there
04:28 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> We're migrating from 5.2.3 to 6.1.2 and we have a problem with our portlets. Fact is all our pages are ok, but we're just beginning to migrate the portlets from 5.2.3 to 6.1.2. So atm pages shows "portlet foo is missing or not deployed". We migrated portlet foo, but the pages were still missing the portlet, when we were able to deploy it from the menu "add a portlet". Anything to look forward to get pages to recognize the fresh
09:02 < Urug_:#liferay> I can create Application Display Theme with the type "Documents and Media Template", the question is where can I use this template? Document and Media Portlet does not have an option to set Display Theme (at least in it's configuration, maybe it's possible programatically?).
09:10 < Urug_:#liferay> Oh I see, Media Gallery Portlet has this option. Naming is a little bit confusing I would say.
09:17 < jardineworks_:#liferay> Urug_, naming and nomeclature is not really a strong suit for LR. Layout vs. Page (though both are used) ... Company vs. Portal Instance (though both are used)... Scope Group, Group, Site ... used interchangeably :)
09:17 < jardineworks_:#liferay> you get used to it
09:24 < Urug_:#liferay> yea I had a little hard time with those too
09:30 < Urug_:#liferay> Some glossary page with all these terms compared and explained would help a lot to begginers.
09:34 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> hi there
09:34 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> We're migrating from 5.2.3 to 6.1.2 and we have a problem with our portlets.

09:43 < jardineworks_:#liferay> nicolas_FR, interesting. Do the portlets have the same names between versions? Are the WAR files that are generated the same?
09:44 < jardineworks_:#liferay> are any of the portlets instanceable?
09:45 < Urug_:#liferay> When I remove all $processor.processColumn(...) directives from Layout Template I get java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: -1. I need a layout where user can't place any portlets (they are all embedded). Any help?
09:46 < jardineworks_:#liferay> Urug_, leave it in there and set the permissions such that no one is allowed to add portlets
09:46 < jardineworks_:#liferay> :)
10:07 < Urug_:#liferay> Well it would requiere to apply these permissons on each page having this layout and I am not sure if the droplet zone, which creates unnecessary space in the page, would go away.
10:07 < Urug_:#liferay> *dropzone :)
10:09 < jardineworks_:#liferay> Urug_, I don't have a theme handy in front of me, but couldn't you override the css that allows the drop zone? add your own style that removes it and then use that css in that particular layout only?
10:20 < Urug_:#liferay> That's possible, but I am not sure if i like it :)
10:24 < jardineworks_:#liferay> Urug_, pfft... well, next time make sure to mention your are trying to build a pyramid :P
10:26 < Urug_:#liferay> Every time I do something on Liferay I have a feeling that I have to bypass something or do some work arounds.
10:27 < jardineworks_:#liferay> Urug_, that's a glass half empty. Liferay is almost entirely configurable through plugins right? that's not by passing. Case and point, you undeploy your theme and your custom layout template and it goes right back to the way it works OOTB
10:27 < jardineworks_:#liferay> the fact that you can make those kind of changes is part of what makes liferay so powerful if you ask me
10:28 < jardineworks_:#liferay> unlike most other vendors who TELL YOU its customizeable, and then provide you a "special build"
10:31 < Urug_:#liferay> I am not saying it's liferay fault, I am rather worried if I am not doing something wrong just because I don't understand it.
10:32 < jardineworks_:#liferay> Urug_, fair point. The problem with so much flexibility is that there are so many ways to get it done -- so you might spend some time second guessing yourself :)
10:32 < jardineworks_:#liferay> Urug_, What if you created a page template that included the layout and the permissions you need and then instead of "applying the layout" to multiple pages, you use the page template?
10:36 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> jardineworks_: will check both .war from 5.2.3 and 6.1.2 to see if any differences
10:39 < jardineworks_:#liferay> nicolas_FR, I am wondering is the name is changed. Basically servletcontext_WAR_portletname needs to be the same on both sides right? because the layout will be looking for a plugin with a specific name,
10:39 < jardineworks_:#liferay> I've seen certain maven configurations where the build version gets placed into the deployable file name.
10:41 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> jardineworks_: we're keeping the same name, as we're migrating, we copy/paste most of the things
10:42 < Urug_:#liferay> Looks like removing column-portlet class could do the job, but I am not sure about other consequences.
10:42 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> does the war name counts ?
10:42 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> or only the liferay.properties files ?
10:44 < jardineworks_:#liferay> nicolas_FR, the p_p_id is what I am thinking of.
10:44 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> btw we encounter a boring problem with maven, maybe you can help. In our settings.xml we have properties like <liferay.version>6.1.2</>, which are used in some pom.xml. But our builds fails with "Downloading: http://10.100.11.21:8081/nexus/content/groups/public/com/liferay/portal/util-bridges/${liferay.version}/util-bridges-${liferay.version}.pom"
10:45 < jardineworks_:#liferay> nicolas_FR, is that <liferay.version> set in a <profile/> in your settings.xml?
10:45 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> yes
10:45 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> Can we set the p_p_id ? isn't it liferay-display.xml >  display>category>portlet id="fooName" ?
10:47 < jardineworks_:#liferay> nicolas_FR, the p_p_id is a combination of the servletcontext (what the name of the folder is in webapps) + _WAR_ + the portlet name in the portlet.xml ... this is because you can have multiple portlets in the same servletcontext (portlet.xml)
10:48 < jardineworks_:#liferay> for Maven... if you add a <properties><liferay.version>6.1.2</liferay.version></properties> to the projects pom.xml file, does it work?
10:49 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> jardineworks_: we tried to add the <liferay.version> directly in the pom where it was used and was not working neither
10:50 < jardineworks_:#liferay> nicolas_FR, hmm... I had this problem too once. moving the property seemed to make maven happy but i also found that I wasn't "selecting the profile" in Eclipse when I was creating the maven plugin project.
10:50 < jardineworks_:#liferay> I hate maven so I might now be the best person to ask :)
