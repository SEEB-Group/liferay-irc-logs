04:24 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> hi there
04:28 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> We're migrating from 5.2.3 to 6.1.2 and we have a problem with our portlets. Fact is all our pages are ok, but we're just beginning to migrate the portlets from 5.2.3 to 6.1.2. So atm pages shows "portlet foo is missing or not deployed". We migrated portlet foo, but the pages were still missing the portlet, when we were able to deploy it from the menu "add a portlet". Anything to look forward to get pages to recognize the fresh
09:02 < Urug_:#liferay> I can create Application Display Theme with the type "Documents and Media Template", the question is where can I use this template? Document and Media Portlet does not have an option to set Display Theme (at least in it's configuration, maybe it's possible programatically?).
09:10 < Urug_:#liferay> Oh I see, Media Gallery Portlet has this option. Naming is a little bit confusing I would say.
09:17 < jardineworks_:#liferay> Urug_, naming and nomeclature is not really a strong suit for LR. Layout vs. Page (though both are used) ... Company vs. Portal Instance (though both are used)... Scope Group, Group, Site ... used interchangeably :)
09:17 < jardineworks_:#liferay> you get used to it
09:24 < Urug_:#liferay> yea I had a little hard time with those too
09:30 < Urug_:#liferay> Some glossary page with all these terms compared and explained would help a lot to begginers.
09:34 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> hi there
09:34 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> We're migrating from 5.2.3 to 6.1.2 and we have a problem with our portlets. Fact is all our pages are ok, but we're just beginning to migrate the portlets from 5.2.3 to 6.1.2. So atm pages shows "portlet foo is missing or not deployed".

09:43 < jardineworks_:#liferay> nicolas_FR, interesting. Do the portlets have the same names between versions? Are the WAR files that are generated the same?
09:44 < jardineworks_:#liferay> are any of the portlets instanceable?
09:45 < Urug_:#liferay> When I remove all $processor.processColumn(...) directives from Layout Template I get java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: -1. I need a layout where user can't place any portlets (they are all embedded). Any help?
09:46 < jardineworks_:#liferay> Urug_, leave it in there and set the permissions such that no one is allowed to add portlets
09:46 < jardineworks_:#liferay> :)
10:07 < Urug_:#liferay> Well it would requiere to apply these permissons on each page having this layout and I am not sure if the droplet zone, which creates unnecessary space in the page, would go away.
10:07 < Urug_:#liferay> *dropzone :)
10:09 < jardineworks_:#liferay> Urug_, I don't have a theme handy in front of me, but couldn't you override the css that allows the drop zone? add your own style that removes it and then use that css in that particular layout only?
10:20 < Urug_:#liferay> That's possible, but I am not sure if i like it :)
10:24 < jardineworks_:#liferay> Urug_, pfft... well, next time make sure to mention your are trying to build a pyramid :P
10:26 < Urug_:#liferay> Every time I do something on Liferay I have a feeling that I have to bypass something or do some work arounds.
10:27 < jardineworks_:#liferay> Urug_, that's a glass half empty. Liferay is almost entirely configurable through plugins right? that's not by passing. Case and point, you undeploy your theme and your custom layout template and it goes right back to the way it works OOTB
10:27 < jardineworks_:#liferay> the fact that you can make those kind of changes is part of what makes liferay so powerful if you ask me
10:28 < jardineworks_:#liferay> unlike most other vendors who TELL YOU its customizeable, and then provide you a "special build"
10:31 < Urug_:#liferay> I am not saying it's liferay fault, I am rather worried if I am not doing something wrong just because I don't understand it.
10:32 < jardineworks_:#liferay> Urug_, fair point. The problem with so much flexibility is that there are so many ways to get it done -- so you might spend some time second guessing yourself :)
10:32 < jardineworks_:#liferay> Urug_, What if you created a page template that included the layout and the permissions you need and then instead of "applying the layout" to multiple pages, you use the page template?
10:36 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> jardineworks_: will check both .war from 5.2.3 and 6.1.2 to see if any differences
10:39 < jardineworks_:#liferay> nicolas_FR, I am wondering is the name is changed. Basically servletcontext_WAR_portletname needs to be the same on both sides right? because the layout will be looking for a plugin with a specific name,
10:39 < jardineworks_:#liferay> I've seen certain maven configurations where the build version gets placed into the deployable file name.
10:41 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> jardineworks_: we're keeping the same name, as we're migrating, we copy/paste most of the things
10:42 < Urug_:#liferay> Looks like removing column-portlet class could do the job, but I am not sure about other consequences.
10:42 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> does the war name counts ?
10:42 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> or only the liferay.properties files ?
10:44 < jardineworks_:#liferay> nicolas_FR, the p_p_id is what I am thinking of.
10:44 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> btw we encounter a boring problem with maven, maybe you can help. In our settings.xml we have properties like <liferay.version>6.1.2</>, which are used in some pom.xml. But our builds fails with "Downloading: http://10.100.11.21:8081/nexus/content/groups/public/com/liferay/portal/util-bridges/${liferay.version}/util-bridges-${liferay.version}.pom"
10:45 < jardineworks_:#liferay> nicolas_FR, is that <liferay.version> set in a <profile/> in your settings.xml?
10:45 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> yes
10:45 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> Can we set the p_p_id ? isn't it liferay-display.xml >  display>category>portlet id="fooName" ?
10:47 < jardineworks_:#liferay> nicolas_FR, the p_p_id is a combination of the servletcontext (what the name of the folder is in webapps) + _WAR_ + the portlet name in the portlet.xml ... this is because you can have multiple portlets in the same servletcontext (portlet.xml)
10:48 < jardineworks_:#liferay> for Maven... if you add a <properties><liferay.version>6.1.2</liferay.version></properties> to the projects pom.xml file, does it work?
10:49 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> jardineworks_: we tried to add the <liferay.version> directly in the pom where it was used and was not working neither
10:50 < jardineworks_:#liferay> nicolas_FR, hmm... I had this problem too once. moving the property seemed to make maven happy but i also found that I wasn't "selecting the profile" in Eclipse when I was creating the maven plugin project.
10:50 < jardineworks_:#liferay> I hate maven so I might now be the best person to ask :)
10:50 < jardineworks_:#liferay> hate is a strong word. I prefer not to use it.
10:50 < jardineworks_:#liferay> :D
10:50 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> jardineworks_: well if we use mvn -X or something, we see the active profile is the good one
10:51 < jardineworks_:#liferay> can you share the settings.xml and the pom.xml with me? in a pastie or soemthing?
10:51 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> yep
10:54 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> jardineworks_: this is my .m2/settings.xml : http://pastebin.com/HrQHuN0i
10:56 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> jardineworks_: and this is a pom : http://pastebin.com/dNEr1DhS
10:59 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> jardineworks_: sorry had not validated the captcha. done.
11:00 < jardineworks_:#liferay> nicolas_FR, just doing a compare with some of my own poms one sec.
11:02 < jardineworks_:#liferay> nicolas_FR, I made an update: http://pastebin.com/XR1tiLxF
11:02 < jardineworks_:#liferay> that is normally how I have been doing it
11:02 < jardineworks_:#liferay> in part because my client is not really using maven profiles properly :)
11:03 < jardineworks_:#liferay> but I have all the stuff from the settings.xml actually listed out as properties in the "project" section of the pom.
11:04 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> ok working here too with this conf. We had the liferay.version in a parent pom. Maybe problem with that ?
11:04 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> mine are in the profile section
11:04 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> might be that ?
11:06 < jardineworks_:#liferay> nicolas_FR, not sure to be honest. I'm not a maven pro. I think in our environment (I have yet to merge my code -- and this is part of the reason why!) there is a parent parent parent pom that has these setting in it. Everything is supposed to flow down rather than have them in a project by project config.
11:06 < jardineworks_:#liferay> but I have had a lot of problems with maven -- same as you
11:08 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> =/
11:09 < jardineworks_:#liferay> the parent pom should work though -- as far as I know that is how the other guys at my client do it.
11:11 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> aah, first good new, collegue seems to be able to deploy the war with the exact same name, and now liferay knows it's the same portlet... 1 problem down.
11:14 < jardineworks_:#liferay> \o/
11:16 < jardineworks_:#liferay> Urug_, if you are removing that css class name in your custom layout only then I doubt it will cause any issues anywhere else. Overriding the style altogether, that's a different story of course. :)
11:19 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> anyone already got an issue when migrating from 5.2.3 to 6.x with : "java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: com.sun.faces.config.ConfigureListener" ?
11:21 < Urug_:#liferay> jardineworks_, it showed up that the it's not the the solution and that the problem itself is totally elsewhere
11:22 < Urug_:#liferay> and unfortunately quite random
11:29 < jardineworks_:#liferay> Urug_, sorry man.. that probably sounded a lot better in your mind that it does when typed out. Can you try that last one again? :)
11:29 < jardineworks_:#liferay> but you definitely get an award for the most ambiguous and confusing chat message so far today :)
11:34 < Urug_:#liferay> everything sounds better in my mind :) particularly these voices ...
11:58 < Urug_:#liferay> jardineworks_, so ... at least one processColumn method must be called to deploy working layout, but if I comment out this single processColumn call and let the Eclipse SDK to reload the already deployed layout template, than it works fine ...
12:09 < jardineworks_:#liferay> Urug_, but if you deploy the layout template again yourself, manually, with the commented out line, it fails.
12:10 < jardineworks_:#liferay> Urug_, the more I think about it the more I think you want to have a Page Template for what you are doing. Predefined layout and set of portlets that cannot be changed? that would fall into the Page Template area I think.
12:30 < Urug_:#liferay> In theory it would, but problem with Page Template is that if any changes are made on the template, the pages with this template applied don't update properly - the portlets on these pages loose it's linked content.
12:32 < Urug_:#liferay> And I am working on project where the content is being  continually added while the application is being developed
12:34 < Urug_:#liferay> So any change in template would mean to change hundrets of pages manually.
12:53 < Urug_:#liferay> I will solve this by CSS, it's not such a big deal, but I wonder where this "at least one portlet per layout" premise is coming from.
13:01 < jardineworks_:#liferay> Urug_, I believe there is an option to propogate changes to the template.
13:02 < Urug_:#liferay> It should be possible to create layout without any portlet, shouldn't it? So it makes me wonder .. is it bug, is it intention, or is it my fault..?
13:04 < jardineworks_:#liferay> Urug_, I'm not sure. I guess the argument could be made -- why would you have a layout without even a single portlet?
13:04 < Urug_:#liferay> Yes there is, but as I said, its not propagated correctly.
13:04 < jardineworks_:#liferay> portlets are how content is driven right?
13:08 < Urug_:#liferay> Well there could be a single embedded portlet...
13:09 < jardineworks_:#liferay> Urug_, but I think that is normally done with a Page Template.
13:09 < jardineworks_:#liferay> i see your point
13:09 < jardineworks_:#liferay> though...
13:10 < Urug_:#liferay> try it :) , there are some threads on the forum about this issue as well
13:11 < jardineworks_:#liferay> Urug_, which version of LR are you using?
13:11 < Urug_:#liferay> latest, 6.2
13:12 < jardineworks_:#liferay> Urug_, can you send me the link to the post with the details of what is not working?
13:15 < Urug_:#liferay> https://issues.liferay.com/browse/LPS-32850
13:20 < Urug_:#liferay> it's not like it's not working, it's more like not working as one would expected
14:15 < jardineworks_:#liferay> Urug_, So ... if I understand correctly. You want to create a layout that contains just a bunch of embedded portlets.
14:15 < jardineworks_:#liferay> Urug_, but you can't because not having at least one process column causes an out of bounds
14:16 < jardineworks_:#liferay> Urug_, and you can't have the process column, because if you do, then people can drop other (non embedded portlets) into the page.
14:16 < Urug_:#liferay> yep
14:16 < jardineworks_:#liferay> (layout)
14:16 < jardineworks_:#liferay> hmmm
14:16 < jardineworks_:#liferay> what's the content you are embedding?
14:16 < jardineworks_:#liferay> meaning.. is it just a few hournal articles or something?
14:17 < jardineworks_:#liferay> acutally... nevermind, that wouldn't change anything
14:18 < Urug_:#liferay> i actually have more layouts with various and embedded only portlets
14:19 < Urug_:#liferay> The main reason why i am doing it like this is that page template propagation
14:23 < jardineworks_:#liferay> Urug_, do you have the portal source code handy?
14:27 < Urug_:#liferay> Portal source code handy? I use what's available on web: Developer guide, API, github
14:28 < jardineworks_:#liferay> Urug_, ah ok -- that's fine, I just have it setup as a project in my environment so I can step into the portal source. I'm looking at a class --
14:28 < jardineworks_:#liferay> LayoutTypePortletImpl
