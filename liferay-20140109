06:34 < rrapozo:#liferay> jhf: Are you there? :)
07:39 <@jhf:#liferay> hey rrapozo
07:39 < rrapozo:#liferay> me!!! :D
07:39 <@jhf:#liferay> yes I think so - I think there are a few different issues going on here
07:39 <@jhf:#liferay> first off, which browser are you using?
07:40 < rrapozo:#liferay> I tried with firefox and chromium
07:40 <@jhf:#liferay> hmm ok.. and on firefox, do you see the progress bar at all (even if it does not actually move with the progress)?
