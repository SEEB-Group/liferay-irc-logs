06:31 < webczat:#liferay> Hello!
06:32 < webczat:#liferay> I have a problem with liferay-6.2 GA1, ldap does not work for me and I also cannot access server admin pages.
07:08 < webczat:#liferay> I heart the last one was fixed but either it the bug returned or this was another version. I still get NamingException about object not being a context
07:09 < webczat:#liferay> and also required ldap auth is not enforced, at least not on the default admin account from portal-ext.properties... unless this admin account can always login with his password no matter what?
07:44 < webczat:#liferay> ...
08:45 < webczat:#liferay> how to build a war?
09:19 < webczat:#liferay> hmm, it doesn't work even after checking it out from git and compiling
09:19 < webczat:#liferay> like ldap. still the same error when testing users. wrrr
09:19 < webczat:#liferay> and still cannot access the server admin pages except the first
13:05 < webczat:#liferay> Hello. I have ldap enabled in liferay 6.2 ga, the problem is that it actually does not work. user export works, import causes an exception and authentication probably does not occur at all. wtf? like I now have slapd running with max debug and even though ldap is enabled, it is not possible to authenticate and I don't see anyy ldap connection coming
