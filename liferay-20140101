06:31 < webczat:#liferay> Hello!
06:32 < webczat:#liferay> I have a problem with liferay-6.2 GA1, ldap does not work for me and I also cannot access server admin pages.
07:08 < webczat:#liferay> I heart the last one was fixed but either it the bug returned or this was another version. I still get NamingException about object not being a context
