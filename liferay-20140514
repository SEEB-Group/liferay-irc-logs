05:59 < Axxell> Hi guys, im trying to find out how to make content in a custom portlet searchable trough liferays standard search. The portlets gets its data from ldap and is not stored in a db. I need to add the data to the lucene index and somehow tell liferay to point to the right page when searching
06:00 < Axxell> Does anyone have a link to an example how to do this? Or a somewhat complete instruction how to get it done?
07:07 < alex_> hi! I dont have "File Upload" on my metadata fields on Liferay 6.2.  Does anyone know if was removed? 6.1 used to have it as this screenshot suggests https://www.liferay.com/c/document_library/get_file?groupId=14&uuid=df661c27-fdbe-49db-9803-d14aa4d00603
