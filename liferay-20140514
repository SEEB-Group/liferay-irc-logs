05:59 < Axxell> Hi guys, im trying to find out how to make content in a custom portlet searchable trough liferays standard search. The portlets gets its data from ldap and is not stored in a db. I need to add the data to the lucene index and somehow tell liferay to point to the right page when searching
06:00 < Axxell> Does anyone have a link to an example how to do this? Or a somewhat complete instruction how to get it done?
07:07 < alex_> hi! I dont have "File Upload" on my metadata fields on Liferay 6.2.  Does anyone know if was removed? 6.1 used to have it as this screenshot suggests https://www.liferay.com/c/document_library/get_file?groupId=14&uuid=df661c27-fdbe-49db-9803-d14aa4d00603
07:18 < Axxell> Ive found some examples of a custom asset in liferay, a little unsure though how things work? can i just add an asset of any made upp class? If i make a class to hold the data of my content? Does liferay automaticly index added assets? Do i need to make custom indexer for it to be able to find my asset in the search?
09:22 < bijoo_> Naenyn: yes, that would work; examples are there too.
09:51 < bijoo_> alex_ yes it seems it was taken out some point ./portal-web/docroot/html/portlet/dynamic_data_mapping/js/main.js
09:51 < bijoo_> Axxell look into liferay-portlet.xml
16:39 < Naenyn> bijoo_: it appears that my user stays logged in when returning empty credentials. =( digging more...
17:27 < bijoo_> Naenyn: do they have SSO browser cookies? Could it be other filter's logging them?
