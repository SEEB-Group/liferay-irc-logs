09:36 < bijoo_> queaker: may you post whole stack trace pastebin.com?
10:15 < queaker> hi bijoo
10:15 < queaker> i will do
10:15 < queaker> i’m now on the second modification of the „hello world“-portlet
10:16 < queaker> http://pastebin.com/HQXahWFC
10:17 < queaker> i moved the pref.save() call from the jsp filte to the MyGreetingPortlet class, as described in http://www.liferay.com/de/documentation/liferay-portal/6.2/development/-/ai/understand-portlet-execution-phases-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-03-en
10:17 < queaker> but now i got the save exception calling prefs.save() issued fromt the MyGreetingPortlet, instead from the jsp file
10:17 < queaker> save == same
10:18 < queaker> com.liferay.samples.MyGreetingPortlet.processAction(MyGreetingPortlet.java:20)  contails the line „prefs.store();“

11:29 < jardineworks> whats the stacktrace in the log?
11:29 < DotHack> no stacktrace
11:29 < jardineworks> (pastebin though.. don't dump it in here :) )
11:29 < jardineworks> hmm
11:29 < jardineworks> DotHack, what do you mean you "deleted the login page"
11:30 < DotHack> jardineworks: actually.. i was clicking around (demo)
11:31 < DotHack> jardineworks: so i dont really know whether i deleted something or not
11:31 < jardineworks> well, if you didn't click a button labeled delete -- then you probably didn't delete anything :)
11:32 < jardineworks> DotHack ... any way to get that url with the parameters in a legible format?
11:33 < jardineworks> DotHack, Actually... let me backup. This is a demo site? so it's just on your local with nothing in it?
11:33 < DotHack> just empty site for me to experiment in.. community edition
11:34 < DotHack> this happened when i signed out
11:34 < jardineworks> hypersonic? or have you configured a db?
11:34 < DotHack> hypersonic
11:34 < jardineworks> just stop the portal, delete the hypersonic file and restart the portal. That should reset everything.
11:34 < DotHack> ok
