10:13 < jardineworks_:#liferay> I have a liferay design question for the experts -- jhf, rotty3000 topolik -- if you guys are around?
10:15 < jardineworks_:#liferay> I am assuming that there is a disadvantage to have too many plugins (individual deployments) other than clutter. If I have 5 portlets all deployed in the same package, will that consume fewer resources then 5 individual deployment packages?
10:21 < topolik:#liferay> jardineworks_: in general yes, each web application has separate "context" ... filters, servlets, sessions + probably the worst are own JAR files, which are isolated by own classloader and loaded into memory
10:23 < topolik:#liferay> the good thing about separate packages is versioning+deployment - you don't need to redeploy all portlets when fixing small bug in one of them
