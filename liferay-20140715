02:02 < goku_:#liferay> hi ,how to access user custom fields from liferay theme velocity template ?
04:52 < sl33k:#liferay> hi guys
04:55 < sl33k:#liferay> a colleague of mine wants to know how liferay works in a ldap authentication situation
04:56 < sl33k:#liferay> a scenario where someone with email already exists in liferay db and same exists in Active directory

08:18 < goku_:#liferay> which jsp file is used to render the add user page inside the control panel?
08:34 < rocknroll_:#liferay> goku_: .. html/portlet/users_admin/edit_user.js
08:34 < rocknroll_:#liferay> p
08:35 < rocknroll_:#liferay> whats the logic behind the message board "threads: previous|next"
08:36 < rocknroll_:#liferay> it keeps skipping threads randomly
09:58 < Yam`:#liferay> is there a plugin or something to change the colors easily? I want to change the blue buttons (like those with "My site" and the notifications) to red ones but I don't find what to change in the CSS
11:06 < jardineworks:#liferay> Yam``, icon-plus, icon-desktop, icon-edit are the three css styles you need to override.
11:26 < Yam``:#liferay> jardineworks, thx :)

12:43 < jrmiah:#liferay> has anyone here ever built liferay from source?
12:53 < jrmiah:#liferay> uhhh does anyone watch this channel?
12:53 < jrmiah:#liferay> its 9:52am in LA someone should be awake ;)
13:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> jrmiah, did you see the messages I sent you yesterday?
13:14 < jrmiah:#liferay> jardineworks: i see some references in my /last log to JHF

14:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> jrmiah, https://www.liferay.com/community/wiki/-/wiki/Main/BugSquad+-+Liferay+Portal+6.2+CE+Milestone+6+Testing#section-BugSquad+-+Liferay+Portal+6.2+CE+Milestone+6+Testing-Building+Portal+and+Plugins+Manually
14:15 < jrmiah:#liferay> lets try this :)
14:29 < jrmiah:#liferay> same issues
14:33 < jrmiah:#liferay> for some reason these scripts arent able to resolve java.nio.Charbuffer and other standard libes
14:33 < jrmiah:#liferay> libs*
14:36 < jrmiah:#liferay> do these steps work for you?

14:38 < jrmiah:#liferay> so forgetting this for a second, what about just building and installing a simple portlet that can be added onto a deployment of liferay...
14:39 < jrmiah:#liferay> i guess i could just build hello world but my issue is like ... at plumtree where I was the tools / release manager (yup thats true), we had remote portlets .... JSR286 and stuff isnt tht interesting cuz it needs a container which is a portal too.
14:40 < jrmiah:#liferay> I guess there might be pluto .. but liferay doesnt seem to be that straightforward. Plumtree portal you could install, be up and running in an hour and write a remote portlet in about 10 minutes even with dynamic tags heh
14:40 < jrmiah:#liferay> that would be the best thing ultimately ... is there an easy way to do that scenario? this is really for a demo of a multi-tiered application
14:49 < jrmiah:#liferay> considering that script 1/3 down _doesnt actually run on 2 separate machines_ - how does one logically go from there?

15:38 < jardineworks:#liferay> jrmiah, most people download the bundle from liferay. Unpack it, start the server. 5 minutes and your done.
