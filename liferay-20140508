03:38 < alex______> bijoo_: With a light delay (timezones!) here it is: http://hastebin.com/ohoyequday.avrasm
07:45 < alex______> Can anyone please help with this error http://hastebin.com/ohoyequday.avrasm
07:53 < bijoo_> alex______: did you do anything to database?
07:53 < bijoo_> alex______: DLAppLocalServiceUtil.getFileEntry
07:53 < bijoo_> alex______: it's trying to get a file over there; but the repositoryId's wrong
07:54 < bijoo_> com.liferay.portal.util.SubscriptionSender.hasPermission
07:54 < bijoo_> And looks like getting file for permissions
07:54 < bijoo_> To see if it has certain permission
07:56 < bijoo_> In 6.1GA2 it is this:
07:56 < bijoo_> 		PermissionChecker permissionChecker =
07:56 < bijoo_> 			PermissionCheckerFactoryUtil.create(user);
07:56 < bijoo_> 		return SubscriptionPermissionUtil.contains(
07:56 < bijoo_> 			permissionChecker, subscription.getClassName(),
07:56 < bijoo_> 			subscription.getClassPK());
07:58 < bijoo_> Naenyn: That's where the *ThreadLocal comes in; see our conversation from two weeks back:
07:58 < bijoo_> http://liferay.seebgroup.com/irc/liferay-20140427
07:58 < bijoo_> http://liferay.seebgroup.com/irc/liferay-20140425
07:58 < bijoo_> http://liferay.seebgroup.com/irc/liferay-20140427
07:58 < bijoo_> http://liferay.seebgroup.com/irc/liferay-20140428 **
08:48 < alex______> bijoo_: I have not touched the database! I get this error every time someone uploads a new document and it tries to send an email (because I have subscribed to the folder)
09:48 < bijoo_> alex______: can you try unsubscribe then resubscribe?
09:49 < alex______> bijoo_: I did ... its the same.
09:50 < alex______> I get the error and of course, no email
09:52 < alex______> bijoo_: In a blog entry though, the subscription works. I get both mail and RSS (and no error)
10:00 < aj_> bijoo_,  any chance you know of an easy way to change the lucene default OR or search terms to an AND?
10:01 < aj_> KeywordAnalyzer modification in the spring-search.xml might do it... but I was hoping for something the did not require an ext plugin.
13:48 < Naenyn> bijoo_: I'm not sure that is entirely correct tho? I mean.. as it stands right now, my custom authenticator doesn't even fire unless liferay already knows who the user is beforehand. That leads me to believe that the filter has to return the user's identity.
14:21 < bijoo_> aj_: I'm looking into it; one sec.
14:41 < bijoo_> aj_: com.liferay.portal.kernel.search.SearchContext.setAndSearch(boolean) ?
14:42 < bijoo_> aj_: not sure if that is what you're looking for; but if it is, then hook override this: /html/portlet/search/main_search.jspf
14:51 < bijoo_> Naenyn: you are right; my mistake here; that's right.
14:51 < bijoo_> Naenyn: forgo  talking about AutoLogin; other's true in case of a plain filter.
14:53 < bijoo_> forgot*
15:55 < Naenyn> bijoo_: Actually I wasn't sure if I needed an autologin or not. Do I? And what does the filter need to do/return? I need a good filter example...
16:11 < Naenyn> hm.. not understanding how autologin works with respect to the auth pipeline..
16:13 < haba713> hi! i have two aui:buttons in portlet page with different names but name attributes aren't rendered to html button. how can i determine in portlet action, which one of the buttons was clicked?
