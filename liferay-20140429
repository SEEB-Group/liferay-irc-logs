04:28 < sm`> morning all!
09:04 -!- mode/#liferay [+o rotty3000] by ChanServ
09:38 < sm`> Anyone around?
09:38 < sm`> https://www.liferay.com/community/forums/-/message_boards/message/37293340
09:38 < sm`> still cant get this Spring REST service to work
09:38 < sm`> FFS
09:39 < sm`> 13:34:35,966 INFO  [DefaultAnnotationHandlerMapping:411] Mapped URL path [/api/hello] onto handler 'storeFinderApi'
09:39 < sm`> 13:34:35,967 INFO  [DefaultAnnotationHandlerMapping:411] Mapped URL path [/api/hello.*] onto handler 'storeFinderApi'
09:39 < sm`> 13:34:35,967 INFO  [DefaultAnnotationHandlerMapping:411] Mapped URL path [/api/hello/] onto handler 'storeFinderApi'
09:39 < sm`> 13:34:35,967 INFO  [DefaultAnnotationHandlerMapping:411] Mapped URL path [/api] onto handler 'storeFinderApi'
09:39 < sm`> 13:34:35,967 INFO  [DefaultAnnotationHandlerMapping:411] Mapped URL path [/api.*] onto handler 'storeFinderApi'
09:39 < sm`> everything looks fine on deploymed
09:39 < sm`> the urls are mapped
09:39 < sm`> but all i get is 405 errors
09:39 < sm`> and the methods are specifically set as GET
09:52 < sm`> FUCK ME
09:52 < sm`> i fixed it by using the spring dispatcher
09:52 < sm`> everything else in this config is pure spring
09:52 < sm`> so why i dont need the PortalDispatcher here
09:52 < sm`> <servlet-class>
09:52 < sm`> 		    org.springframework.web.servlet.DispatcherServlet
09:52 < sm`> 		  </servlet-class>
09:52 < sm`> jeez
10:05 < bijoo_> sm`: oh! just had to use ServletDispatcher!
10:05 < bijoo_> sm`: wow that is the type of thing that real hurts; but it's a great note for future self there.
10:10 < sm`> it does
10:10 < sm`> http://www.liferay.com/web/vitor.silva/blog/-/blogs/using-restful-services-with-liferay
10:10 < sm`> this one service regarding this kind of thing
10:10 < sm`> is waaaaay to complicated
10:11 < sm`> when ill have some free time ill try wrap the setup in a simple tutorial
10:11 < sm`> too*

14:05 < Naenyn> bijoo_: Regarding the custom authenticator, it is just a hook with with a barebones liferay-hook.xml, right? and then a portal-ext.properties entry that adds the auth class to the pre-auth list?
14:07 < Naenyn> bijoo_: rotty3000: also, when I eventually migrate our users to use the new auth system, I was planning on setting each user's uuid in liferay to the uuid of their user in the external system. Do you see any problem with this?
16:36 -!- mode/#liferay [+o jhf] by ChanServ
17:29 < bijoo_> Naenyn: on first point, hook can do the latter. Note the portal-trunk/definitions/liferay-hook_6*.dtd
17:29 < bijoo_> auth.pipeline.pre
17:30 < bijoo_> Naenyn: on the second point; why would you use that? It seems an internal field here, no? Why not use custom attribute or else? Also can define SB Entity.
17:39 < Naenyn> bijoo_: because I need to be able to search users by the value I get back from our external auth system. hm, I suppose I could search by another field.
17:40 < Naenyn> bijoo_: have you ever configured CAS support in Liferay before? The tooltips for Server Name, Server URL, and Service URL don't match the error messages.. confusing.
18:04 < Naenyn> jhf: is there anyone around that can clarify Liferay's CAS configuration options? The tooltips don't seem to match the error messages.. and in some examples I'm seeing in google, there are parameters that aren't accounted for in the UI in the control panel..
18:06 < Naenyn> the login, logout, and no such user urls are straightforward, but the server name, server url, and service urls are not .. and it looks like there is also a cas.validate.url and a cas url prefix..
18:06 < bijoo_> Naenyn: no I haven't setup CAS before there; but I've usd Open SSO a lot.
18:07 < bijoo_> Naenyn: best to check the source code for exact there.
18:16 < Naenyn> the worst part of this is I had it working at one point.. =|
18:28 <@jhf> Naenyn: I have no experience, with CAS ,but lemme see if I can find anythign. I know we have many customers and community members using it, so “it should work” :)
18:31 <@jhf> also are you in 6.1 or 6.2?
20:18 < Naenyn> jhf: 6.1 GA2
