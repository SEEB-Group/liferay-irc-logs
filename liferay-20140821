12:47 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey jhf you around for a quick question?
12:47 < jardineworks:#liferay> at least I think its quick :)
12:47 < jardineworks:#liferay> but since I don't know the answer, maybe I shouldn't assume that
12:49 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, I am working on the localized virtualhost name thing. I'm not a surgeon, but it feels a lot like open heart surgery at the moment :). I have a few things cooking now and I am about to reroute some arteries. The LayoutSet, is that the model for the "site template"?
12:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> hmmm
12:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> "Each layout is a member of layout set (com.liferay.portal.model.LayoutSet). A layout set represents a group of layout pages, and thus a layout set can be thought of as a "web site", or more specifically, a "portal instance." Since each user has a private group associated with them, this allows each individual user to maintain their own custom portal."
12:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> so then why is the layout set always 0?
13:35 < jardineworks:#liferay> does anyone know what this is? -->  aQute.bnd.annotation.ProviderType
13:58 < bwood:#liferay> any advice explaining dropdown child menu's in 6.2 there is alot that doesn't make sense
14:49 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo, you around and kickin'?
16:18 <@jhf:#liferay> hey everyone - in just 43 minutes weâ€™re going to have a very interesting developer hangout featuring the one and only rotty3000 (a regular IRC denizen) - he will be coming to you live from Liferay HQ and talking about the future of Liferay development with Liferay 7 & OSGi
