05:59 < modd_:#liferay> can I get the source for Liferay Enterprise Portal 5.0.1 anywhere? the best I can find is 5.1.3
06:40 < sl33k:#liferay> how is liferay support for a multi-portlet maven project?
07:01 < topolik:#liferay> modd_: I think if you are the EE customer you could try to create a LESA ticket and request the sources. But I'm not sure if it's valid, I think 5.0 hit EOL already
07:06 < modd_:#liferay> afaik 5.0.1 is a RC^^
07:06 < modd_:#liferay> but nevermind, I've solved my problem without the source
08:47 < sm`pid:#liferay> hello all
08:47 < sm`pid:#liferay> still with this same problem
08:47 < sm`pid:#liferay> https://www.liferay.com/community/forums/-/message_boards/message/38428567
08:47 < sm`pid:#liferay> anyone around?

10:09 < sl33k:#liferay> anyone with some experience with liferay + spring mvc
10:40 < sm`pid1:#liferay> sl33k i know a thing or two
10:40 < sm`pid1:#liferay> used spring + hibernate instead of service builder
10:52 < sl33k:#liferay> sm`: hey man
10:53 < sl33k:#liferay> sm`: still there? basically, i have a multi-portlet project architechture, want to use spring + hibernate also, thats my usual stack outside liferay
10:54 < sl33k:#liferay> sm`: also, i  dont want to have to maintain several applicationContext per portlet, e.g foo-portlet.xml, bar-portlet.xml, etc
10:54 < sl33k:#liferay> but the blocker for this is, I dont see how I can explicitly tie a Portlet to a specific Controller to handle its view!
10:54 < sl33k:#liferay> sm`: do you follow?
11:09 < sm`:#liferay> sl33k: yeah got you
