05:59 < modd_:#liferay> can I get the source for Liferay Enterprise Portal 5.0.1 anywhere? the best I can find is 5.1.3
06:40 < sl33k:#liferay> how is liferay support for a multi-portlet maven project?
07:01 < topolik:#liferay> modd_: I think if you are the EE customer you could try to create a LESA ticket and request the sources. But I'm not sure if it's valid, I think 5.0 hit EOL already
07:06 < modd_:#liferay> afaik 5.0.1 is a RC^^
07:06 < modd_:#liferay> but nevermind, I've solved my problem without the source
08:47 < sm`pid:#liferay> hello all
08:47 < sm`pid:#liferay> still with this same problem
08:47 < sm`pid:#liferay> https://www.liferay.com/community/forums/-/message_boards/message/38428567
08:47 < sm`pid:#liferay> anyone around?
09:12 -!- mode/#liferay [+o jhf] by ChanServ
10:09 < sl33k:#liferay> anyone with some experience with liferay + spring mvc
10:40 < sm`pid1:#liferay> sl33k i know a thing or two
10:40 < sm`pid1:#liferay> used spring + hibernate instead of service builder
10:52 < sl33k:#liferay> sm`: hey man
10:53 < sl33k:#liferay> sm`: still there? basically, i have a multi-portlet project architechture, want to use spring + hibernate also, thats my usual stack outside liferay
10:54 < sl33k:#liferay> sm`: also, i  dont want to have to maintain several applicationContext per portlet, e.g foo-portlet.xml, bar-portlet.xml, etc
10:54 < sl33k:#liferay> but the blocker for this is, I dont see how I can explicitly tie a Portlet to a specific Controller to handle its view!
10:54 < sl33k:#liferay> sm`: do you follow?
11:09 < sm`:#liferay> sl33k: yeah got you
11:09 < sm`:#liferay> im in a middle of something
11:09 < sm`:#liferay> ill write you later
11:09 < sm`:#liferay> sry
11:10 < sm`:#liferay> i believe you can have one liferay-portlet.xml
11:10 < sm`:#liferay> and one applicationContent
11:10 < sm`:#liferay> .xml
11:11 < sm`:#liferay> you can scan your pkg from there
11:11 < sm`:#liferay> like
11:11 < sm`:#liferay> 	<context:annotation-config />
11:11 < sm`:#liferay> 	<context:component-scan base-package="com.your.pkg" />
11:16 < sl33k:#liferay> sm`: but how does the portlet know which controller class to use when there are multiple?
11:58 < sm`:#liferay> well you'll change the default 'portlet-class' to  DispatcherPortlet

11:59 < sm`:#liferay> wait i think i have few resources in bookmarks

11:59 < modd:#liferay> hi jhf. do you know about any implementation which allows friendlyURLs look like this: host:port/web/site/childsite/page/childpage ?
12:00 < sm`:#liferay> http://www.effectiveui.com/blog/2013/09/17/liferay-and-spring-mvc/
12:04 <@jhf:#liferay> modd: I donâ€™t know of specific examples, I just know that it is possible :)
12:04 <@jhf:#liferay> worst case, you can use things like apache redirects or URL rewriting
12:05 < modd:#liferay> well, I know that it's possible, I did it, but I'm not sure, if this is the best way to go^^
