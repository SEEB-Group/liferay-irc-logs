21:37 < jermz:#liferay> Salutations! I'm asking for pointers to help about implementing the inevitable (i.e. someone's going to ask for it) proxy portal...
21:39 < jermz:#liferay> (as in : make that site's content appear to be part of this site)
21:43 < jermz:#liferay> no, i'm not asking for the illegal: same entity running both servers, which begs the question - can't liferay do both interfaces?
21:43 < jermz:#liferay> i think it can
21:44 < jermz:#liferay> i'm pretty sure the users don't want to learn both
22:09 < jermz:#liferay> even when it's completely legal you cower. that's not a good sign.
22:09 < jermz:#liferay> so what does "portal" mean?
