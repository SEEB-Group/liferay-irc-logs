05:58 < rrapozo:#liferay> Hello everyone
05:59 < rrapozo:#liferay> Someone understand about the redirect to status.jsp? If yes, can help me. :- )
06:20 < rrapozo:#liferay> Hello someone there?
06:26 -!- mode/#liferay [+o jhf] by ChanServ
06:43 <@jhf:#liferay> hey rrapozo - can you see this?
06:44 < rrapozo:#liferay> Yes!!!
06:44 < rrapozo:#liferay> And you?
06:44 <@jhf:#liferay> yep I see it now :)
06:44 <@jhf:#liferay> welcome to our hangout!
06:44 < rrapozo:#liferay> Thanks!!! :D
06:45 < rrapozo:#liferay> Do you saw my question?
06:46 < rrapozo:#liferay> I don't know if you are a programmer! :)
06:46 < rrapozo:#liferay> Someone understand about the redirect to status.jsp? is a page to handle errors.
07:07 < modd_:#liferay> hangout?
07:08 < modd_:#liferay> rrapozo: not sure, maybe it's redirecting to the status page if non servlet filter etc will match the requested path
07:11 <@jhf:#liferay> There are also some handy links I've found via google: https://www.liferay.com/community/forums/-/message_boards/message/11279721 and http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13864162/how-to-intercept-error-request-and-redirect-to-a-custom-page I think the easiest is a JSP hook to override Liferay's built-in 404.jsp
07:11 <@jhf:#liferay> modd_: sorry - I shouldn't mix hangout with IRC room
07:11 <@jhf:#liferay> :)
07:11 < rrapozo:#liferay> modd_: Thanks for the answer. I can redirect but before redirect show for 5 seconds a page.
07:11 < modd_:#liferay> good to have you here jhf!
07:12 < modd_:#liferay> I have to do the liferay dev certification tomorrow
07:12 < modd_:#liferay> what secret information do you have? ^^
07:13 < rrapozo:#liferay> jhf: the 404 error is more easy because is just put it "layout.friendly.url.page.not.found=/html/portal/404.jsp" on :q
07:13 < rrapozo:#liferay> on portal-ext.properties
07:14 < rrapozo:#liferay> sorry vi skills :P
07:14 <@jhf:#liferay> hahahah.. good luck! the only thing I've heard is that it has a lot of specific questions related to backend development, not so much frontend. but i've not seen the test! so it might have been updated.
07:14 < rrapozo:#liferay> good luck modd_
07:15 < modd_:#liferay> so liferay staff don't have to do the liferay certification? is it a good sign or rather a bad one? ;)
07:15 < rrapozo:#liferay> So my problem is with the 403 errors (forbidden)
07:16 <@jhf:#liferay> modd_: many do, but it's not a requirement
07:16 <@jhf:#liferay> pretty sure I would fail it. I do more frontend tinkering
07:17 < modd_:#liferay> -.-
07:17 < modd_:#liferay> afaik it's pretty hard
07:18 < modd_:#liferay> would be a nice one if I fail after beeing a pulse award winner^^
07:20 < modd_:#liferay> does the plan for the unconference already exist? I think I have some slot but don't know when and in with form I have to do my presentation/whatever :\
07:47 < winem_:#liferay> hello, do you know the situation when a colleague steps in and says "I've done something stupid..."? happened a sec ago..
07:47 < winem_:#liferay> the edit controls does no longer appear on our website. does this mean that he has removed the css or something like this?
07:48 < winem_:#liferay> we can login into liferay and the edit controls disappear when I click on My Sites and choose one
07:52 < winem_:#liferay> how can I "re-enable" those control fields?
07:57 < urug_:#liferay> how to obtain asset entry title from web content structure template?
07:58 < urug_:#liferay> all structure's field references are present, but no reference to asset entry
08:03 < winem_:#liferay> anyone an idea how I can get the dock bar on the top back?
08:03 < modd_:#liferay> winem_: what did he do?
08:03 < modd_:#liferay> sonds like an js problem
08:04 < modd_:#liferay> does it happen on every page? like control panel too?
08:04 < winem_:#liferay> still waiting for his response.. his job was to fix 2 small css and maybe js issues on the website
08:04 < winem_:#liferay> no, not on the control panel
08:04 < modd_:#liferay> so only on that one page or on every page with the same theme
08:04 < modd_:#liferay> ?
08:05 < winem_:#liferay> there is only one page at the moment
08:05 < winem_:#liferay> wait, I think there should be a 2nd one... the proof of concept, let me check
08:05 < modd_:#liferay> go to control panel, open that site, go to that page and check if he added some js to the page
08:07 < modd_:#liferay> urug_: an asset entry is not tied to a web content structure template. first of all, an blog entry is a asset entry, too
08:07 < winem_:#liferay> I see 6 javascripts in firebug
08:07 < modd_:#liferay> so to be specific, you want the journal article, which uses a certain template?
08:08 < modd_:#liferay> winem_: what kind of errors?
08:08 < modd_:#liferay> it might be a faulty js in some of the portlets of the page, too
08:08 < modd_:#liferay> so again, what did he do?^^
08:11 < winem_:#liferay> I'm just the stupid admin who tries to fix it by himself because the developer is not able to answer this question ^^
08:11 < winem_:#liferay> do you have any idea on how to find the cause? I can tell you the URL..
08:11 < modd_:#liferay> do you know what exactly he was developing?
08:12 < modd_:#liferay> I can have a quick peek, sure
08:15 < urug_:#liferay> modd_, To be specific I have Book structure with field "Name", but from the user perspective the asset title and book's name is always the same and thus unnecessary duplicity. So I removed the name field and used the title in asset publisher template (new display type created by hook), but realized that I can't obtain asset title from structure template for book's detail view.
08:37 < modd_:#liferay> urug_: so, you had a field "Name" additionally to the existing "Title". you dropped the "Name" again and now you cannot use "Title" in your template!?
08:45 < urug_:#liferay> modd_, basically ... ("Title" is asset title, requiered field for every asset entry)
08:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> winem_, #dockbar()
08:47 < jardineworks:#liferay> winem_, but you should wrap it in a check to make sure the use is signed in... one sec.
08:47 < winem_:#liferay> it's not really commented out?
08:47 < winem_:#liferay> oh ok, sure. but isn't it the default behaviour for liferay?
08:48 < jardineworks:#liferay> winem_, nope, but there is a velocity var for it... I think its #if $is_signed_in
08:48 < modd_:#liferay> that's what the default styling does
08:49 < jardineworks:#liferay> winem_, yeah -- in the init.vm you can see -- #set ($is_signed_in = $theme_display.isSignedIn())
08:50 < jardineworks:#liferay> winem_, if the code is still there in the template (usually the portal_normal.vm -- assuming you are using velocity) then it could be that he has a css override that is hiding it.
08:51 < winem_:#liferay> ok, this complies with 2 of the threads in the community. but they used liferay 6.1 and said that there were several changes on the dockbar and the init.vm / init_custom.vm
08:52 < jardineworks:#liferay> winem_, in the master liferay branch, they have just -- #dockbar()
08:52 < jardineworks:#liferay> so maybe the dockbar macro now does the user signed in check
08:53 < rrapozo:#liferay> Hey someone understand about of 403 errors in liferay I want redirect my page when I get this error.
08:53 < winem_:#liferay> a 403 from liferay or any apache in front of it?
08:54 < rrapozo:#liferay> from liferay
08:54 < rrapozo:#liferay> I know that handle the 404 is easy but my problem know is with 403
08:56 < rrapozo:#liferay> I used the status.jsp to handle it but in somewhere it render a page default error for few seconds before redirect to homepage and it is so ugly
08:58 < jardineworks:#liferay> rrapozo, I think you can define an error code in the web.xml
08:59 < jardineworks:#liferay> <error-page><error-code>403</error-code><location>/403.jsp</location></error-page>
08:59 < jardineworks:#liferay> but to add it to Liferays web.xml would require an EXT plugin
08:59 < rrapozo:#liferay> I'm using hook
08:59 < jardineworks:#liferay> probably better to handle it with a fronting proxy.
08:59 < rrapozo:#liferay> It's enought?
09:00 < jardineworks:#liferay> rrapozo, a hook won't modify the web.xml of the ROOT application
09:00 < rrapozo:#liferay> Ok, I will find how I can use ext plugin
09:00 < rrapozo:#liferay> What do you want say with fronting proxy? Apache tomcat?
09:00 < jardineworks:#liferay> rrapozo, ... I've never checked, but any chance that the status.jsp is also called when a 403 occurs?
09:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> becuase if so then you might be able to check the error code in some branch logic and handle it there.
09:02 < rrapozo:#liferay> jardineworks: Yes but the problem is before call this page in somewhere is redered a page error for few seconds and it so ugly in liferay
09:03 < jardineworks:#liferay> rrapozo, ah... I think that is the ROOT/html/common/error.jsp ... in which can you CAN use a hook, a JSP Override and style it however you like.
09:06 < rrapozo:#liferay> I'll try it now!!! :D thanks a lot jardineworks
09:06 < jardineworks:#liferay> rrapozo, sure thing... if it doesn't work, let me know.

13:22 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, got a second for a question?
13:22 <@jhf:#liferay> I am here to serve!
13:24 < jardineworks:#liferay> need to pm you -- client stuff
13:24 <@jhf:#liferay> k
22:38 < urug_:#liferay> anyone still here?
22:40 < urug_:#liferay> How to get DDMContent ID in structure template?
22:53 < urug_:#liferay> or Structure ID so I could at least query for content with that structure
23:00 < jardineworks:#liferay> urug_, I think someone else was in here the other day asking that
23:00 < jardineworks:#liferay> something changed in 6.2
23:00 < jardineworks:#liferay> I can't recall the entire conversation though...
23:00 < jardineworks:#liferay> it's not pretty but you could do -- DDMStructureLocalServiceUtil.getStructures() ... and then loop over them looking for the one with your structure name
23:07 < urug_:#liferay> jardineworks, by chance don't you know where the freemarker/valocity variables are passed to structure template?
23:08 < jardineworks:#liferay> urug_, the core ones that Liferay provides?
23:08 < urug_:#liferay> yep
23:08 < urug_:#liferay> it might be easier to customize it
23:08 < urug_:#liferay> all strucutre fields are rpesent I don't see a reason why ID couln't be present as well
23:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> you are trying to get the structure ID in the web content template?
23:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> urug_, good question -- not sure. Again, a lot of this was moved in 6.2
23:13 < jardineworks:#liferay> urug_, for example.. the stuff in the theme is now in a file called TemplateContextHelper ... whose name has no reference to templating language.
23:13 < urug_:#liferay> the problem I am trying to solve is, that in my structure template I need a button with a redirect to page with a form and that form needs an access to asset/article/conent from which it was redirected
23:14 < urug_:#liferay> so I need to pass some ID to that form, but first I need to obtain that ID in template so I can create that redirect button
23:15 < jardineworks:#liferay> i see
23:16 < jardineworks:#liferay> so basically... article ID 1234 ... has structure id 56 and template id 78 ... I am looking at the web content portlet with article 1234 in it, and then I click the button, and I go to a form with the details of 1234 that can be edited?
23:16 < jardineworks:#liferay> $reserved-article-id -- will contain the id for the article in the template.
23:16 < jardineworks:#liferay> does that help?
23:17 < urug_:#liferay> I will try...
23:18 < jardineworks:#liferay> there are several "reserved" tokens -- https://www.liferay.com/community/wiki/-/wiki/Main/CMS+Internal+API
23:20 < urug_:#liferay> ${reserved-article-id} undefined, ${reservedArticleId} as well (most of the variables uses camel case now)
23:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> its not ${reserverd-article-id} ... its $reserved-article-id.data
23:22 < jardineworks:#liferay> I am assuming you are in velocity right?
23:22 < urug_:#liferay> FM
23:22 < jardineworks:#liferay> ah -- not sure about FM
23:24 < jardineworks:#liferay> urug_, try using this -- https://gist.github.com/jamesfalkner/8832377
23:24 < jardineworks:#liferay> to dump all the vars
23:25 < urug_:#liferay> hey i totally forget about that one :)
23:26 < jardineworks:#liferay> urug_, its pretty late where I am so I'm going to shutdown. Best of luck.
23:27 < urug_:#liferay> thanks, gn, here is 5:26am
23:27 < jardineworks:#liferay> holy jesus..
23:27 < jardineworks:#liferay> go to bed man! you're not curing cancer :)
23:27 < urug_:#liferay> :)
23:29 < jardineworks:#liferay> wait...
23:29 < jardineworks:#liferay> are you curing cancer? :)
