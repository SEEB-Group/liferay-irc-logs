05:58 < rrapozo:#liferay> Hello everyone
05:59 < rrapozo:#liferay> Someone understand about the redirect to status.jsp? If yes, can help me. :- )
06:20 < rrapozo:#liferay> Hello someone there?
06:26 -!- mode/#liferay [+o jhf] by ChanServ
06:43 <@jhf:#liferay> hey rrapozo - can you see this?
06:44 < rrapozo:#liferay> Yes!!!
06:44 < rrapozo:#liferay> And you?
06:44 <@jhf:#liferay> yep I see it now :)
06:44 <@jhf:#liferay> welcome to our hangout!
06:44 < rrapozo:#liferay> Thanks!!! :D
06:45 < rrapozo:#liferay> Do you saw my question?
06:46 < rrapozo:#liferay> I don't know if you are a programmer! :)
06:46 < rrapozo:#liferay> Someone understand about the redirect to status.jsp? is a page to handle errors.
07:07 < modd_:#liferay> hangout?
07:08 < modd_:#liferay> rrapozo: not sure, maybe it's redirecting to the status page if non servlet filter etc will match the requested path
07:11 <@jhf:#liferay> There are also some handy links I've found via google: https://www.liferay.com/community/forums/-/message_boards/message/11279721 and http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13864162/how-to-intercept-error-request-and-redirect-to-a-custom-page I think the easiest is a JSP hook to override Liferay's built-in 404.jsp
07:11 <@jhf:#liferay> modd_: sorry - I shouldn't mix hangout with IRC room
07:11 <@jhf:#liferay> :)
07:11 < rrapozo:#liferay> modd_: Thanks for the answer. I can redirect but before redirect show for 5 seconds a page.
07:11 < modd_:#liferay> good to have you here jhf!
07:12 < modd_:#liferay> I have to do the liferay dev certification tomorrow
07:12 < modd_:#liferay> what secret information do you have? ^^
07:13 < rrapozo:#liferay> jhf: the 404 error is more easy because is just put it "layout.friendly.url.page.not.found=/html/portal/404.jsp" on :q
07:13 < rrapozo:#liferay> on portal-ext.properties
07:14 < rrapozo:#liferay> sorry vi skills :P
07:14 <@jhf:#liferay> hahahah.. good luck! the only thing I've heard is that it has a lot of specific questions related to backend development, not so much frontend. but i've not seen the test! so it might have been updated.
07:14 < rrapozo:#liferay> good luck modd_
07:15 < modd_:#liferay> so liferay staff don't have to do the liferay certification? is it a good sign or rather a bad one? ;)
07:15 < rrapozo:#liferay> So my problem is with the 403 errors (forbidden)
07:16 <@jhf:#liferay> modd_: many do, but it's not a requirement
07:16 <@jhf:#liferay> pretty sure I would fail it. I do more frontend tinkering
07:17 < modd_:#liferay> -.-
07:17 < modd_:#liferay> afaik it's pretty hard
07:18 < modd_:#liferay> would be a nice one if I fail after beeing a pulse award winner^^
07:20 < modd_:#liferay> does the plan for the unconference already exist? I think I have some slot but don't know when and in with form I have to do my presentation/whatever :\
07:47 < winem_:#liferay> hello, do you know the situation when a colleague steps in and says "I've done something stupid..."? happened a sec ago..
07:47 < winem_:#liferay> the edit controls does no longer appear on our website. does this mean that he has removed the css or something like this?
07:48 < winem_:#liferay> we can login into liferay and the edit controls disappear when I click on My Sites and choose one
07:52 < winem_:#liferay> how can I "re-enable" those control fields?
07:57 < urug_:#liferay> how to obtain asset entry title from web content structure template?
07:58 < urug_:#liferay> all structure's field references are present, but no reference to asset entry
08:03 < winem_:#liferay> anyone an idea how I can get the dock bar on the top back?
08:03 < modd_:#liferay> winem_: what did he do?
08:03 < modd_:#liferay> sonds like an js problem
08:04 < modd_:#liferay> does it happen on every page? like control panel too?
08:04 < winem_:#liferay> still waiting for his response.. his job was to fix 2 small css and maybe js issues on the website
08:04 < winem_:#liferay> no, not on the control panel
08:04 < modd_:#liferay> so only on that one page or on every page with the same theme
08:04 < modd_:#liferay> ?
08:05 < winem_:#liferay> there is only one page at the moment
08:05 < winem_:#liferay> wait, I think there should be a 2nd one... the proof of concept, let me check
