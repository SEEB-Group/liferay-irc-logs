06:36 < timmy__> hello
06:36 < timmy__> does anybody know how I could apply an asset category Id when I click on a link?
09:29 < Tar-Minyatur> Hi guys. Somebody reading here? I'm trying to find a way to change the default settings for the publishing dialog. Any ideas about that?

11:47 < jardineworks>  apucay, Naenyn or you could write a struts hook for the action. Extend the existing one, call the parent first, then apply your custom logic before forwarding on.

13:29 < Naenyn> I'm just confused what the actual list of places is that I can hook in to. It sounds like any *LocalServiceUtil can be wrapped.. but I thought there was a list of events, too.

18:22 < Naenyn> Does anyone know if it is possible to set up Liferay as a SAML client/consumer?
18:22  * Naenyn bets jhf knows!
18:22 < apucay> you can as an EE customer
18:23 < Naenyn> we are.
18:23 < apucay> there is a SAML plugin in marketplace
18:23 < Naenyn> I've seen a bit about how to make it a provider.. but we already have a provider. =]
18:23 < apucay> it can be either and IDP or SP
18:23 < Naenyn> Hm.. I will have to check it out.
20:44 < Naenyn> I hadn't realized the difference in terminology between IDP and SP. Woops. =]
