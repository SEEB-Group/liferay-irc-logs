11:47 < jardineworks>  apucay, Naenyn or you could write a struts hook for the action. Extend the existing one, call the parent first, then apply your custom logic before forwarding on.

13:29 < Naenyn> I'm just confused what the actual list of places is that I can hook in to. It sounds like any *LocalServiceUtil can be wrapped.. but I thought there was a list of events, too.
