03:13 < meld> anybody has a clue
03:13 < meld> ?
06:39 < sm`pid> hello
06:39 < sm`pid> https://www.liferay.com/community/forums/-/message_boards/message/38346751
06:39 < sm`pid> anyone has some other idea?
06:42 < sl33k> hello, if one creates multiple liferay portlets in a single portlet liferay project resulting to one war file. Are each portlets still treated as seperate mini web applications, loaded by different class loaders when deployed?
07:18 < sl33k> i need to ask some liferay questions please
10:28 < sl33k> i need help/advise on how to inject spring objects into portlets.
10:46 < jardineworks> sl33k, sounds like you just need to build SpringMVC portlets.
10:47 < jardineworks> instead of using the Liferay MVC, Generic or any other flabour.
10:47 < jardineworks> flavour*
11:30 < sl33k> jardineworks: hi
11:30 < sl33k> jardineworks: my problem with Spring MVC portlets is that it doesnt really hide the two phase liferay cycles
11:30 < sl33k> hence, not natural Spring MVC at all
11:31 < sl33k> jardineworks: is it possible to have spring create the Portlet itself, which would now allow it to inject?
11:51 < jardineworks> sl33k, to be honest I have only worked with Generic portlets and LiferayMVC portlets.
