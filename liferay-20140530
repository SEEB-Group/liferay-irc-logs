03:12 < meld> hi
03:13 < meld> i have a problem with custom field. i have created two of them attached to documents. Now i want to update them. This is only working when im doing changes within a standard field.
03:13 < meld> anybody has a clue
03:13 < meld> ?
06:39 < sm`pid> hello
06:39 < sm`pid> https://www.liferay.com/community/forums/-/message_boards/message/38346751
06:39 < sm`pid> anyone has some other idea?
06:42 < sl33k> hello, if one creates multiple liferay portlets in a single portlet liferay project resulting to one war file. Are each portlets still treated as seperate mini web applications, loaded by different class loaders when deployed?
07:18 < sl33k> i need to ask some liferay questions please
10:28 < sl33k> i need help/advise on how to inject spring objects into portlets.
10:46 < jardineworks> sl33k, sounds like you just need to build SpringMVC portlets.
10:47 < jardineworks> instead of using the Liferay MVC, Generic or any other flabour.
10:47 < jardineworks> flavour*
11:30 < sl33k> jardineworks: hi
11:30 < sl33k> jardineworks: my problem with Spring MVC portlets is that it doesnt really hide the two phase liferay cycles
11:30 < sl33k> hence, not natural Spring MVC at all
11:31 < sl33k> jardineworks: is it possible to have spring create the Portlet itself, which would now allow it to inject?
11:51 < jardineworks> sl33k, to be honest I have only worked with Generic portlets and LiferayMVC portlets.
11:53 < sl33k> i dont want to use service builders, and want to tie mine to either Spring or Java EE> My colleague has achieved the latter
11:54 < sl33k> jardineworks: is it true that if you create nested liferay portlets in a single liferay plugin project, and package as a single war. each of the portlets still get deployed as seperate web apps? hence they still arent able to share common web stuff like hibernate sessions?
12:05 < jardineworks> sl33k, both approaches work.
12:06 < sl33k> jardineworks: yeah. but i prefer to have in reality one web application with multiple portlets
12:07 < jardineworks> sl33k, I personally tried to group portlets that are similar together. For example, if you have a billing application, would you write 3 seperate web applications (WARs) to build it? or would you build one? IF you had that in place and then build an HR application, that would probably be a new WAR. So I translate that into portlets. One billing-portlet that contains mutiple portlets each representing a component of the billing
