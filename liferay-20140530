06:42 < sl33k> hello, if one creates multiple liferay portlets in a single portlet liferay project resulting to one war file. Are each portlets still treated as seperate mini web applications, loaded by different class loaders when deployed?
07:18 < sl33k> i need to ask some liferay questions please
10:28 < sl33k> i need help/advise on how to inject spring objects into portlets.
10:46 < jardineworks> sl33k, sounds like you just need to build SpringMVC portlets.
10:47 < jardineworks> instead of using the Liferay MVC, Generic or any other flabour.
