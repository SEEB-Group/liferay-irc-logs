04:34 < Axxell:#liferay> anybody?
07:39 < Axxell:#liferay> um another thing guys
07:40 < Axxell:#liferay> when using CAS, i want to have files which are public on an intranet site. What i need is not to be redirected to CAS autologin site when the file is visible for everybody... this does not happen.. it does not matter if there is a need for login or not you are redirected to CAS
08:22 < Yam`:#liferay> hello :)
09:34 < Yam`:#liferay> What's the difference between the render, doView and include methods in a portlet java class? In which one should I do my code (e.g.: retrieve data from database)?
15:34 < bijoo_:#liferay> Yam` they correspond to portlet lifecycle
15:35 < bijoo_:#liferay> Yam` think of them as HTTP GET, POST; render is like the GET, POST like action. Though encourage you to read portlet spec.
15:36 < bijoo_:#liferay> Axxell ".. tried to escape those but nope.. anybody having this problem?" not sure what you mean; what's an example?
15:40 < bijoo_:#liferay> Axxell for the CAS question, here is my take: CAS Filter is used to authenticate; I don't see any authorizations; so it depends where the resource is placed; if in a private site, then needs login; so the CAS Filter comes to work here; though if on public , it should be fine; since default lets Guest to view the resource.
19:18 < scribe:#liferay> Hey guys.  Has anyone updgraded to 6.2 and might answer some questions for me?  I'm having all kinds of issue with 6.2.  We're trying to evaluate a move from 6.1
