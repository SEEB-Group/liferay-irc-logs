01:18 < Axxell:#liferay> Hello strangers, got a another problem: Trying to get CAS to work, got it to work from a local dev server using the default tomcat port 8080.. when trying to get a productionserver to work, which uses ajp connector against apache, and is not version 6.2 as the testserver but 6.1, I get it to pass the test when pushing "test cas configuration", but when trying to login i just get an eternal loop trying to login. Any clue what could be t
02:08 < Axxell:#liferay> Anybody?
03:20 < rocknrol1_:#liferay> whats up with liferay.com. whatever page i try to access, it says "please set new password"
03:20 < rocknrol1_:#liferay> with no explanation
03:34 < Axxell:#liferay> anyone want to help with my CAS problem?
03:35 < rocknrol1_:#liferay> have you used live http headers or fiddler to investigate whats happening?
03:35 < rocknrol1_:#liferay> are cookies not getting set?
03:40 < Axxell:#liferay> trying to find out whats happening, it just begins a 302 loop
03:41 < Axxell:#liferay> going from c/portal/login to the startpage and backagain
03:41 < Axxell:#liferay> rocknrol1_: i have apache 2.2 with mod_jk in front of the liferay 6.1 install
03:42 < Axxell:#liferay> and im starting to believe that it fails there
03:42 < Axxell:#liferay> ive got it to work with a local installation of liferay 6.2
03:43 < Axxell:#liferay> using port 8080 without a apache in front
03:50 < Axxell:#liferay> rocknrol1_: the remote cas server is not logging anything when trying to login, the redirect url is nothing
04:32 < Axxell:#liferay> Not anything is giving a clue why CAS SSO is not working, it seems more like its not at all working
05:11 < rocknrol1_:#liferay> well, we dont have a CAS setup atm and my experiences are from a really really long time ago :/
05:12 < rocknrol1_:#liferay> maybe someone will come along who can help you
05:30 < Axxell:#liferay> rocknrol1_: yeah, weve been two people trying to get it to work for 4h, giving up for the moment. Maybe ill wait until i update the server to 6.2. This one is not giving any indication that cas is even running, not one error anywhere
