10:42 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Hi there. Anyone around who knows if Liferay offers any way to access admin panel portlets aside from /group/control_panel/manage/...?
10:44 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Our live system prevents access to this URL, but we have a weird situation where somebody appears to have managed to "hack" into the system.
10:44 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> So I wonder if there might be another way to execute "admin commands".
10:44 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, what about through the JSON service interface?
10:45 < jardineworks:#liferay> what specifically has happened?
10:45 < jardineworks:#liferay> like adding users?
10:46 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I'm not 100% sure. I noticed a user account I've never seen before. Any nobody knows the guy it's supposed to belong to.
10:46 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Very weird.
10:46 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Anyway...we have a bunch of custom entities with an admin portlet to manage them.
10:46 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> One of the entity tables was almost wiped.
10:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> have you guys blocked the api/json url?
10:46 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> And another one contains only 10% of the content it should be.
10:47 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> No, we haven't blocked it.
10:47 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Does Service Builder automatically generate webservices for custom entities?
10:47 < jardineworks:#liferay> not sure
10:48 < jardineworks:#liferay> but I know that the core entities have it OOTB
10:48 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Lemme check the access logs. If someone was meddling there, it should be easy to find.
10:48 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, try going to http://[server]:[port]/api/jsonws/
10:49 < jardineworks:#liferay> see if it is exposed to the outside world
10:50 < modd:#liferay> jhf: damn, I forgot my certified dev cup..
10:50 < modd:#liferay> ^^
10:51 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah I think there was some sort of miscommunication about those mugs
10:51 <@jhf:#liferay> no one told olaf or myself about them so we didn't say a word about them!
10:52 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> jardineworks: It is, I'm pretty sure about it.
10:53 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> And I'm not even 100% sure that we don't need it somewhere.
10:54 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, do a quick code scan -- just try to find base on  a */api/json*
