10:42 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Hi there. Anyone around who knows if Liferay offers any way to access admin panel portlets aside from /group/control_panel/manage/...?
10:44 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Our live system prevents access to this URL, but we have a weird situation where somebody appears to have managed to "hack" into the system.
10:44 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> So I wonder if there might be another way to execute "admin commands".
10:44 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, what about through the JSON service interface?
10:45 < jardineworks:#liferay> what specifically has happened?
10:45 < jardineworks:#liferay> like adding users?
10:46 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I'm not 100% sure. I noticed a user account I've never seen before. Any nobody knows the guy it's supposed to belong to.
10:46 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Very weird.
10:46 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Anyway...we have a bunch of custom entities with an admin portlet to manage them.
10:46 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> One of the entity tables was almost wiped.
10:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> have you guys blocked the api/json url?
10:46 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> And another one contains only 10% of the content it should be.
10:47 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> No, we haven't blocked it.
10:47 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Does Service Builder automatically generate webservices for custom entities?
10:47 < jardineworks:#liferay> not sure
10:48 < jardineworks:#liferay> but I know that the core entities have it OOTB
10:48 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Lemme check the access logs. If someone was meddling there, it should be easy to find.
10:48 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, try going to http://[server]:[port]/api/jsonws/
10:49 < jardineworks:#liferay> see if it is exposed to the outside world
10:50 < modd:#liferay> jhf: damn, I forgot my certified dev cup..
10:50 < modd:#liferay> ^^
10:51 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah I think there was some sort of miscommunication about those mugs
10:51 <@jhf:#liferay> no one told olaf or myself about them so we didn't say a word about them!
10:52 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> jardineworks: It is, I'm pretty sure about it.
10:53 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> And I'm not even 100% sure that we don't need it somewhere.
10:54 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, do a quick code scan -- just try to find base on  a */api/json*
10:54 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I would have to scan all web content templates as well...
10:55 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, true.
10:55 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Ah yeah. We have one webservice that we need in there.
10:55 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Now I remember.
10:55 < modd:#liferay> do you remember the shorturl session? would it me mean to release something like this now because I have such a portlet/hook^^
10:57 < modd_:#liferay> %$&ยง router...
10:59 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Mhm. In the access logs I can't see any requests to /api/ other than those to our webservice.
11:00 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I found some very shifty looking requests in the access logs. Stuff with "create_anonymous_account" in the url. Sure looked like somebody was trying to get in using some kind of bug/feature I don't know of.
11:02 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, have a look at the issues.liferay.com for new security tickets.
11:02 < jardineworks:#liferay> which version are you on again? 6.1?
11:17 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> 6.1.2
11:17 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I'll take a look once I've smoothed out that issue.
11:18 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Nobody noticed the values missing for some reason...and the last RDS snapshot is not old enough...that will cause quite some pain.
13:59 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> jardineworks: Btw...thanks for your advice. :)
14:02 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, no problem, it was about a year ago I think we first worked together :)
14:10 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I do believe so. ;)
14:10 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> And I haven't had IRC running in quite a while.
14:10 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Just started again some days ago.
14:10 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Probably some form of precognition or whatever. ;)
14:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> haha
14:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, did you go todev con?
14:13 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> No. We're in a hot phase of the current projects. There was no way I would be permitted to be absent.
14:14 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I haven't been working in depth with Liferay lately. We're doing more standalone stuff at the momenent.
14:15 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> And whenever I feel like it's become pleasantly quiet, Liferay stabs me in the back. -.-
14:15 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Or rather OUR Liferay.
14:43 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, haha -- and here I thought that your silence in the channel over the last few months was you reaching stability. Now I find out you just avoided the platform :)
14:57 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> It keeps chasing me.
14:58 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I've always been on IRC especially because of the easy contact with other developers.
14:58 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Sadly, I haven't really been developing anything lately.
14:58 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Except for a few small Python and PHP tools.
14:58 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> So, I became less and less active on IRC. And most of my day-to-day communication has migrated to GHang and Skype.
17:27 < miffor:#liferay> hola
17:28 < miffor:#liferay> anyone use intellij?
18:09 < gogamoga:#liferay> any wizards around?
18:43 < gogamoga:#liferay> is there any way to get original unfiltered request ? (Liferay 6.1.1)
18:43 < gogamoga:#liferay> need to check cookies of guests inside web-content
18:44 < gogamoga:#liferay> theres no access to config files and stuff so cant disable layout cache
18:45 < gogamoga:#liferay> or any other trick to disable this damn filter programatically and be able to read live cookies instead of cached shit
18:45 < gogamoga:#liferay> https://www.liferay.com/community/forums/-/message_boards/message/4045191
18:45 < gogamoga:#liferay> its mentioned here, but its ugly solution (and it does not work)
