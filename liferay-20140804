07:05 < Jadobi:#liferay> Hi, i'm fairly new to portals, but i have to figure out which portal solution we should use, to get Portlet 2.0 (and in the future 3.0) support. Right now we use an older uPortal Version 2.x but we want move to Liferay 6 or uPortal 4.
07:05 < Jadobi:#liferay> An important criteria is to integrate existing portlets and webapps form the old portal setup and also have LDAP and CAS support for SSO. I have already configured Liferay to use Jasig CAS for SSO and integrated some portlets. This was not a big problem. The bigger challenge seems to be to get the web applications(they CASified and Spring MVC based) running in Liferay. After a user logged on Liferay, it should be also logged on to the web applications
07:05 < Jadobi:#liferay> What is the best way to achieve this? IFrame or the WebProxyPortlet? Can someone give me please an advise how to do this in Liferay?
