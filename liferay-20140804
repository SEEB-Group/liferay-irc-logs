07:05 < Jadobi:#liferay> Hi, i'm fairly new to portals, but i have to figure out which portal solution we should use, to get Portlet 2.0 (and in the future 3.0) support. Right now we use an older uPortal Version 2.x but we want move to Liferay 6 or uPortal 4.
07:05 < Jadobi:#liferay> An important criteria is to integrate existing portlets and webapps form the old portal setup and also have LDAP and CAS support for SSO. I have already configured Liferay to use Jasig CAS for SSO and integrated some portlets. This was not a big problem. The bigger challenge seems to be to get the web applications(they CASified and Spring MVC based) running in Liferay. After a user logged on Liferay, it should be also logged on to the web applications
07:05 < Jadobi:#liferay> What is the best way to achieve this? IFrame or the WebProxyPortlet? Can someone give me please an advise how to do this in Liferay?
07:08 < mvlach:#liferay> hi all
07:09 < Jadobi:#liferay> hi
07:09 < mvlach:#liferay> is there any real posibility to split some portlets to other JVM ? especial in CE edition ?
07:09 < mvlach:#liferay> can I use WSRP ?
07:45 < Jadobi1:#liferay> nobody a clue?
09:39 < jardineworks:#liferay> Jadobi1, Just want to make sure I understand .. you have the user logging into Liferay but you want them to access the data from an external system. Is that right?
09:39 < jardineworks:#liferay> So basically, the portlet in Liferay becomes more just the view for data that is pulled in from elsewhere?
09:41 -!- mode/#liferay [+o jhf] by ChanServ
09:43 < Jadobi1:#liferay> @jardineworks correct
09:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> Jadobi1, and the external applications can't leverage SSO?
09:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> that is afterall the main benefit...
09:50 < jardineworks:#liferay> Jadobi1, Alternatively... how is the data in the other application accessed? via services? direct database connection?
09:50 < Jadobi1:#liferay> I can authenticate the app outside the portal via CAS, but inside the portal the user is already logged on via cas but the app can't find the ticket ... i need some sort of proxying from the portal
09:50 < Jadobi1:#liferay> Direct database connection
09:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> Jadobi1, so you have a portlet in Liferay that is connecting to the external applicaiton database -- Is it read only? or can you update records as well?
09:52 < Jadobi1:#liferay> no right now i have only the webapplication running on the same server as liferay
09:55 < jardineworks:#liferay> Jadobi1, ok -- there is a feature in Liferay called Service Builder. Using this tool you can model entities in XML and use a code generation tool to generate 80% of the Java code you need to work with them. The code generated follows the same model as the core Liferay entities ... User, Group, Org, etc. So you end up with the same deign pattern of *LocalServiceUtil. If you put your custom entities in Liferay it will even gener
09:55 < jardineworks:#liferay> ate the sql source and automagically create the tables for you when you deploy the plugin. HOWEVER, it is also possible to define a model and map it to an existing table ... basically external datasource.
09:55 < jardineworks:#liferay> If I were you I would probably do that..
09:55 < jardineworks:#liferay> Define a service builder model, specify an external datasource, and then in your portlet use the generated code to read the external database.
09:56 < jardineworks:#liferay> you could forego integration with the other application altogether ... but leave it in place if certain groups require it. But if you migrate the UI features to portlets and deploy them in Liferay, it means you could sunset the other application altogether.
10:02 < Jadobi1:#liferay> I cannot rewrite all the web applications ... basically i want to display this web applications(spring based) inside the portal and also leverage SSO ... (via IFrame or ProxyPortlet)
10:06 < Jadobi1:#liferay> In the future, these web applications are then converted into portlets gradually.
10:07 < jardineworks:#liferay> Jadobi1, This is Liferay 6.2 I assume?
10:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> Jadobi1, I've never done what you are trying to do... all my external systems integration has been what I described above, or using services that were exposed by the external application ... or, lastly, using OpenSSO. But I am happy to try to figure it out with you.
10:10 < Jadobi1:#liferay> yes Liferay 6.2 CE
10:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> Jadobi1, so I can catch up with where you are at... you have followed the Liferay cas guide already right?
10:12 < Jadobi1:#liferay> Yes Jasig CAS is running on an different tomcat locally and the portal can use it for user auth
10:12 < Jadobi1:#liferay> with SSL
