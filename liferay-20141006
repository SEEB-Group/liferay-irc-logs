02:54 < Axxell:#liferay> Anyone feel like helping? Ive got a portlet which uses servicebuilder which has date objects. When trying to save date data i get only in mssql the following error (works without flaw in mysql):11:40:46,979 ERROR [ajp-apr-8009-exec-25][JDBCExceptionReporter:82] Only dates between January 1, 1753 and December 31, 9999 are accepted.
03:06 < winem_:#liferay> we had this issue about 2 years ago and it was caused by the jTDS driver
03:07 < winem_:#liferay> unfortunately, I don't remember how we fixed that.. I guess we updated the driver...

03:46 < Axxell:#liferay> winem_: any risks with updating jtds?
03:47 < winem_:#liferay> usually not, but don't know for sure.. stopped working with MSSQL a while ago.
03:48 < winem_:#liferay> you just have to check if the driver supports your database version
03:54 < Axxell:#liferay> winem_: using the latest ms sql 2012 version, one would think that these are backwards compatible but heck do i know. the jtds driver bundled with liferay 6.2 seems to be from 2009 if im not completly wrong?
