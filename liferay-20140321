04:48 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> hi there
04:50 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> problem with a form not being populated : https://www.liferay.com/community/forums/-/message_boards/message/35932749
04:50 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> If you have any ideas, I'll take them !
05:16 < nicolas_FR_:#liferay> I have a long jsp with lots of fields, and 2 steps I want to submit info. 1st step is in the middle of the jsp, last one at the end. It's 1 big DynaValidatorForm, and 1st step is here to update some database and go back to the same jsp. Is there any traps doing so ?
05:17 < nicolas_FR_:#liferay> the 2 submits have differents actions, so I set 1st action in the form action attribute, and I generate 2nd action url in a html:link, which href I copy to the form action. Any problem with that ?
05:29 < modd_:#liferay> hi topolik, just a short question. how's the quality of the czech language file?
06:05 < nicolas_FR_:#liferay> anyone know why post data would not appear in the action form ?
06:07 < modd_:#liferay> can you explain the problem a little bit more?
06:07 < nicolas_FR_:#liferay> sure
06:07 < nicolas_FR_:#liferay> I've got 1 form.jsp page
06:08 < nicolas_FR_:#liferay> this page will be submitted 2 times. 1st submit to 1 actionA.do, 2nd submit to another actionB.do. Same DynaValidatorForm, same success page (the form.jsp).
06:10 < modd_:#liferay> submitted two times? how? why?
06:10 < nicolas_FR_:#liferay> First submit is succesfull, actionA gets the form's data and everybody is happy. I then display again the form.jsp with datas from the session form, and I continue to fill my fields. Second submit (changing form action with javascript) is a failure : I enter the action, but my form object is still with parameters from 1st submit. Nothing more.
06:11 < modd_:#liferay> well yes, it's like you submit a form and then press f5 an you'll get the same parameters, eventhough you didn't fill the form the second time
