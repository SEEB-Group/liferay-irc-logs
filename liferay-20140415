06:38 < GeoPlace-Tom> Hello, I'm having a spot of bother with some LDAP config. Originally I set it to use the username from our AD as the login name (eg flintstonef) but now it's been decided we should use the email address (eg fred.flintstone@example.org). I've changed the 'Screen Name' option in the LDAP config but of course all the old users are still showing as the short name. Does anyone know the right way to force a reimport?
11:11 < dave_k> I've got a liferay 6.2.1 instance that's running hot ... 100% CPU without any apparent workload. How can I debug what it's doing wrong?
11:12 < dave_k> or at least which plugin is responsible?
11:17 < dave_k> Trying kill -3 PID gives me a thread dump, but apparently no hint which thread is always busy...
13:18 < Naenyn> rotty3000: you alive? =]
13:19 <@rotty3000> hey yeah, just lots on my plate these days
13:19 < Naenyn> I bet.. you're a busy guy. =]
13:19 < Naenyn> rotty3000: have enough time to answer some hook questions?
13:20 <@rotty3000> I'll do my best
13:20 < Naenyn> \o/
13:21 < Naenyn> so I need to hook in to user creation such that both the standard user creation flow and a custom user creation portlet I'm writing can handle creating users in Liferay as well as creating the associated users in our external CAS-based system. I'm not sure what points I can hook in to, though. I got some general info from other users in here, but could definitely use some specifics on how to determine where I can hook in to.
13:22 < Naenyn> basically, when liferay sees a user creation request, it handles it as normal but then does some extra stuff.
13:23 < jardineworks> Naenyn, Struts hook on the create_account struts action.
13:23 < jardineworks> then you can inject calls to your external system to add the user there as well (assuming it has an external api that you can access?)
