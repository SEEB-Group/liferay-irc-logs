01:34 < jrmiah:#liferay> hi guys
01:34 < jrmiah:#liferay> I was goign to setup a cool demo of liferay for my managers, might result in needing a lot of PS and licenses
01:35 < jrmiah:#liferay> wanted to show remote portlets, eg, the ability to deploy small portlets in a container that can be accessed and rendered in liferay - do you guys have a howto on that?
01:36 < jrmiah:#liferay> is an iframe portlet the best way? hope not...
03:00 < bijoo_:#liferay> jrmiah: Liferay supports Social Gadgets and such
03:00 < bijoo_:#liferay> jrmiah: and has WSRP portlet
03:01 < bijoo_:#liferay> jrmiah: OpenSocial Gadgets*
03:01 < jrmiah:#liferay> yeah wsrp might be what i want
03:01 < jrmiah:#liferay> is there a howto
03:02 < bijoo_:#liferay> jrmiah: https://www.liferay.com/documentation/liferay-portal/6.2/user-guide/-/ai/using-web-services-for-remote-portlets-wsr-1
03:02 < jrmiah:#liferay> how rough is that to setup
03:02 < jrmiah:#liferay> ya think
03:02 < jrmiah:#liferay> is the remote portlet 'in a portal' need its own liferay?
03:02 < bijoo_:#liferay> jrmiah: https://t.seebgroup.com/wsrp-how-to-liferay :)
03:03 < bijoo_:#liferay> jrmiah: needs WSRP provider
03:03 < jrmiah:#liferay> 'let me google that for yo'
03:03 < jrmiah:#liferay> really man?
03:03 < bijoo_:#liferay> :)
03:03 < jrmiah:#liferay> I used to work at plumtree, is it my fault they dont have a real remote technology in liferay? heh
03:04 < jrmiah:#liferay> in plumtree portal you can write a _reall_ simple remoted portlet in a simple 'hello world' JSP and its put in a portlet pane
03:04 < bijoo_:#liferay> jrmiah: wow, plumtree / aqualogic / xyz / webcenter?
03:04 < jrmiah:#liferay> does that exist in liferay? basically it fetches the remote content and displays it
03:04 < jrmiah:#liferay> yes same stuff
03:04 < jrmiah:#liferay> kind of anyway
03:04 < jrmiah:#liferay> plumtree was better than all portals thats why it was the only standalone company that made one
03:05 < jrmiah:#liferay> and I guess liferay but Im not impressed... do me a favor, sync down the liferay source and build it
03:05 < jrmiah:#liferay> let me know when youve done it
03:05 < jrmiah:#liferay> should only be 5 mionutes right
03:05 < bijoo_:#liferay> jrmiah: only 5 mins if running SSDs
03:06 < jrmiah:#liferay> bijoo: ok let me clarify - take a clean linux system and pull down the source and build it
03:06 < jrmiah:#liferay> as a release / build / tools manager thats not acceptable
03:06 < jrmiah:#liferay> heh
03:06 < bijoo_:#liferay> jrmiah: actually don't need to build from source
03:07 < bijoo_:#liferay> jrmiah: has robust plugins so no need for that
03:07 < jrmiah:#liferay> bijoo: thats not what i said; I asked to build from source :)
03:07 < jrmiah:#liferay> I can give you a 'let me google that for you' link if you want
03:07 < jrmiah:#liferay> it doesnt work
03:07 < jrmiah:#liferay> thats not a sign of solid engineering
03:07 < bijoo_:#liferay> jrmiah: then do you want to build OS from source? "as a release / build / tools manager thats not acceptable" :)
03:08 < jrmiah:#liferay> yes I run gentoo
03:09 < bijoo_:#liferay> jrmiah: I've used various Oracle portals (I've lost count, are there 9 by now or more?) Never looked back after seeing Liferay.
03:10 < jrmiah:#liferay> i dont work there any more heh havent for 5 years
03:10 < jrmiah:#liferay> and yeah liferay is 'free'
03:10 < jrmiah:#liferay> think that has something to do with it, not abilities of product
03:10 < jrmiah:#liferay> but i digress
03:11 < jrmiah:#liferay> in some portals i can just configrue a remote portlet that 'scrapes' an app - is that not a feature? WSRP isnt a real soltion... maybe iwth pluto
03:12 < bijoo_:#liferay> jrmiah: :
03:12 < bijoo_:#liferay> jrmiah: :)
03:31 < jrmiah:#liferay> its ok just have an arch in my head for a demo and it wont work
03:31 < jrmiah:#liferay> so have to find alternative
03:31 < jrmiah:#liferay> wsrp could work .. with a lot of work
03:31 < jrmiah:#liferay> unnecessary
03:34 < bijoo_:#liferay> jrmiah: writing a scraper may be quite easy; depends on what target app behaves like. Have you looked at HtmlUnit?
03:34 < jrmiah:#liferay> yeahp have written a youtube video downloader with it ;)
03:34 < jrmiah:#liferay> that turns a playlist into a podcast. congratulate me later. hah
03:35 < bijoo_:#liferay> jrmiah: nice; I used it with Goose for exttraction.
03:36 < bijoo_:#liferay> jrmiah: added portlet to Liferay Marketplace; should be out after the QA process (currently pending the MP review)
