01:34 < jrmiah:#liferay> hi guys
01:34 < jrmiah:#liferay> I was goign to setup a cool demo of liferay for my managers, might result in needing a lot of PS and licenses
01:35 < jrmiah:#liferay> wanted to show remote portlets, eg, the ability to deploy small portlets in a container that can be accessed and rendered in liferay - do you guys have a howto on that?
01:36 < jrmiah:#liferay> is an iframe portlet the best way? hope not...
03:00 < bijoo_:#liferay> jrmiah: Liferay supports Social Gadgets and such
03:00 < bijoo_:#liferay> jrmiah: and has WSRP portlet
03:01 < bijoo_:#liferay> jrmiah: OpenSocial Gadgets*
03:01 < jrmiah:#liferay> yeah wsrp might be what i want
03:01 < jrmiah:#liferay> is there a howto
03:02 < bijoo_:#liferay> jrmiah: https://www.liferay.com/documentation/liferay-portal/6.2/user-guide/-/ai/using-web-services-for-remote-portlets-wsr-1
03:02 < jrmiah:#liferay> how rough is that to setup
03:02 < jrmiah:#liferay> ya think
03:02 < jrmiah:#liferay> is the remote portlet 'in a portal' need its own liferay?
03:02 < bijoo_:#liferay> jrmiah: https://t.seebgroup.com/wsrp-how-to-liferay :)
03:03 < bijoo_:#liferay> jrmiah: needs WSRP provider
03:03 < jrmiah:#liferay> 'let me google that for yo'
03:03 < jrmiah:#liferay> really man?
03:03 < bijoo_:#liferay> :)
03:03 < jrmiah:#liferay> I used to work at plumtree, is it my fault they dont have a real remote technology in liferay? heh
03:04 < jrmiah:#liferay> in plumtree portal you can write a _reall_ simple remoted portlet in a simple 'hello world' JSP and its put in a portlet pane
03:04 < bijoo_:#liferay> jrmiah: wow, plumtree / aqualogic / xyz / webcenter?
03:04 < jrmiah:#liferay> does that exist in liferay? basically it fetches the remote content and displays it
03:04 < jrmiah:#liferay> yes same stuff
03:04 < jrmiah:#liferay> kind of anyway
03:04 < jrmiah:#liferay> plumtree was better than all portals thats why it was the only standalone company that made one
03:05 < jrmiah:#liferay> and I guess liferay but Im not impressed... do me a favor, sync down the liferay source and build it
03:05 < jrmiah:#liferay> let me know when youve done it
03:05 < jrmiah:#liferay> should only be 5 mionutes right
03:05 < bijoo_:#liferay> jrmiah: only 5 mins if running SSDs
03:06 < jrmiah:#liferay> bijoo: ok let me clarify - take a clean linux system and pull down the source and build it
03:06 < jrmiah:#liferay> as a release / build / tools manager thats not acceptable
03:06 < jrmiah:#liferay> heh
03:06 < bijoo_:#liferay> jrmiah: actually don't need to build from source
