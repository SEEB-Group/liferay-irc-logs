04:25 < avinashrbhat:#liferay> hi, anyone know how to show custom roles in the porlet permission configuration. I've been able to bring the custom permissions using https://www.liferay.com/documentation/liferay-portal/6.0/development/-/ai/security-and-permissions, but i'm not being able to do the same for roles. any idea?
06:38 < balakrishna:#liferay> hi all..can anyone help me in displaying the collection object in table format using alloy UI
06:39 < balakrishna:#liferay> give the best sites for alloy UI example
08:08 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Wow. I just activated SQL logging.
08:08 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> The amount of queries issued by Liferay is staggering...
10:24 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Has one of you ever tried to use log4jdbc with Liferay?
10:24 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I need to take a look at the SQL query timings and extract a few statements for performance testing.
10:25 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> But apparently Liferay does some connection pool voodoo, which makes using log4jdbc impossible. :-/
11:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, I wonder if turning debug level on for the Hibernate targets would revel something for you?
11:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> i know its not exactly what you are looking for... but it might provide some insight
11:12 < jardineworks:#liferay> are you looking for a specific one? or do you suspect some are taking too long and you want to identify them?
11:33 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> We have performance issues in general.
11:33 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Everything that hasn't been coded by us is extremely slow.
11:33 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> And according to cloud watch neither CPU load, nor memory usage are responsible.
11:33 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> The database also doesn't show a lot of strain.
11:34 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> So I assume that either network connections are too slow, the database responds slowly despite low load (for whatever reason) or Liferay default functions are just fucking slow. ;)
11:35 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> And we want to execture some queries manually from the box to check the response time.
11:41 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> execture? Oo execute
12:13 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> It's soooo slooooow.
13:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey jhf got a second for a question?
