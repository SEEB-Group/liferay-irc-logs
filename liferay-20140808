09:52 < dawn:#liferay> hi bijoo, u there
10:08 < bijoo_:#liferay> dawn: so sorry, was completely bogged last night.
10:17 < dawn:#liferay> bijoo_: no worries..let me know if you find any solution
10:27 < npskirk:#liferay> hey, question about 6.2 CEâ€¦.
10:28 < npskirk:#liferay> My understanding is you shifted over to using Twitter bootstrap for the front end, themes, etc
10:29 < npskirk:#liferay> does this mean the YUI client and AlloyUI is gone from all the existing portlets?
11:49 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey bijoo have you built any portlet struts action hooks using 6.2 + Maven?
11:52 < jardineworks:#liferay> anyone else in here also?
11:53 < jardineworks:#liferay> for some reason, I can't seem to get my struts portlet action to override.
11:53 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik, any chance you can make my friday? lol
12:38 < jardineworks:#liferay> https://www.liferay.com/community/forums/-/message_boards/message/41191499 in case anyone can help
12:49 < jardineworks:#liferay> nevermind... I had the wrong struts mapping.
15:32 < bijoo_:#liferay> jardineworks: :) glad you got struts action to work; shouldn't matter to do with the maven; so long as the WAR file's package proper.
15:40 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo_, yeah i know -- I was grasping :). I just don't like Maven so I am always looking for a reason to give it a black eye ;)
