04:18 < modd_:#liferay> oh, olafk is online. nice to see you
04:34 < olafk:#liferay> buon giorno, modd_
04:35 < modd_:#liferay> Guten Morgen is easier ;)
04:40 < winem_:#liferay> not as easy as Moin :)
05:03 < Axxell:#liferay> hey guys still trying to get my search functionality to work in my vaadin portlet
05:03 < Axxell:#liferay> no luck..
05:20 < Axxell:#liferay> my data is indexed in lucene, but i cant get the searchportlet to display items in that index
05:58 < olafk:#liferay> Axxell - I've not done it yet other than with Assets. Search Portlet must find some way to display the results and it seems legit to ask for your content to implement the Asset Framework (this is just a guess)
05:59 < olafk:#liferay> You might get along with less than full asset support - but as I said, I've not done it yet
06:00 < Axxell:#liferay> i guess a lot of my problems comes from using a vaadin portlet
06:00 < olafk:#liferay> winem_ modd_ Moin!
06:01 < modd_:#liferay> to show an asset you need this tag and implementation in your liferay-portlet.xml: asset-renderer-factory
06:02 < modd_:#liferay> so you will have an EntityAssetRenderer and an EntityAssetRendererFactory
06:02 < modd_:#liferay> and a content.jsp which will display your asset
06:04 < olafk:#liferay> Nope, Vaadin is only the front end  - nothing to do with indexed content. It might be easier to create a single jsp to just display one piece of content (e.g. your asset) than to bring up a vaadin application for a single search result
06:05 < modd_:#liferay> ah ok, sry
06:06 < olafk:#liferay> I love to point to xmlportletfactory: The entities it creates are fully integrated into the asset framework (or can be made so). The portlets, however, are Liferay MVC, so you need to translate the concepts to Vaadin
06:06 < olafk:#liferay> modd_ "Nope" was directed to Axxell when he stated the guess about the origin of problems, not to you
06:07 < modd_:#liferay> ^^
06:08 < Axxell:#liferay> olafk: yup but the indexer wants a document to have an action url to view the document which is meant to point to a jsp file
06:09 < olafk:#liferay> Axxell: As a search result display page, do you need an interactive application? Or can you create a jsp file that brings up the Vaadin application if you actually need it?
