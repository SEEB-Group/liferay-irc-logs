04:18 < modd_:#liferay> oh, olafk is online. nice to see you
04:34 < olafk:#liferay> buon giorno, modd_
04:35 < modd_:#liferay> Guten Morgen is easier ;)
04:40 < winem_:#liferay> not as easy as Moin :)
05:03 < Axxell:#liferay> hey guys still trying to get my search functionality to work in my vaadin portlet
05:03 < Axxell:#liferay> no luck..
05:20 < Axxell:#liferay> my data is indexed in lucene, but i cant get the searchportlet to display items in that index
05:58 < olafk:#liferay> Axxell - I've not done it yet other than with Assets. Search Portlet must find some way to display the results and it seems legit to ask for your content to implement the Asset Framework (this is just a guess)
05:59 < olafk:#liferay> You might get along with less than full asset support - but as I said, I've not done it yet
06:00 < Axxell:#liferay> i guess a lot of my problems comes from using a vaadin portlet
06:00 < olafk:#liferay> winem_ modd_ Moin!
06:01 < modd_:#liferay> to show an asset you need this tag and implementation in your liferay-portlet.xml: asset-renderer-factory
06:02 < modd_:#liferay> so you will have an EntityAssetRenderer and an EntityAssetRendererFactory
06:02 < modd_:#liferay> and a content.jsp which will display your asset
06:04 < olafk:#liferay> Nope, Vaadin is only the front end  - nothing to do with indexed content. It might be easier to create a single jsp to just display one piece of content (e.g. your asset) than to bring up a vaadin application for a single search result
06:05 < modd_:#liferay> ah ok, sry
06:06 < olafk:#liferay> I love to point to xmlportletfactory: The entities it creates are fully integrated into the asset framework (or can be made so). The portlets, however, are Liferay MVC, so you need to translate the concepts to Vaadin
06:06 < olafk:#liferay> modd_ "Nope" was directed to Axxell when he stated the guess about the origin of problems, not to you
06:07 < modd_:#liferay> ^^
06:08 < Axxell:#liferay> olafk: yup but the indexer wants a document to have an action url to view the document which is meant to point to a jsp file
06:09 < olafk:#liferay> Axxell: As a search result display page, do you need an interactive application? Or can you create a jsp file that brings up the Vaadin application if you actually need it?
06:10 < Axxell:#liferay> actually dont need a display page, just show the indexed data
06:15 < Axxell:#liferay> but this far ive been unable to make the searchportlet to show that data, the index has been checked that it does contain the data, but im investigating a bug
06:15 < Axxell:#liferay> that might explain
06:15 < Axxell:#liferay> what the problem is
06:31 < olafk:#liferay> Oh yeah. A bug. That might be a problem ;) (sorry, couldn't resist)
07:15 < Axxell:#liferay> mmmyah olafk: it was me not saving companyid and groupid correctly for the assets
07:15 < Axxell:#liferay> now though an intresting new thing: the searchresult is display in the "left" column in the search result portlet
07:58 < Axxell:#liferay> now if anybody can say why the searchportlet would output the found data in the wrong column, please feel free to share
08:10 < Axxell:#liferay> the problem seemst to be in the indexer where dogetsummare wants an portleturl to be something, it doesnt like me :)
08:30 < Axxell:#liferay> dont know how to create a working porleturl for a vaadinportlet thou
08:31 < jardineworks_:#liferay> Axxell, I don't know anything about Vaadin portlets so I can't help --- what is the difference or benefit of Vaadin portlets over MVC?
08:38 < Axxell:#liferay> well mostly i just have a personal preference to use it, feels cleaner
08:38 < Axxell:#liferay> but in times like these i wish i would have just done a MVC portlet
08:50 < Axxell:#liferay> mostly the thing is that you develop vaadin aps as if it was any java app, read more here https://vaadin.com/book/-/page/preface.html
08:52 < jardineworks_:#liferay> Axxell, cool -- I;ll check it out, thanks!
09:14 < winem_:#liferay> hi, I have a problem... developers who crashed my liferay server. the last remaining issue is the following: the section of the page remains white when I login, choose the instance and go to the site pages administration and click on the first page under public pages
09:15 < winem_:#liferay> I get the expected screen when I klick on the 2nd page under public pages.
09:15 < jardineworks_:#liferay> winem_, Anything in the runtime log? Exceptions being thrown for example?
09:15 < winem_:#liferay> the section also remains white when we click on public pages and Import, e.g.
09:15 < winem_:#liferay> no, no exceptions
09:16 < winem_:#liferay> let me check the http responses.. something I forgot.
09:17 < winem_:#liferay> and I get a 200 OK if I choose the "crappy" page
09:18 < winem_:#liferay> is it worth it to start debugging? they initially crashed the service with one of the 3 options mentioned in this post: http://www.liferay.com/community/forums/-/message_boards/message/33763988
09:18 < winem_:#liferay> but then they were able to copy the page that they created yesterday and it seemed to be fixed for the moment. until they tried to access the original page
09:19 < winem_:#liferay> I can also reset the whole liferay setup (remove the portal-wizard props and cleanup the DB) if debugging would take to look
09:19 < winem_:#liferay> it's just a development server..
09:20 < jardineworks_:#liferay> winem_, quick cleanup is probably best option if it is gating progress, but it would be good to determine what caused it so that you don;t do it again right?
09:21 < jardineworks_:#liferay> are you using just the regular login? like email and password stored in LR?
09:21 < winem_:#liferay> right, this is why I ask if you have any idea.. just in case if this happens on the prod env
09:21 < winem_:#liferay> yes, regular login
09:21 < jardineworks_:#liferay> hmm
09:21 < jardineworks_:#liferay> and did you change the guest mapping to something else?
09:22 < winem_:#liferay> you might know the answers, if you ask a team of developers "what did you do before it crashed?"... so I can't exactly say what they did
09:22 < jardineworks_:#liferay> :S
09:22 < winem_:#liferay> one of them says that he thinks that he did it.. but he does not know the new value..
09:22 < jardineworks_:#liferay> lol
09:23 < winem_:#liferay> what about the database? is it admin friendly and worth to take a look at it? or would you simply recommend to reset it?
09:23 < jardineworks_:#liferay> winem_, you might be able to determine the new mapping name by looking at the Group_ table in the dv
09:23 < jardineworks_:#liferay> db
09:24 < jardineworks_:#liferay> it would be the friendlyURL for the name with a value of Guest (I think)
09:24 < jardineworks_:#liferay> usually I pay attention when I make these sorta changes :)
09:25 < winem_:#liferay> usually I would expect this from a dev, too :)
09:25 < winem_:#liferay> ok, I will dive into the database...
09:26 < jardineworks_:#liferay> winem_, Sites (on the front end) map to Groups (not UserGroups, just Groups) in the database and API
09:27 < jardineworks_:#liferay> so any changes you make to site settings will be saved to the Group_ table or something related to it probably.
09:27 < winem_:#liferay> nice, thanks for the hint
09:31 < winem_:#liferay> ok, found 19 friendly urls. only guest, test,  5 template_xxx and another one left if I reduce the list by urls matching the users mail adresses

13:10 < modd:#liferay> hey jhf
13:10 <@jhf:#liferay> yo modd
13:11 < modd:#liferay> as a community member I'd like to make you aware of a ticket I've found today
13:11 < modd:#liferay> https://issues.liferay.com/browse/LPS-28107
13:11 < modd:#liferay> it's not about the issue but the last comment :\
13:13 <@jhf:#liferay> can you reproduce it on 6.2 CE GA2?
13:13 < modd:#liferay> it's not about the content
13:13 < modd:#liferay> if you compare the creation date with the date of the first comments, it's like a punch in the face, that the supports demands 10 days for response :\
13:15 <@jhf:#liferay> how long do you think Aniceto should have waited for a response?
13:16 < modd:#liferay> at least one month after such a time
13:16 <@jhf:#liferay> I believe he tried it himself and could not reproduce it on 6.2 (the ticket was filed against 6.1 a year ago)
13:16 < modd:#liferay> I'n pretty sure he tried to reproduce and I see that it's good to close tickets
13:17 < modd:#liferay> but these 10 days in this case are pretty rude IMO
13:17 <@jhf:#liferay> ok, that's a reasonable time period, we can bump it up to 1 month in the next Community Verifier round
13:17 <@jhf:#liferay> also, note Aniceto isn't part of "paid liferay support staff" :)
13:18 <@jhf:#liferay> he was participating in the Community Verifier program during the 6.2 beta period, to help clean up old bugs that have been fixed
13:18 < modd:#liferay> well, I don't complain about the wohle support but just this one case ;)
13:18 < modd:#liferay> whole*
13:21 < modd:#liferay> the response ot the dev network is really good though
13:21 < modd:#liferay> of*
13:21 <@jhf:#liferay> hahaha
13:21 < modd:#liferay> how many people do have access to it?
13:21 <@jhf:#liferay> I see .. ok, we'll bump it up to 1 month.
13:22 <@jhf:#liferay> re: dev network - I think it's open to all yet but we haven't made any announcement because we're still working on it :) plan is to announce it on October 6
13:22 <@jhf:#liferay> (as part of the upcoming North America Symposium and then later on DevCon)
13:22 <@jhf:#liferay> actually no
13:22 <@jhf:#liferay> I take that back - it's not open to all (yet)
13:22 <@jhf:#liferay> but the oct 6 is the pan
13:22 < modd:#liferay> yep
13:22 <@jhf:#liferay> plan
13:22 <@jhf:#liferay> probably about 20 people have access to it
13:23 < modd:#liferay> I'm even getting an authentication popup before even rendering the page ;)
13:23 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah.. I'm in LA this week and forgot I'm on the LR internal network
13:23 <@jhf:#liferay> so I get no auth popups :)
13:23 < modd:#liferay> so i'm one of Liferays "special" people, ok^^
13:25 < modd:#liferay> I'll have to do the liferay certification for prof devs. any tips or learning material? ;)
13:29 < jardineworks_:#liferay> hey -- I'd be interested in any tips too... I am also in need of those certs
13:30 < modd:#liferay> AFAIK it's pretty hard, even if you're working with liferay for years
13:36 < jardineworks_:#liferay> modd, really?
13:36 < jardineworks_:#liferay> that sucks lol
13:37 < jardineworks_:#liferay> I thought that there was some kind of rule that these things are supposed to be easy to moderately difficult in nature -- because it's good to have people holding certifications with your product! :)
13:38 < modd:#liferay> it's like multiple choice with 0-4 number of correct answers. and you have questions that are so specific, that you should learn DTDs by heart :\
13:39 < jardineworks_:#liferay> the sample ones didn't see too bad. But I suppose that there were only 2 or 3 of them
14:29 -!- mode/#liferay [+o _jhf_] by ChanServ
15:36 < stefkos:#liferay> lo
15:37 < stefkos:#liferay> I know its question more about maven but...
15:38 < stefkos:#liferay> I have maven project of Liferay portlet and inside MyPortlet.java created by me
15:39 < stefkos:#liferay> inside portlet.xml there was <portlet-class> javax.portlet.faces.GenericFacesPortlet
15:39 < stefkos:#liferay> now I changed that to my Portlet java class ..but liferay is screaming that he cannot find my class when I launch app
15:40 < stefkos:#liferay> how to add my class to app?
15:40 < jardineworks_:#liferay> stefkos, is MyPortlet.java inheritting the GenericFacesPortlet?
15:40 < stefkos:#liferay> yep
15:40 < jardineworks_:#liferay> stefkos, can you share your full portlet.xml?
15:40 < jardineworks_:#liferay> and your pom.xml?
15:40 < stefkos:#liferay> sure
15:42 < stefkos:#liferay> I'm newbee here
15:42 < stefkos:#liferay> http://pastebin.com/pYFjmjP5
15:42 < stefkos:#liferay> just checked and  ... class FileAdminPortlet extends MVCPortlet {}
15:42 < stefkos:#liferay> nothing more
15:43 < jardineworks_:#liferay> one sec
15:43 < stefkos:#liferay> ok
15:43 < stefkos:#liferay> its nice that you are helping me
15:43 < jardineworks_:#liferay> karma :)
15:43 < stefkos:#liferay> :)
15:44 < jardineworks_:#liferay> and I recently started using maven with Liferay so I know your pain. I hate it.
15:44 < stefkos:#liferay> guys just bring a lot of shit
15:44 < stefkos:#liferay> someday someone must make something really good
15:44 < jardineworks_:#liferay> stefkos, when you created the project, did you create an MVC Portlet or a JSF Portlet?
15:45 < stefkos:#liferay> nope:(
15:45 < stefkos:#liferay> I had empty source directory
15:45 < jardineworks_:#liferay> no no I mean those are the options (including Vaadin) ..
15:45 < jardineworks_:#liferay> that choice you make just sets the portlet-class in the portlet.xml
15:45 < stefkos:#liferay> As I remember Ive done that later
15:45 < jardineworks_:#liferay> you chose JSF?
15:45 < stefkos:#liferay> and created portlet with generic class
15:46 < stefkos:#liferay> and jsf->primve faces
15:46 < jardineworks_:#liferay> ok -- but you said the FileAdminPortlet is extending MVCPortlet right now?
15:46 < stefkos:#liferay> yeah, just to check
15:46 < stefkos:#liferay> but I have Nullpointer exception
15:46 < jardineworks_:#liferay> if it is, then change it to GenericFacesPortlet
15:46 < stefkos:#liferay> that liferay cannot find this class
15:47 < stefkos:#liferay> SEVERE: Servlet.service() for servlet jsp threw exception
15:47 < stefkos:#liferay> java.lang.NullPointerException
15:47 < stefkos:#liferay> 	at com.liferay.portlet.PortletContextFactory._create(PortletContextFactory.java:84)
15:47 < jardineworks_:#liferay> after you change it?
15:47 < stefkos:#liferay> even after change
15:48 < stefkos:#liferay> will restart server now to be sure
15:48 < jardineworks_:#liferay> right click on the project name and choose Run > Maven > Clean
15:48 < jardineworks_:#liferay> then do the Liferay > Maven > liferay:deploy
15:48 < stefkos:#liferay> ok
15:49 < stefkos:#liferay> downloading...building
15:50 < stefkos:#liferay> nice hints btw:)
15:51 < jardineworks_:#liferay> that's my favourite part... maven stuff is all over the map
15:51 < jardineworks_:#liferay> I am still trying to figure out how to get JRebel to work with it.
15:51 < stefkos:#liferay> yeah
15:52 < jardineworks_:#liferay> I can't get mine to auto compile a class when I make a change so JRebel never picks it up. I had forgotten how much slower development was without JRebel
15:52 < stefkos:#liferay> hehe
15:53 < stefkos:#liferay> fck
15:53 < stefkos:#liferay> maven cannot find my jre...wtf
15:55 < jardineworks_:#liferay> stefkos, right click on the project and check your build path
15:55 < stefkos:#liferay> well I have now
15:55 < stefkos:#liferay>  tools.jar not found: C:\Java\jre7\..\lib\tools.jar -> [Help 1]
15:56 < jardineworks_:#liferay> is it there?
15:56 < jardineworks_:#liferay> :)
15:57 < jardineworks_:#liferay> I had this problem once I remember and in the end I found that I had an environment variable set incorrectly
15:57 < stefkos:#liferay> probably same thing
15:57 < stefkos:#liferay> hmm
15:57 < stefkos:#liferay> JAVA_HOME is set to jdk
15:57 < stefkos:#liferay> directory
15:58 < jardineworks_:#liferay> that path above is for a jre though, not a jdk
15:58 < stefkos:#liferay> then it should be set to
