07:13 < modd_> I'm look for some overview page of LR and JSRs. especially I'm looking for JSR 333
07:14 < modd_> or at least jsr 283
08:36 < jardineworks> modd_, https://www.liferay.com/products/liferay-portal/tech-specs -- do a find in the page for "Standards"
08:37 < modd_> i know this page. jsr170 is listed, but the rest not
08:37 < modd_> a list of compatible browsers is also missing on this page
08:38 < jardineworks> good point
08:38 < jardineworks> modd_, sorry, so you just want to know whether or not Liferay is compliant with 333 and 283?
08:39 < modd_> yep
