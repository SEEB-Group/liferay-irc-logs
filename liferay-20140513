11:43 < bijoo_> People overlook when all's going well; but when find bug, sometimes overreact.
12:03 < daq> Hi! I was wondering in which timezone are the majority of people in this channel located at?
12:08  * bijoo_ thinks-5>most people>-8
12:08  * bijoo_ is UTC-5
12:20 < daq> cool, thanks!
12:32 < timmy__> hello
12:32 < Guest37707> does anyone know if application adapters work for all JSP’s, or only for portlet JSP’s?
12:34 < timmy___> does anyone know if application adapters work for all JSP’s, or only for portlet JSP’s?
12:34 < timmy___> @rotty3000 do you know this?
12:47 < timmy___> jhf: do you know anything about these application adapters?
12:48 <@jhf> dunno that one - all I know is app adapters were designed for Social Office. lemme see if I can find some docs.
12:49 <@jhf> so real quick read of https://www.liferay.com/community/wiki/-/wiki/Main/Application+Adapters tells me that it should work for all JSPs
12:49 <@jhf> still looking
12:50 <@jhf> ahh official docs! https://www.liferay.com/documentation/liferay-portal/6.1/development/-/ai/lp-6-1-dgen06-customizing-sites-and-site-templates-with-application-adapt-0
12:52 <@jhf> so are you trying to override a JSP in a custom portlet? i.e. some jsp that is NOT under webapps/ROOT/html ?
13:00 < timmy___> no, it works perfectly for JSP’s of Liferay portlets
13:00 < timmy___> but not for taglibs for example
13:00 < timmy___> or common html files
13:03 < timmy___> Liferay taglib jsps cann’t be customized by application adapter?
13:04 < timmy___> only the ones in /html/portlet
13:08 < modd> taglibs can be hooked, too
13:08 < modd> everything in /html
13:09 < timmy___> @modd: yes, but also for 1 specific site with application adapters?
13:10 < modd> not if you're not willing to add a complexe site checking into your hook^^
13:10 < modd> changing tags will always affect every usage of that tag
14:33 < daq> Hi, when displaying content using a "Display Page", the page title ends up as: <Content Title>+<Display Page Title>. Do you know which is the best way of modifying this behavior?
16:00 < bijoo_> daq: what version of portal are you using?
16:07 < Naenyn> bijoo_: Would you happen to know if I can add a custom authenticator and still use the cas autologin? I need to do one check to compare the user's liferay account with the user's external account..
16:07 < Naenyn> guess that question is open to anyone =]
16:16 < daq> hey guys, do you know where to get a listing of users subscribed to the blog? (LR 6.1) Tks
16:30 < daq> Liferay 6.1.20
16:46 < daq> bijoo_: Liferay 6.1.20
17:35 < Naenyn> Is it possible to tell if the user is logging in via the out-of-the-box login portlet or via whatever /c/portal/login is wired up to use?
18:23 < Naenyn> ah.. moot point, autologin skips the authenticator anyway...
20:01 < bijoo_> Naenyn: seems you answered your own question here :)
