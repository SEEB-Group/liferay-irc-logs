05:44 < goku_:#liferay> Hi am trying to load the liferay setup public page inside another iframe in another setup ..but it shows error Load denied by X-Frame-Options: http://<my liferay page link> does not permit cross-origin framing
05:44 < goku_:#liferay> how to resolve this issue
05:44 < goku_:#liferay> ?
05:50 < modd_:#liferay> this is browser related
05:55 < goku_:#liferay> modd_:so for showing the public pages of liferay in a iframe what to do?
05:56 < modd_:#liferay> well, in most browsers you can change the settings
05:57 < modd_:#liferay> however, it's a bad idea, as it's a security issue

13:32 < jardineworks_:#liferay> has anyone here started using arquillian yet?
13:45 < modd:#liferay> nope, but I really would like to try it...I need days with like 50h
15:18 < jardineworks_:#liferay> boo
15:19 < jardineworks_:#liferay> my biggest issue right now is trying to figure out how the hell to get it to work with Maven! I have all of it working except one thing. I am missing whichever jar contains the WebArchiveBuilder class(es) and I am worreid that it is only available for ANT right now,
15:20 < jardineworks_:#liferay> and I tried to build the modules/sdk/ant-arquillian from the liferay-portal git source and I am getting an error about a missing file :(
15:56 < jardineworks_:#liferay> csierra1: \o/! tienes una minuto para una question?
