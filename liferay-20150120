06:19 < goku_:#liferay> hi while getting the portlet title using the api themeDisplay.getPortletDisplay().getTitle() am able to get the old title(i edited the title)..how to get the latest title ?
08:09 < modd_:#liferay> hi guys. anyone knows how to get the webcontent Id of the current webcontent in a webcontent template?
09:21 < bijoo_:#liferay> goku_: I don't think it would be a cache issue; since theme display is made on each request; so I'd double check if it's really changed: liferay-portlet.xml, portlet.xml, and check liferay-display.com for good measure.
09:21 < bijoo_:#liferay> goku_: in the control panel in the list of portlets
09:21 < bijoo_:#liferay> also check if it's reflected in list
09:24 < bijoo_:#liferay> modd_: you're not alone in the template dark land; https://gist.github.com/bmvakili/5051f9c51469a1a7464c
09:24 < bijoo_:#liferay> modd_: those are for the web content vars you get
09:24 < modd_:#liferay> in freemarker you have to use .var[...] additionally. that was my problem
09:25 < bijoo_:#liferay> modd_: https://gist.github.com/bmvakili/ae0f057a68ac732ad138
09:25 < bijoo_:#liferay> modd_: latter are for kaleo template variables
09:26 < bijoo_:#liferay> modd_: I usually can get away with ${variableName} unless the variable has special characters
09:27 < bijoo_:#liferay> modd_: in that case there are some tricks as you said : http://freemarker.org/docs/app_faq.html#faq_strange_variable_name
09:28 < modd_:#liferay> I don't use any custom vars so no problem here
09:29 < bijoo_:#liferay> modd_: One freemarker shortcoming's quite irksome: cannot pass "null" when calling bean methods; freemarker doesn't support it (or wants). So calling lots of LR methods fails : http://freemarker.org/docs/app_faq.html#faq_null
09:29 < bijoo_:#liferay> modd_: I even asked Liferay remove one case: https://issues.liferay.com/browse/LPS-51567 but many more remain with no resolve
