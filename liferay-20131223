10:40 <@jhf:#liferay> hey mordonez
11:31 <@jhf:#liferay> ya know rotty3000 when I was @ sun I was always impressed with the snappiness of the windows desktop experience. the mouse movement was very smooth vs. Solaris' jerky feel. but even with "inferior" old sun boxes, they always ran non-gui apps (like compilers and other compute-intensive jobs) much faster than windows.
11:31 <@jhf:#liferay> so I think that windows and macs sacrifice raw compute for sexy GUIs
11:31 <@jhf:#liferay> and they also suck. thoughts?
12:21 < Slagwag:#liferay> yea
15:26 <@jhf:#liferay> jabakbakker: is that *the* jack bakker ?
