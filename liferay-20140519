01:36 < rocknroll_> hey all. I made a mistake early on and made my pages public. Now I need to make them so that they all need signing in
01:37 < rocknroll_> It seems pretty difficult
01:39 < rocknroll_> and the permissions are a mess..
01:50 < modd_> go to the sites config
01:50 < modd_> click on one of the pages
01:50 < modd_> click on permissions
01:50 < modd_> and take away guest permissions
