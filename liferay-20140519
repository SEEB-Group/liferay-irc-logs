01:36 < rocknroll_> hey all. I made a mistake early on and made my pages public. Now I need to make them so that they all need signing in
01:37 < rocknroll_> It seems pretty difficult
01:39 < rocknroll_> and the permissions are a mess..
01:50 < modd_> go to the sites config
01:50 < modd_> click on one of the pages
01:50 < modd_> click on permissions
01:50 < modd_> and take away guest permissions
01:51 < modd_> do it for all pages that need signing
01:55 < rocknroll_> did that, thanks. Also added a login-page with sign  in portlet
01:55 < rocknroll_> so if user arrives at my site, he gets redirected to the login page, which is visible to guest
01:56 < rocknroll_> and after sign in, he gets redirected to either where he was originally going, or front pgae
01:56 < rocknroll_> yes, seems to work now :)
01:58 < rocknroll_> For future reference, is there a way to do this "in bulk"? This was pretty hard work for 100+ pages :P
02:01 < modd_> well, you can do it directly on the database, but doing things on the db is some kind of risky. ;)
02:04 < rocknroll_> I've noticed _>
03:19 < twen> hello
03:49 < modd_> hi
