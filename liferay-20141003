06:09 < Axxell:#liferay> Greetings fellow mamals.. allthough not maybe liferay related, is there any reason why apache with mod_jk connected to liferay would not be able to do a simple redirect 30 /old http://www.mysite.com/new
08:05 < Axxell:#liferay> hey, im having problems with date objects in service builder using ms sql server.. allthough this works with my testserver which uses mysql, when using mssql i get the following error: [JDBCExceptionReporter:82] Only dates between January 1, 1753 and December 31, 9999 are accepted.
10:23 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> hi there
10:24 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> we're facing problems migrating our layouts (or re-creating them). On what params is liferay looking to know the layout we deploy is the one he's looking for in the pages ?
10:25 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> As we have our server migrated but w/o the layouts. So pages are all mixed up. We would like to deploy our layouts and that liferay know they are those he's looking for in the pages
14:24 < bwood:#liferay> what are the maven and liferay version numbers for a theme running on Liferay 6.2 SP6?
14:37 < jardineworks_:#liferay> bwood, I use 6.2.10
14:37 < jardineworks_:#liferay> for the Liferay version...
14:37 < jardineworks_:#liferay> err.. wait, maybe its 6.2.1
14:37 < jardineworks_:#liferay> one sec
14:37 < douglascrp:#liferay> jardineworks_, hey dude
14:38 < douglascrp:#liferay> just to let you know I'm able to advance on the project
14:38 < douglascrp:#liferay> I got the form-navigator thing working now
14:39 < jardineworks_:#liferay> bwood, this is what I have in my profile --
14:39 < jardineworks_:#liferay>                  <liferay.version>6.2.1</liferay.version>
14:39 < jardineworks_:#liferay>                  <liferay.maven.plugin.version>6.2.1</liferay.maven.plugin.version>
14:39 < jardineworks_:#liferay> douglascrp, \o/
14:59 < bwood:#liferay> it deploys
14:59 < bwood:#liferay> just isn't avaliable in the liferay bundle
14:59 < bwood:#liferay> when I look for it under liferay look and feel
14:59 < bwood:#liferay> of a site
14:59 < bwood:#liferay> the theme isn't avaliable
15:00 < douglascrp:#liferay> how can I force my portlet form to show using all the screen width?
15:00 < douglascrp:#liferay> it's being shown using half of the screen
15:01 < douglascrp:#liferay> that's bacause I have the login portlet on the right
15:01 < jardineworks_:#liferay> douglascrp, how mamny columns are in your layout?
15:01 < douglascrp:#liferay> is there a way to make it open using all the width, over the login portlet?
15:01 < douglascrp:#liferay> 2
15:02 < jardineworks_:#liferay> and you want it to overlay on top of the login portlet?
15:02 < douglascrp:#liferay> yes
15:02 < jardineworks_:#liferay> i don't get it.
15:02 < douglascrp:#liferay> is that possible? on edit mode, make it use all the width?
15:02 < jardineworks_:#liferay> oh
15:02 < jardineworks_:#liferay> in configuration mode
15:03 < jardineworks_:#liferay> The only thing I think you can do is lauch the configuration as a modal window.
15:03 < jardineworks_:#liferay> kinda like how Liferay does in the control panel for .. say "Structures" (under wed content_
15:03 < jardineworks_:#liferay> )
15:04 < douglascrp:#liferay> do you know how to do that?
15:04 < douglascrp:#liferay> is it hard?
