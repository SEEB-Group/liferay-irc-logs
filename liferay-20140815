04:30 < Axxell:#liferay> Greetings fellow mamals, questiontime: How would i get which articles has the current page as its display page?
05:00 < bijoo_:#liferay> Axxell: I don't have much time to help you with this; but perhaps I can guide you to find it. Have you check the source code that displays it?
05:01 < bijoo_:#liferay> Axxell: if you follow that logic in reverse
05:50 < Axxell:#liferay> bijoo_: actually found out how to do it
05:50 < Axxell:#liferay> bijoo_: by using: JournalArticleServiceUtil.getArticlesByLayoutUuid
18:45 < bwood:#liferay> has anyone used the liferay-alloyui-update-tool?
18:45 < bwood:#liferay> Does it work with a theme on a maven build?
