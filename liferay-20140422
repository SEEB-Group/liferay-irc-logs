06:36 < NyB> Hi, is it possible to issue more than one success session messages from a portlet?
06:36 < NyB> I am using SessionMessages.add() but only one seems to be showing up
08:26 < modd_> is #alloyui dead?
12:48 < mojo2> bijoo both problems seems to be a linux prob
12:48 < mojo2> on windows everything works fine
12:49 < mojo2> so have to find the issu this way
12:52 < bijoo__> mojo2: meaning, when run portal linux, it's there; but when Windows, the issue is not there?
12:52 < mojo2> you are right
12:52 < bijoo__> mojo2: what's the code snipped for add the DL?
12:52 < bijoo__> snippet*
