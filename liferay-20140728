10:54 < circ-user-17zAv:#liferay> Hi, do you know how to change private page order in liferay control panel?
10:54 < circ-user-17zAv:#liferay> I can do it using drag an drop but just for few pages
10:54 < circ-user-17zAv:#liferay> i'm using liferay 6.1
11:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> circ-user-17zAv, if you open your inspector/firebug in your browser, on the console tab, do you see any JS errors starting to show after the first few repositions?
11:01 < bradley:#liferay> join #liferay-dev-life
11:02 < jardineworks:#liferay> bradley, is there a hangout today?
11:02 < bradley:#liferay> no tomorrow
11:03 < bradley:#liferay> I was trying to bookmark it
11:03 < bradley:#liferay> for tomorrow but accidentally put it in the chat.
11:03 < circ-user-17zAv:#liferay> @jardineworks: no, no error shown in console
11:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> bradley, lol -- good thing you did though! I forgot about it :)
11:05 < circ-user-17zAv:#liferay> i can move element until the 20th private pages
11:05 < bradley:#liferay> https://www.liferay.com/community/dev.life/home
11:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> circ-user-17zAv, and then what happens? it just rejects the movement?
11:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> bradley, Are you going to do a session?
11:05 < bradley:#liferay> no, I no longer work for Liferay since Nov. 2013
11:05 < circ-user-17zAv:#liferay> there is no movement..the above label are selected
11:06 < jardineworks:#liferay> bradley, so? I don't work for Liferay and I am doing a session at the end of Oct.
11:06 < jardineworks:#liferay> circ-user-17zAv, weird. But if you move it to the 19th position it works?
11:06 < circ-user-17zAv:#liferay> yes
11:06 < bradley:#liferay> oh I thought it was a liferay only
11:06 < jardineworks:#liferay> bradley, I don't think so. Either that or James is secretly offering me a job lol
11:07 < bradley:#liferay> lol
11:07 < jardineworks:#liferay> bradley, you should ask them if you can do something on front end dev .. theming magic.
11:07 < circ-user-17zAv:#liferay> i have also checked the customization property for that page
11:09 < circ-user-17zAv:#liferay> it seeme that operating on db table called layout, column priority, it works
11:13 < jardineworks:#liferay> circ-user-17zAv, the Layout table is where the "pages" are stored so you could manage it by hand there, but directly changing the database is of course never recommended.
11:15 < circ-user-17zAv:#liferay> i know, but if no other solution ...
