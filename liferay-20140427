07:29 < mojo> bijoo there?
07:39 < mojo> im adding documents with code you gave me. Now im adding categories with api and and attaching them to documents which i imported by api. Categories are shown in asset publisher for this documents, but if i choose by categoies navigation nothing is shown (with documents and media portlet it is working).
07:40 < mojo> this is how i add category -> AssetCategoryLocalServiceUtil.addCategory(userId, title, vocabularyId, serviceContext);
07:41 < mojo> this is how i attach categorie to document -> DLAppHelperLocalServiceUtil.updateAsset(userId, entry, entry.getLatestFileVersion(), categoryIds, null, null);
07:41 < mojo>                     AssetCategoryLocalServiceUtil.addAssetEntryAssetCategories(entry.getFileEntryId(), categoryIds);
08:19 < bijoo_> Naenyn: http://pastebin.com/1qniarFv
08:19 < bijoo_> Naenyn: it shows how they are related here.
08:27 < bijoo_> Naenyn: - User clicks login -> enter credentials -> submit
08:27 < bijoo_> Naenyn: - Invoker filter triggered-> filters intercept -> Custom CAS Filter intercepts -> verifies identity against CAS -> if successful, set the custom CASThreadLocal (which you'll need to create, see for example MessageValuesThreadLocal.java ) attribute for  username to the username; also be sure to add any needed cookies or whatever for SSO to work -> the rest of the filters are invoked
08:27 < bijoo_> Naenyn: - The Authentication pipeline is called -> any custom Authentictars are called  (if you don't want Liferay DB to be checked for pw, there is a property for that, check in portal.properties, something like "[skip liferay db check]") -> the custom authentictor is called and it should check the custom CASThreadLocal  attribute for username, if it's not empty it should get that to be the user logged in and then clear the attribute v
08:27 < bijoo_> Naenyn: -  The filters are visited again to do post-request processing
08:31 < bijoo_> mojo: have you compared with the Liferay source there?
08:31 < mojo> you mean in documentslibrary?
08:31 < bijoo_> mojo: I would just go through step by step here (e.g. setup the debugger, breakpoints) and see exactly what OOB does. Then replicate the same in your own code.
08:31 < mojo> sry im to new
08:32 < bijoo_> mojo: yes, have you setup debugger before?
08:32 < bijoo_> mojo: once you do it, all your questions are solved.
08:32 < bijoo_> mojo: although will need to dig around a bit.
08:34 < mojo> dont know exactly what u mean
08:35 < mojo> u mean debugging adding category in liferay portal?
08:37 < bijoo_> mojo: right, so do it through OOB method.
08:37 < bijoo_> So setup debugger and all breakpoints; then just add the category and see.
08:56 < mojo> so i have to create a hook of this portlet and debug there?
09:08 < mojo> its fine found src of liferay
19:06 < scribe> Hi guys.  Anyone done an upgrade from 6.1ga2 to 6.2ga2?
19:07 < scribe> I've just done a test upgrade of our live data on our dev box and it seems like a few major problems happened.  e.g, our custom roles are present, but no users are assigned to these roles.
21:59 < bijoo_> scribe: I recently did a test upgrade there; to see what kind of trouble I'd get in; and ran into some API changes. I didn't find much OOB issues; just the custom dev needed some work there.
