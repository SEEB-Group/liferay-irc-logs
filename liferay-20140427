07:29 < mojo> bijoo there?
07:39 < mojo> im adding documents with code you gave me. Now im adding categories with api and and attaching them to documents which i imported by api. Categories are shown in asset publisher for this documents, but if i choose by categoies navigation nothing is shown (with documents and media portlet it is working).
07:40 < mojo> this is how i add category -> AssetCategoryLocalServiceUtil.addCategory(userId, title, vocabularyId, serviceContext);
07:41 < mojo> this is how i attach categorie to document -> DLAppHelperLocalServiceUtil.updateAsset(userId, entry, entry.getLatestFileVersion(), categoryIds, null, null);
07:41 < mojo>                     AssetCategoryLocalServiceUtil.addAssetEntryAssetCategories(entry.getFileEntryId(), categoryIds);

08:19 < bijoo_> Naenyn: it shows how they are related here.
08:27 < bijoo_> Naenyn: - User clicks login -> enter credentials -> submit
08:27 < bijoo_> Naenyn: - Invoker filter triggered-> filters intercept -> Custom CAS Filter intercepts -> verifies identity against CAS -> if successful, set the custom CASThreadLocal (which you'll need to create, see for example MessageValuesThreadLocal.java ) attribute for  username to the username; also be sure to add any needed cookies or whatever for SSO to work -> the rest of the filters are invoked
08:27 < bijoo_> Naenyn: - The Authentication pipeline is called -> any custom Authentictars are called  (if you don't want Liferay DB to be checked for pw, there is a property for that, check in portal.properties, something like "[skip liferay db check]") -> the custom authentictor is called and it should check the custom CASThreadLocal  attribute for username, if it's not empty it should get that to be the user logged in and then clear the attribute v
08:27 < bijoo_> Naenyn: -  The filters are visited again to do post-request processing
08:31 < bijoo_> mojo: have you compared with the Liferay source there?
