10:12 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> hi there
10:13 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> big - horrible - problem here. Working with maven and liferay 6.1.2, we encounter that : java.lang.ClassCastException: com.sun.proxy.$Proxy725 cannot be cast to com.liferay.portlet.PortletPreferencesWrapper. We're lost. Desperated.
10:32 < jardineworks:#liferay> nicolas_FR, I think I usually use PortletPreferences object from the javax.portlet package
10:35 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> jardineworks: we do too. but it seems we have 2 jar with this class, and it creates the exception. But we're not able to find where
10:36 < jardineworks:#liferay> nicolas_FR, you mean you are trying to find out which class the "$Proxy725" is?
10:41 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> jardineworks: we're trying to find why we have this classCastException. We were good, I deploy 1 portlet, and this error happens. I undeploy the portlet, the error stays (on another portlet). Seems once it's broken for one, it's broken for every portlets using PortalUtil.getPreferences(request)
10:46 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> we're looking at portal-impl.jar and portal-service.jar, as it seems the class comes from there
10:57 < jardineworks:#liferay> nicolas_FR, do you get the same result if you use ANT? (not suggesting that you should switch -- but it might help narrow the problem to a maven archetype or build)
11:01 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> aside from this, anyone know where to find the versions of dependencies of Liferay 6.1.2 ?
11:01 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> jardineworks: well we migrated all our projects to maven... and others works, with the same dependencies
11:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> nicolas_FR, personally, I'm not nuts about maven, even in 6.2. When I tried it with 6.1 it was nothing but problems for me
11:06 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> jardineworks: ugh. well.. the war generated just include the jar we need, so I don't know what would be bad with it
11:06 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> but I can double check that
11:07 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> just for confirmation, portal-service.jar should not be in our .war right ? Just a compilation dependence..
11:18 < jardineworks:#liferay> nicolas_FR, correct
11:18 < jardineworks:#liferay> nicolas_FR, are you using Tomcast?
11:18 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tomcat*
11:23 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> yes tomcat 7
11:34 < jardineworks:#liferay> nicolas_FR, right, so the portal-service.jar is not needed for your plugins because it is already in the global class loader picked up from TOMCAT_HOME/lib/ext.
11:37 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> well we don't include it. It's <scope>provided</scope> and looking at the WEB-INF/lib, we seems to be ok
11:38 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> exception comes from : at com.liferay.portal.util.PortalImpl.getPreferences(PortalImpl.java:3973)
11:41 < jardineworks:#liferay> nicolas_FR, sure ... but that is just the implementation class for accessing the preferences right? if your plugin is using preferences then the code you write will be proxied through the portal-service jar classes to the implementation class in the portal-impl jar.
