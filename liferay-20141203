10:12 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> hi there
10:13 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> big - horrible - problem here. Working with maven and liferay 6.1.2, we encounter that : java.lang.ClassCastException: com.sun.proxy.$Proxy725 cannot be cast to com.liferay.portlet.PortletPreferencesWrapper. We're lost. Desperated.
10:32 < jardineworks:#liferay> nicolas_FR, I think I usually use PortletPreferences object from the javax.portlet package
10:35 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> jardineworks: we do too. but it seems we have 2 jar with this class, and it creates the exception. But we're not able to find where
10:36 < jardineworks:#liferay> nicolas_FR, you mean you are trying to find out which class the "$Proxy725" is?
10:41 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> jardineworks: we're trying to find why we have this classCastException. We were good, I deploy 1 portlet, and this error happens. I undeploy the portlet, the error stays (on another portlet). Seems once it's broken for one, it's broken for every portlets using PortalUtil.getPreferences(request)
10:46 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> we're looking at portal-impl.jar and portal-service.jar, as it seems the class comes from there
10:57 < jardineworks:#liferay> nicolas_FR, do you get the same result if you use ANT? (not suggesting that you should switch -- but it might help narrow the problem to a maven archetype or build)
11:01 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> aside from this, anyone know where to find the versions of dependencies of Liferay 6.1.2 ?
11:01 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> jardineworks: well we migrated all our projects to maven... and others works, with the same dependencies
11:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> nicolas_FR, personally, I'm not nuts about maven, even in 6.2. When I tried it with 6.1 it was nothing but problems for me
11:06 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> jardineworks: ugh. well.. the war generated just include the jar we need, so I don't know what would be bad with it
