01:55 < goku_> hi,am getting "beanLocator is null for the context" exception in liferay 6.2 ? how to fix it
03:29 < goku_> how to make liferay service layer update timestamp on insertion ?
03:29 < goku_> to the DB?
04:19 < Yam`> hi
04:27 < Yam`> what's the best way to store custom webpage and use them in portlets? (in iframe or embedded page)
07:32 < rocknroll_> hi. how to make jspf-includes compile every time? this is driving me nuts, having to mess with a whole load of pages that include other pages that include other pages that include...
09:30 < jardineworks> rocknroll_, I would assume that disabling jsp caching and the checks would do it?
09:36 < Yam`> jardineworks, any idea how I can embed a webpage I created (with all the html, the javascript and css files) in liferay? Like where I should put the files in order to make link between this webpage and liferay possible. Example: a button in this page opens a liferay page created using the control panel
09:37 < jardineworks> Yam`, I think there is an iframe portlet isn't there?
09:41 < Yam``> jardineworks, yes but where should I put my files?
09:41 < Yam``> (the liferay path)
09:42 < jardineworks> Yam`, Oh I see. You mean, where do you put the HTML page with the buttons that link to Liferay?
09:43 < Yam``> jardineworks, yes that's it :)
09:43 < jardineworks> hmmm -- why do you have a separate page if you want to have it in liferay anyway?
09:47 < Yam``> because I'm have custom forms that I create with ajax and manage using javascript, plus I use bootstrap
09:48 < Yam``> -'m
09:48 < jardineworks> Yam``, which version of Liferay are you on?
09:49 < Yam``> 6.2
09:49 < jardineworks> Yam``, which version of bootstrap are you using?
09:49 < Yam``> the latest
09:49 < jardineworks> I see
