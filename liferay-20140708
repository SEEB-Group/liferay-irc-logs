09:36 < Yam`> jardineworks, any idea how I can embed a webpage I created (with all the html, the javascript and css files) in liferay? Like where I should put the files in order to make link between this webpage and liferay possible. Example: a button in this page opens a liferay page created using the control panel
09:37 < jardineworks> Yam`, I think there is an iframe portlet isn't there?

09:42 < jardineworks> Yam`, Oh I see. You mean, where do you put the HTML page with the buttons that link to Liferay?
09:43 < Yam``> jardineworks, yes that's it :)
