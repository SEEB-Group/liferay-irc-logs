01:55 < goku_> hi,am getting "beanLocator is null for the context" exception in liferay 6.2 ? how to fix it
03:29 < goku_> how to make liferay service layer update timestamp on insertion ?
03:29 < goku_> to the DB?
04:19 < Yam`> hi
04:27 < Yam`> what's the best way to store custom webpage and use them in portlets? (in iframe or embedded page)
07:32 < rocknroll_> hi. how to make jspf-includes compile every time? this is driving me nuts, having to mess with a whole load of pages that include other pages that include other pages that include...
09:30 < jardineworks> rocknroll_, I would assume that disabling jsp caching and the checks would do it?
09:36 < Yam`> jardineworks, any idea how I can embed a webpage I created (with all the html, the javascript and css files) in liferay? Like where I should put the files in order to make link between this webpage and liferay possible. Example: a button in this page opens a liferay page created using the control panel
09:37 < jardineworks> Yam`, I think there is an iframe portlet isn't there?
09:41 < Yam``> jardineworks, yes but where should I put my files?
09:41 < Yam``> (the liferay path)
09:42 < jardineworks> Yam`, Oh I see. You mean, where do you put the HTML page with the buttons that link to Liferay?
09:43 < Yam``> jardineworks, yes that's it :)
09:43 < jardineworks> hmmm -- why do you have a separate page if you want to have it in liferay anyway?
09:47 < Yam``> because I'm have custom forms that I create with ajax and manage using javascript, plus I use bootstrap
09:48 < Yam``> -'m
09:48 < jardineworks> Yam``, which version of Liferay are you on?
09:49 < Yam``> 6.2
09:49 < jardineworks> Yam``, which version of bootstrap are you using?
09:49 < Yam``> the latest
09:49 < jardineworks> I see
09:50 < jardineworks> Yam``, well, the only thing that I am not sure about is how to upgrade the portal to the latest version of bootstrap... I think 6.2 ships with the 2.6 version of bootstrap. But for the other stuff, javascript that allows you to dynamically create forms etc, there is no reason why that can't be placed into a portlet.
09:51 < jardineworks> In fact, you can probably just make a portlet, take you html/css/js and put it in the portlet and deploy it.
09:51 < Yam``> where do I put it in a portlet ?
09:55 < Yam``> or maybe I should create my own portlet, I don't know (I'm not used to portlets and this kind of modular portals, that's my first time using it)
09:55 < jardineworks> Yam``, Are you using the Liferay IDE?
09:55 < Yam``> jardineworks, no
09:56 < jardineworks> Yam``, and this is your first time with LR?
09:56 < Yam``> yes this is
09:56 < jardineworks> Yam``, ok ... I can walk you through this.. .but it will take a while :)
09:57 < Yam``> I'm all yours if you don't mind me taking your time :)
09:57 < jardineworks> Yam``, Liferay is easy to use, but the technology and the learnign curve can be a bit high out the gate.
09:57 < jardineworks> Yam``, ok... do you have a liferay server setup on your local machine?
09:58 < Yam``> jardineworks, yes
09:58 < Yam``> the community version
09:59 < jardineworks> Yam``, connected to a database (doesn't really matter, just trying to get a lay of the land on your end)
09:59 < Yam``> yes, MySQL
10:00 < jardineworks> Yam``, What OS are you on?
10:00 < Yam``> I'm using elementary OS as an OS if that matters (it's an ubuntu based distribution)
10:00 < jardineworks> ok
10:00 < jardineworks> have you downloaded the SDK?
10:01 < Yam``> I don't think so
10:01 < jardineworks> are you a java programmer? :)
10:01 < Yam``> A begginer one but yes
10:01 < jardineworks> ok cool
10:01 < Yam``> (I'm in an engineering course, third year)
10:01 < jardineworks> one sec phone
10:01 < Yam``> np
10:04 -!- mode/#liferay [+o jhf] by ChanServ
10:06 < jardineworks> Yam``, download the Plugins SDK from here -- https://www.liferay.com/downloads/liferay-portal/available-releases
10:07 < Yam``> I checked and for the moment I've got the bundle with tomcat
10:08 < Yam``> do I need Eclipse and JDK? I've installed liferay in a VM and I don't have it yet
10:10 < nancy_> Ho how to remove alfresco application from the application menu in liferay
10:10 < nancy_> ?
10:10 < nancy_> can anybody help me out resolving this issue?
10:11 < jardineworks> Yam``, you will need eclipse of some kind .. one sec.
10:14 < jardineworks> Yam``, https://www.liferay.com/downloads/liferay-projects/liferay-ide from the drop down, be sure to choose a version of Eclipse + <something>
10:14 < jardineworks> nancy_, you mean like an Alfresco portlet?
10:15 < nancy_> No from the leftmenu we will drag and drop the document libraries from alfresco application.
10:16 < nancy_> That application i want to delete
10:16 < jardineworks> nancy_, can you share a screenshot with me? I'm not sure what "the left menu" is
10:16 < jardineworks> oh I see
10:16 < jardineworks> the one that slides out in 6.2
10:16 < jardineworks> under the applications section
10:16 < nancy_> yes
10:16 < jardineworks> those applications are portlets so we're talking about the same thing
10:16 < nancy_> ohh k
10:16 < jardineworks> set the category for the portlet in the liferay-portlet.xml to hidden
10:17 < jardineworks> .. this is assuming you have access to the portlet code?
10:17 < nancy_> i didn't understand
10:18 < nancy_> i will share you screenshot
10:18 < jardineworks> the "applications" ... for them to appear you deploy a war right? Do you have access to that WAR code?
10:18 < nancy_> yes
10:19 < jardineworks> ok what's the name of the project that has that code in it?
10:19 < Yam``> jardineworks, I'm downloading the IDE, do I need to install ant?
10:20 < jardineworks> Yam``, yeah... you should be able to sudo apt-get ant to install it from the Ubuntu universe
10:21 < Yam``> ok, ty
10:23 < nancy_> No this is not portlet
10:23 < jardineworks> nancy_, what is the name of the projecT?
10:23 < nancy_> Like news,wiki this is also an application
10:23 < jardineworks> news and wiki are portlets
10:23 < jardineworks> if it shows up in the application menu, it's a portlet :)
10:24 < nancy_> Earlier alfresco portlet was not there in menu
10:24 < nancy_> After installing alfresco it has appeared in that menu
10:24 < nancy_> actually what my issue is
10:24 -!- mode/#liferay [+o _jhf_] by ChanServ
10:25 < nancy_> I am trying to drag document libraries to the page
10:26 < nancy_> but it showing screen by saying login through your portal.
10:26 < nancy_> Have you understood my issue?
10:26 < jardineworks> nancy_, I've never done anything with Alfresco, but it sounds like a configuration is missing
10:26 < jardineworks> it sounds like Alfresco is challenging for credentials.
10:27 < nancy_> ohh k
10:28 < nancy_> first time after alfresco installation and configuration i am able to drag document and libraries
10:28 < nancy_> into the liferay page
10:29 < nancy_> But from second time it is showing screen by saying login through your portal
10:30 < Yam``> sigh, my work Internet connection is so shitty, I've been downloading the IDE for 10 minutes and the estimate remaining time was 3 hours so I launched the download from my cellphone and it took two minutes to download...
10:34 < jardineworks> nancy_, when you say configuration... what does that mean? are you configuring it in Liferay?
10:34 < nancy_> yes
10:34 < jardineworks> nancy_, Have you done something like this? https://www.liferay.com/web/navin.agarwal11/blog/-/blogs/integration-with-alfresco-4-x-and-liferay-6-1
10:35 < jardineworks> I know the version of LR is different, but I doubt this has changed from 6.1 to 5.2
10:35 < jardineworks> 6.2*
10:35 < nancy_> exactly
10:35 < nancy_> i have done the same
10:36 < jardineworks> hmm
10:36 < jardineworks> and you are logged into the portal?
10:36 < jardineworks> nancy_, ^^
10:37 < nancy_> i didn't understand the note what he has mentioned i.e, NOTE: If you are not using any SSO for both servers, Make sure you create a same user admin/admin in Liferay. Doing this you will have common user in both environment.
10:37 < nancy_> yes
10:37 < nancy_> i have logged in
10:40 < jardineworks> just means that in an SSO situation, both Liferay and Alfresco should be wired to the same directory store.
10:40 < jardineworks> are you using LDAP auth?
10:40 < nancy_> no
10:40 < jardineworks> and you are not using openSSO either right?
10:40 < jardineworks> just plain email/password authentication?
10:41 < nancy_> I am logging in through email and password in liferay
10:42 < nancy_> where as for alfresco login i am not using email just with username i am logging in
10:44 < jardineworks> hmm
10:44 < jardineworks> nancy_, sorry... I need to take of something. I will be back though
10:44 < nancy_> k fine
11:28 < nicolas_FR> hi there
11:30 < nicolas_FR> got a blocking problem after undeploying 1 theme and 1 portlet : http://pastebin.com/dEgmynMH. Both are custom portlets and first time in.. years... that I encounter this problem.
11:31 < nicolas_FR> we work on those portlets actually so I was undeploying and re-deploying those, and now server just don't want to hot-deploy them (.war in /deploy)
11:32 < nicolas_FR> I tried to take those porlets from another server (already deployed portlets from webapps/portlet directory) and paste them in the /webapps/ directory... same error
11:33 < nicolas_FR> Server seems down and I'm blocked
11:37 < jardineworks> nicolas_FR, What version of LR?
11:38 < nicolas_FR> 5.2.3
11:38 < nicolas_FR> I'm doing this for month (years) and suddenly... nothing is working
11:40 < jardineworks> nicolas_FR, maybe this? https://issues.liferay.com/browse/LPS-3796
11:42 < nicolas_FR> I found this issue but... 1 - why today, suddenly ? 2 - no answer in the thread or ?
11:44 < nicolas_FR> I posted here : https://www.liferay.com/community/forums/-/message_boards/message/39783436 If anyone has some clue, please answer there. Thanks*
12:05 < rocknroll_> jardineworks, thanks, how do i go about that?
12:05 < rocknroll_> ie. disable jsp cache
12:10 < jardineworks> rocknroll_, usually it is handled with request headers --- just checking to see if there is a property in LR
12:13 < jardineworks> rocknroll_, you could try this one...
12:13 < jardineworks>     #
12:13 < jardineworks>     # Set this to true to cache the content of layout templates. This is
12:13 < jardineworks>     # recommended because it improves performance for production servers.
12:13 < jardineworks>     # Setting it to false is useful during development if you need to make a lot
12:13 < jardineworks>     # of changes.
12:13 < jardineworks>     #
12:13 < jardineworks>     layout.template.cache.enabled=true
12:13 < jardineworks> change it to false in your portal-ext
12:13 < jardineworks> also -- last.modified.check=false
12:14 < jardineworks> err.. last one is an old one I think
12:17 < jardineworks> rocknroll_, you could also try adding these settings to you tomcat context.xml: antiResourceLocking="false"
12:17 < jardineworks> cachingAllowed="false"
12:17 < jardineworks> ... and don't forget about browser caching :)
13:14 < rocknroll_> hey thanks, will give that a go :)
13:21 < jshinergy> whats good everyone!
14:56 < jardineworks> Yamw_, how's it going? you get the dev env. setup?
14:58 < jardineworks> nicolas_FR, you still there?
15:52 < jshinergy> is there any crm projects for liferay?
