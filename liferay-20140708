01:55 < goku_> hi,am getting "beanLocator is null for the context" exception in liferay 6.2 ? how to fix it
03:29 < goku_> how to make liferay service layer update timestamp on insertion ?
03:29 < goku_> to the DB?
04:19 < Yam`> hi
04:27 < Yam`> what's the best way to store custom webpage and use them in portlets? (in iframe or embedded page)
07:32 < rocknroll_> hi. how to make jspf-includes compile every time? this is driving me nuts, having to mess with a whole load of pages that include other pages that include other pages that include...
09:30 < jardineworks> rocknroll_, I would assume that disabling jsp caching and the checks would do it?
09:36 < Yam`> jardineworks, any idea how I can embed a webpage I created (with all the html, the javascript and css files) in liferay? Like where I should put the files in order to make link between this webpage and liferay possible. Example: a button in this page opens a liferay page created using the control panel
09:37 < jardineworks> Yam`, I think there is an iframe portlet isn't there?
09:41 < Yam``> jardineworks, yes but where should I put my files?
09:41 < Yam``> (the liferay path)
09:42 < jardineworks> Yam`, Oh I see. You mean, where do you put the HTML page with the buttons that link to Liferay?
09:43 < Yam``> jardineworks, yes that's it :)
09:43 < jardineworks> hmmm -- why do you have a separate page if you want to have it in liferay anyway?
09:47 < Yam``> because I'm have custom forms that I create with ajax and manage using javascript, plus I use bootstrap
09:48 < Yam``> -'m
09:48 < jardineworks> Yam``, which version of Liferay are you on?
09:49 < Yam``> 6.2
09:49 < jardineworks> Yam``, which version of bootstrap are you using?
09:49 < Yam``> the latest
09:49 < jardineworks> I see
09:50 < jardineworks> Yam``, well, the only thing that I am not sure about is how to upgrade the portal to the latest version of bootstrap... I think 6.2 ships with the 2.6 version of bootstrap. But for the other stuff, javascript that allows you to dynamically create forms etc, there is no reason why that can't be placed into a portlet.
09:51 < jardineworks> In fact, you can probably just make a portlet, take you html/css/js and put it in the portlet and deploy it.
09:51 < Yam``> where do I put it in a portlet ?
09:55 < Yam``> or maybe I should create my own portlet, I don't know (I'm not used to portlets and this kind of modular portals, that's my first time using it)
09:55 < jardineworks> Yam``, Are you using the Liferay IDE?
09:55 < Yam``> jardineworks, no
09:56 < jardineworks> Yam``, and this is your first time with LR?
09:56 < Yam``> yes this is
09:56 < jardineworks> Yam``, ok ... I can walk you through this.. .but it will take a while :)
09:57 < Yam``> I'm all yours if you don't mind me taking your time :)
09:57 < jardineworks> Yam``, Liferay is easy to use, but the technology and the learnign curve can be a bit high out the gate.
09:57 < jardineworks> Yam``, ok... do you have a liferay server setup on your local machine?
09:58 < Yam``> jardineworks, yes
09:58 < Yam``> the community version
09:59 < jardineworks> Yam``, connected to a database (doesn't really matter, just trying to get a lay of the land on your end)
09:59 < Yam``> yes, MySQL
10:00 < jardineworks> Yam``, What OS are you on?
10:00 < Yam``> I'm using elementary OS as an OS if that matters (it's an ubuntu based distribution)
10:00 < jardineworks> ok
10:00 < jardineworks> have you downloaded the SDK?
10:01 < Yam``> I don't think so
10:01 < jardineworks> are you a java programmer? :)
10:01 < Yam``> A begginer one but yes
10:01 < jardineworks> ok cool
10:01 < Yam``> (I'm in an engineering course, third year)

10:06 < jardineworks> Yam``, download the Plugins SDK from here -- https://www.liferay.com/downloads/liferay-portal/available-releases
