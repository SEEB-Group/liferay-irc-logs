04:42 < hufg:#liferay> helloo helloo
04:42 < hufg:#liferay> any ideas how replicating lucene indexes across the cluster works?
04:43 < hufg:#liferay> what if one node is down and no reindex on startup
04:43 < hufg:#liferay> does it poll the cluster for newest indexes
04:43 < hufg:#liferay> shutdown one node for 1 week start without reindex on startup and what happens?
04:46 < hufg:#liferay> topolik ? 8)
04:46 < topolik:#liferay> hi hufg
04:46 < topolik:#liferay> I'm sorry, I knew that but I forgot :D
04:47 < topolik:#liferay> there are 2 ways - the cluster sends only incremental changes or when new instance shows it sends everything
04:47 < topolik:#liferay> but I'm not able to remember what's the right one :)
05:37 < spandana:#liferay> hi..am getting the following error while running a spring portlet hibernate application..can you please help me..The error i got is Initial SessionFactory creation failed.java.lang.IncompatibleClassChangeError: Implementing class
07:19 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik, hufg I'm not sure about the latest versions but I know that I had a problem for a client once on 5.2.3 around this. He had some shit code that caused the servers to crash every 15 minutes, so they were constantly restarting themselves. In fact the sysadmin had a script that would restart them every 10 minutes before they had a chance to crash. Anyway, one of the main issues was his search indices were always out of whack.
07:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> ... so I would have guessed incremental changes for that version at least.
08:14 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Hey guys...has anyone of you ever experienced that Web Content Articles immediately go live despite staging being activated?
08:14 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> We have some serious issues with that at the moment, because the content people try to prepare some updates and they show up on live immediately.
08:58 < AdminInNeed:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur: no, never seen that before, which version?
08:59 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> AdminInNeed: 6.1.0
09:04 < AdminInNeed:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur: 6.1.0 GA1, 6.1.0 RC1, 6.1.0 B4, or 6.1.0 B3?
09:05 < AdminInNeed:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur: I'm going to check OOB real quick; so need to know exact version you have.
09:07 < jardineworks:#liferay> AdminInNeed, I would guess GA1. mNot many people try to use a beta release in production.
09:10 < AdminInNeed:#liferay> jardineworks: Thanks; I'll try that; but doubt that has issue. Liferay would have caught that in QA tests.
09:11 < AdminInNeed:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur: is this remote staging or local one?
09:28 -!- mode/#liferay [+o jhf] by ChanServ
09:41 < AdminInNeed:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur: it's not without issue (e.g. https://issues.liferay.com/browse/LPS-23332 ) but works on the whole of it.
09:42 < AdminInNeed:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur: could not reproduce what you described; that is, content is properly staged.
09:42 < AdminInNeed:#liferay> Hi, why do automatic updates download flash plugin on headless ubuntu server?
09:42 < AdminInNeed:#liferay> It seems like a waste since only lynx is installed; no ff, chrome, or etc.
10:00 < AdminInNeed:#liferay> Whoops meant to type that in #ubuntu-server
10:41 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> AdminInNeed: Sorry. People keep drawing me into meetings...
10:43 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> AdminInNeed: It's a really weird issue I can't make sense of.
10:44 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Could it be that the pages and articles were created before staging was activated and something went wrong when they switched?
10:45 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Because it sure looks like the article from staging is linked to the web content view on the page.
11:45 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Anyway. Have a nice weekend. :)
12:48 < darkos:#liferay> hello james @jhf
12:48 <@jhf:#liferay> hey darkos
12:48 <@jhf:#liferay> how's it going? see the news regarding GlassFish 4 commercial support ?
12:48 < darkos:#liferay> finally managed to catch you!
12:49 < darkos:#liferay> no.  what's the news?
12:49 <@jhf:#liferay> oracle will not provide commercial support for GF anymore. only commercial support for Weblogic
12:49 < darkos:#liferay> really?
12:49 < darkos:#liferay> wow.
12:50 < darkos:#liferay> perhaps they did too good a job with the community version
12:50 <@jhf:#liferay> haha.. well they will continue to use GF as the JavaEE reference implementation and it'll remain open source (for the moment)
12:50 <@jhf:#liferay> but they want their commercial users on Weblogic
12:50 <@jhf:#liferay> https://www.google.com/search?q=glassfish+4+commercial&oq=glassfish+4+commercial
12:50 < darkos:#liferay> could also be that much of the good stuff from GF is being rolled into WebLogic
12:50 < darkos:#liferay> hmmmm
12:51 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah I think the original vision during the sun transition was that GF and WL would be built on the same osgi foundation.
12:51 <@jhf:#liferay> dunno if that ever made into reality though
12:51 < darkos:#liferay> well, what I wanted to check with you on was regarding the DDL issue I stumbled upon
12:51 <@jhf:#liferay> ok
12:52 < darkos:#liferay> did you see my past messages here about the issue?
12:52 <@jhf:#liferay> nope
12:52 <@jhf:#liferay> when was that? I can check the log.
12:52 < darkos:#liferay> I have tried it using both the tomcat and glassfish bundles, and it appears to be the same behavior on both.
12:52 < darkos:#liferay> oh, during the last week.
12:52 <@jhf:#liferay> found it
12:52 <@jhf:#liferay> http://liferay.seebgroup.com/irc/liferay-20131112
12:53 <@jhf:#liferay> (nar the bottom)
12:53 < darkos:#liferay> the guts of it is that when you use the DDL form templates, if you burry input fields inside the container gui widgets for grouping, the form fails to save the data.
12:53 <@jhf:#liferay> when you say "dynamic data form add-on" do you mean the 'kaleo forms' EE plugin?
12:54 <@jhf:#liferay> err no wait.. apologies.. there is a ddl-forms plugin isn't there. checking...
12:54 < darkos:#liferay> the one I'm talking about is the ddl-forms plugin
12:55 < darkos:#liferay> I have not tried / do not know about the kaleo one.  that's a workflow engine, and I don't use it, have no interest so far in it.
13:01 <@jhf:#liferay> ok. I am gonna try and see if I can reproduce it.
13:02 <@jhf:#liferay> so you are creating a custom display template (not a form template) for displaying the data in the DDL right?
13:03 <@jhf:#liferay> or are you making a form template (shown when users are entering new records)
13:06 < darkos:#liferay> no
13:06 < darkos:#liferay> I'm just concerned about the form template currently
13:07 < darkos:#liferay> as in what's used when users submit data
13:07 < darkos:#liferay> you see when you create the data definition, it's all about the field data.
13:08 <@jhf:#liferay> ok. so, so far I created a new data definition (first name, last name, DOB, email), and created a list from it, and plopped it on a page using the "DDL Display" template - I can add new records. When I turn on edit controls at the bottom, I see an option to add a Form Template - but I have not yet installed the ddl-forms plugin.. I wonder why that is.
13:08 < darkos:#liferay> yep, the ddl-forms plugin has to be installed from the marketplace.  for some reason it's not bundled in
13:09 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah but even without doing that, I see an option to create a new ddl form. and when I click on it, I get the GUI form editor.
13:09 <@jhf:#liferay> i'm surprised, since I dnd't install the ddl-form plugin yet.
13:10 < darkos:#liferay> ah, that's because it's part of the data definition aspect
13:10 < darkos:#liferay> you can go ahead and create the form template I guess.
13:10 <@jhf:#liferay> ok. and how did you group them? using a field set + paragraph (to contain your header)?
13:11 < darkos:#liferay> just dragged the field-set to the right hand side
13:11 < darkos:#liferay> then, dragged the two existing fields so that they are inside the field set at the same depth.
13:13 < darkos:#liferay> I also renamed the field set to 'about you'
13:13 < darkos:#liferay> ie: so that the heading shows up and within it are the first and last name fields
13:14 < darkos:#liferay> you could just as easily name it 'name' and just have 'first' and 'last'
13:14 < darkos:#liferay> ie: name for the fieldset
13:16 <@jhf:#liferay> yep I get the same thing: the firstname/lastname doesn't show up: http://imgur.com/82gVgpL
13:16 < darkos:#liferay> congratulations! and thank you
13:16 <@jhf:#liferay> heh.. lemme look around a bit before filing any issue.
13:17 <@jhf:#liferay> but yeah that's a bug.
13:17 <@jhf:#liferay> wondering if it's a known issue
13:19 <@jhf:#liferay> hmm sounds like https://issues.liferay.com/browse/LPS-23689 which was supposedly fixed
13:23 < darkos:#liferay> similar, but not the same
13:23 < darkos:#liferay> it appears that this issue you found was with reference to display of data
13:24 < darkos:#liferay> not to do with capture / storage of data
13:24 < darkos:#liferay> looking at the steps to reproduce the issue, there's no mention of creating a form and capturing data
13:26 <@jhf:#liferay> well LPS-23689 complains that data isn't showing up when you view the records
13:26 <@jhf:#liferay> which I also encountered in my screenshot
13:26 <@jhf:#liferay> I shall check the database
13:26 <@jhf:#liferay> (which I think is what you were originally saying was wrong)
13:27 <@jhf:#liferay> my guess is it's not in there and I further guess that it wasn't in the DB for the reporter of LPS-23689
13:31 <@jhf:#liferay> yep, not in there.
13:32 <@jhf:#liferay> ok want me to file this bug?
13:32 <@jhf:#liferay> or do you want the pleasure of filing :)
13:32 <@jhf:#liferay> I guess the workaround is to not use a fieldset
13:49 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, form question for you
13:50 < jardineworks:#liferay> I have a page where I am dynamically generating select fields. Page A might have 2 of them, Page B 5 lets say
13:50 < jardineworks:#liferay> they all relate back to the same thing .. Item options for an order item.
13:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> in some languages (.NET, php, etc) ... you can name these boxes name="orderItemOption[1]" where the value in the square bracket represents the order item option id.
13:52 < jardineworks:#liferay> when the form is posted back to the server then it will allow you to retrieve orderItemOption as a list and then you can iterate over the list and for item with id 1, you get value <whatever>, move to the next etc.
13:52 < jardineworks:#liferay> bascially allows you to dynamically process dynamic form fields :S
13:53 < jardineworks:#liferay> do you know if LR supports that same [x] notation?
13:53 <@jhf:#liferay> I don't think so, but i'll look around a bit.
14:03 <@jhf:#liferay> well can't find anything (and I'm not enough of a web developer to know by heart). closest I found was http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9074470/how-to-retrieve-multiple-select-value
14:06 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, ok thanks. I appreciate the google... though you didn't have to do that for me :)
14:06 < jardineworks:#liferay> above and beyond ;)
14:06 <@jhf:#liferay> well I learn something every time :)
14:06 <@jhf:#liferay> like, now I know how to handle multiple choice forms :)
14:12 <@jhf:#liferay> darkos: https://issues.liferay.com/browse/LPS-42351
14:15 < modd:#liferay> jhf: lr presentation at my old university: check
14:15 < modd:#liferay> ;)
14:15 <@jhf:#liferay> oooohh really?? nice!
14:16 <@jhf:#liferay> any record or pics or something I can use to get others to do the same? :)
14:17 < modd:#liferay> some universities here want to develop some new kind of student account and grades system
14:17 < modd:#liferay> maybe on liferay
14:17 < modd:#liferay> just my german slides, sry
14:17 < modd:#liferay> but you can have them
14:17 < modd:#liferay> I also prepared a little 6.2 demo
14:18 < modd:#liferay> the new responsive design with the new preview was something they liked a lot
14:18 <@jhf:#liferay> cool.. glad to see you (and they) liked it... it demos nicely now.
14:18 <@jhf:#liferay> no more "hello world" and a login portlet. well you still get that :) but it's much prettier
14:19 < modd:#liferay> we'll try to help them with their development (my company is lr gold partner since ~1 month)
14:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, another one for you... if I use the liferay-portlet-url to create an actionURL in JS... is there a way to "fire" it, or do I have to use window.location.href=actionURL.toString()?
14:22 <@jhf:#liferay> I suppose you could assign it to a button and then fire some JS event to trigger the button.. but location.href is probably easier.
14:23 < jardineworks:#liferay> ok cool... just wasn;t sure if there was another jas util that I should be using to invoke the urls.
22:41 < darkos:#liferay> hey @jhf thank you for creating that issue report.  I kinda got sidetracked.
23:32 < AdminInNeed:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur: hey, it's worth a try; have a great weekend.
