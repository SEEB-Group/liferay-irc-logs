04:42 < hufg:#liferay> any ideas how replicating lucene indexes across the cluster works?
04:43 < hufg:#liferay> what if one node is down and no reindex on startup
04:43 < hufg:#liferay> does it poll the cluster for newest indexes
04:43 < hufg:#liferay> shutdown one node for 1 week start without reindex on startup and what happens?
04:46 < hufg:#liferay> topolik ? 8)
04:46 < topolik:#liferay> hi hufg
04:46 < topolik:#liferay> I'm sorry, I knew that but I forgot :D
04:47 < topolik:#liferay> there are 2 ways - the cluster sends only incremental changes or when new instance shows it sends everything
04:47 < topolik:#liferay> but I'm not able to remember what's the right one :)
05:37 < spandana:#liferay> hi..am getting the following error while running a spring portlet hibernate application..can you please help me..The error i got is Initial SessionFactory creation failed.java.lang.IncompatibleClassChangeError: Implementing class
07:19 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik, hufg I'm not sure about the latest versions but I know that I had a problem for a client once on 5.2.3 around this. He had some shit code that caused the servers to crash every 15 minutes, so they were constantly restarting themselves. In fact the sysadmin had a script that would restart them every 10 minutes before they had a chance to crash. Anyway, one of the main issues was his search indices were always out of whack.
07:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> ... so I would have guessed incremental changes for that version at least.
08:14 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Hey guys...has anyone of you ever experienced that Web Content Articles immediately go live despite staging being activated?
08:14 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> We have some serious issues with that at the moment, because the content people try to prepare some updates and they show up on live immediately.
