07:29 < hufg:#liferay> helloo helloo
09:18 < hufg:#liferay> has anyone ever removed dynamiccssfilter successfully?
09:54 < hufg:#liferay> whats up
09:54 <@jhf:#liferay> hey hufg
09:55 <@jhf:#liferay> isn't there a portal properties to disable the dynamiccssfilter?
09:55 < hufg:#liferay> jhf: yes but you will  wreck a lot of things in the process
09:56 <@jhf:#liferay> also - in 5 minutes we will be doing a drawing for the last quarter's top contributors https://www.liferay.com/community/special-projects/top-contributor-awards-2013
09:56 <@jhf:#liferay> winners get either a free training seat at an upcoming Liferay training class, a free ticket to an upcoming conference, or a USD 200 gift card (or its equivalent in local currency)
09:56 <@jhf:#liferay> checking on dynamiccssfilter
09:58 < hufg:#liferay> you will wreck parent themes css, combo servlet, internal css(?), journal
09:58 < hufg:#liferay> woops internal css journal etcv(?)
09:58 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah, apparently it wrecks anything that uses the OOTB themes, since they rely on sass (according to Mika - https://www.liferay.com/community/forums/-/message_boards/message/16130226)
10:01 <@jhf:#liferay> I'm reading an internal report and it confirms its not possible to disable, unless you write a custom theme for control panel
10:01 <@jhf:#liferay> JanHajovsky !!
10:02 <@jhf:#liferay> usually we have jardineworks on but he must be busy (working on some project) - also I think dhrutika will show up (I hope)
10:04 < JanHajovsky:#liferay> Hi all!
10:04 <@jhf:#liferay> and we have jardineworks now too :)
10:04 <@jhf:#liferay> wonder if dhrutika will show up
10:05 <@jhf:#liferay> so because we're nerds, and want to play fair, I am going to generate a string that enumerates the contestants, generate an SHA-1 hash of it, then ask someone to pick a winner, and then confirm the winner by revealing the string so everyone can see what the order was of the contestents
10:05 < jardineworks:#liferay> good morning guys
10:06 <@jhf:#liferay> ok jardineworks JanHajovsky ready?
10:07 < jardineworks:#liferay> giver
10:07 <@jhf:#liferay> ok the SHA-1 hash of the list of contestants is b06fb2466c3db0c4f2ee0e100e2dcb0cae3012cc
10:07 < JanHajovsky:#liferay> jhf sure, sounds great!
10:08 <@jhf:#liferay> soooooooo... I'll ask JanHajovsky to pick a number: 1, 2, or 3 to determine the winner
10:08 < jardineworks:#liferay> good luck JanHajovsky
10:08 < jardineworks:#liferay> :)
10:08 < JanHajovsky:#liferay> number one is always winner
10:08 < JanHajovsky:#liferay> :)
10:08 < jardineworks:#liferay> haha
10:08 <@jhf:#liferay> ok number 1 - final answer?
10:08 < JanHajovsky:#liferay> yes
10:08 <@jhf:#liferay> ok the winner is...................
10:09 <@jhf:#liferay> wait for it................
10:09 <@jhf:#liferay> jardineworks !!!!! you've won the grand prize!!
10:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> :O
10:09 <@jhf:#liferay> the string was "jardineworks=1,dhrutika=2,janhajovsky=3 and this sentence is so you can't guess it"
10:09 < jardineworks:#liferay> \o/
10:09 <@jhf:#liferay> [jhf@jamesfabpupdate]:tmp$> echo "jardineworks=1,dhrutika=2,janhajovsky=3 and this sentence is so you can't guess it" | openssl sha1
10:09 <@jhf:#liferay> (stdin)= b06fb2466c3db0c4f2ee0e100e2dcb0cae3012cc
10:09 <@jhf:#liferay> if you run that you should get the same.
10:10 <@jhf:#liferay> dang.. you know, I guess there's still a chance to cheat, if I'd given the string to jan privately
10:10 <@jhf:#liferay> hmmm
10:10 <@jhf:#liferay> will have to think about that.
10:10 < JanHajovsky:#liferay> congratulation jardineworks, you deserve it!
10:10 <@jhf:#liferay> ok jardineworks you can think about which prize option you wish to receive and let me know whenever.
10:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> thanks Jan!
10:11 <@jhf:#liferay> and thanks to you all (and everyone here) for your contributions
10:11 < JanHajovsky:#liferay> anytime
