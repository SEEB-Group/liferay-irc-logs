03:40 < hufg:#liferay> wazap hows it hanging
04:34 < Axxell:#liferay> topolik: found the problem with assets not showing in the assetpublisher, where the assets had changed categoryids from my portlet... the problem was indexing, apparently AP only looks in the index so allthough everything was right, the assets would not show right away. Used AssetEntryLocalServiceUtil.reindex which did the trick
08:35 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey topolik you there?
08:35 < Yam`:#liferay> hey
08:43 < Yam`:#liferay> Why do I have to restart the server for each js change? :/
08:45 < jardineworks:#liferay> Yam`, you shouldn't have to
08:45 < Yam`:#liferay> I've defined my js file in liferay-portlet.xml with <footer-portlet-javascript>/js/rooms.js</footer-portlet-javascript> but each time I change rooms.js the change isn't working until I restart the server
08:45 < Yam`:#liferay> I just deploy my portlet project but it's not working
