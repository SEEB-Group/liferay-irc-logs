03:40 < hufg:#liferay> wazap hows it hanging
04:34 < Axxell:#liferay> topolik: found the problem with assets not showing in the assetpublisher, where the assets had changed categoryids from my portlet... the problem was indexing, apparently AP only looks in the index so allthough everything was right, the assets would not show right away. Used AssetEntryLocalServiceUtil.reindex which did the trick
08:35 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey topolik you there?
08:35 < Yam`:#liferay> hey
08:43 < Yam`:#liferay> Why do I have to restart the server for each js change? :/
08:45 < jardineworks:#liferay> Yam`, you shouldn't have to
08:45 < Yam`:#liferay> I've defined my js file in liferay-portlet.xml with <footer-portlet-javascript>/js/rooms.js</footer-portlet-javascript> but each time I change rooms.js the change isn't working until I restart the server
08:45 < Yam`:#liferay> I just deploy my portlet project but it's not working
08:46 < hufg:#liferay> cache
08:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> Yam`,  --
08:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> ## ---------------------------------------------------------------------
08:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> ## Settings for theme development
08:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> ##
08:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> 	theme.css.fast.load=false
08:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> 	javascript.fast.load=false
08:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> 	javascript.log.enabled=false

08:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> 	velocity.engine.resource.manager.cache.enabled=false
08:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> Yam`, and make sure you disable the caching in your browser too
08:48 < Yam`:#liferay> where do I change that jardineworks ?
08:48 < jardineworks:#liferay> Yam`, portal-ext.properties
08:48 < jardineworks:#liferay> and restart
08:48 < hufg:#liferay> cache plugins are pretty neat for ff and chrome
08:48 < jardineworks:#liferay> hufg, good point
08:49 < jardineworks:#liferay> better to use one of those than to disable it altogether :)
08:49 < Yam`:#liferay> a ctrl + f5 would do it, no?
08:49 < hufg:#liferay> in ff chrome ctrl+shift r i guess
08:50 < Yam`:#liferay> or may be both
08:50 < hufg:#liferay> cache enable/disable plugin is the way to go
08:50 < hufg:#liferay> easy work!
08:50 < Yam`:#liferay> a plugin to advise?
08:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> Yam`, there are tons of them -- any will do :)
08:51 < hufg:#liferay> yeah
08:51 < Yam`:#liferay> ok!
08:51 < hufg:#liferay> jardineworks: hows it going? still trucking along with lfieray?
08:52 < Yam`:#liferay> do I need to restart the server after changing portal-ext-properties?
08:52 < jardineworks:#liferay> Yam`, yep
08:52 < jardineworks:#liferay> hufg, \o/!
08:53 < Yam`:#liferay> ty :)
08:53 < jardineworks:#liferay> back from service?
08:53 < hufg:#liferay> naah 4.5months to go
08:53 < jardineworks:#liferay> boo!
08:53 < hufg:#liferay> hehe honestly it's pretty great 8)
08:53 < jardineworks:#liferay> yeah I am still trunkin' with LR. New client... lots of crazy shit they want to do ... fighting with Maven (kill me).
08:54 < hufg:#liferay> cmon why fight with maven...peace man
08:54 < jardineworks:#liferay> oh yeah, it was the end of the year when you started right? or right at the beginning of the new year
08:54 < jardineworks:#liferay> lol
08:54 < hufg:#liferay> beginning of the new year
08:54 < jardineworks:#liferay> ant = been around forever always works. maven (for lr) is still newish and buggy
08:55 < hufg:#liferay> building lr or maven plugins?
08:55 < jardineworks:#liferay> right now though I have an AWESOME situation. I have an EXT plugin that won't deploy ... well, it deploys, BUT my overriding class is not being seen or pushed in place of the OOTB class.
08:55 < jardineworks:#liferay> really starting to piss me off.
08:56 < hufg:#liferay> maven lr plugins i mean
08:56 < jardineworks:#liferay> yeah ... maven lr plugins
08:57 < hufg:#liferay> which ones?
08:57 < hufg:#liferay> we had some trouble with theme plugin build-css option but the rest seemed alright
08:59 < jardineworks:#liferay> hufg, for me its the ext
08:59 < hufg:#liferay> mm
09:00 < jardineworks:#liferay> hufg, the *-ext.xml file in the ROOT/WEB-INF folder, for starters, doesn't have my class listed in the <files/> node
09:03 < jardineworks:#liferay> hufg, some suspicious output when I build -- check it out http://pastebin.com/XjXdAPf0
09:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> right now I am just trying to get one class in the ext-impl to go out (for the moment)
09:05 < hufg:#liferay> paste tree project-dir and pom.xml
09:07 < hufg:#liferay> don't really have a clue but you don't really need to use the lr plugin for ext-hook?
09:08 < hufg:#liferay> for example theme plugin is mandatory to overlay the parent theme which would be tedious otherwise
09:09 < hufg:#liferay> to overlay the parent theme into the actual theme
09:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> hufg, in my case I tried to do this with regular hooks but the changes I need to make run so deep that its just way easier to do it with an EXT. I am changing the EditInstanceAction for example .. I hooked the action to do most of what I wanted but one of the things you need to do when you create a new instance is PortalInstances.initCompany() which does all sorts of important stuff. I don;t have access to that class in the ho
09:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> ok (its a portal-impl class) and the stuff it does I don't want to try to reproduce manually.
09:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> one sec... I'll show you the pom and dir.
09:13 < jardineworks:#liferay> http://pastebin.com/ciAp69ga
09:22 < hufg:#liferay> :Z
09:26 < hufg:#liferay> ahh no clue 8)
09:28 < hufg:#liferay> but perhaps create the simplest possible hook for example to override/copy portal-ext.properties
09:31 < hufg:#liferay> or find a working ext plugin and compare
09:31 < hufg:#liferay> this kind of stuff is pretty tedious because the maven plugin can do something retarded or you have made some configuration etc error :Z
09:43 < jardineworks:#liferay> argh
09:58 < Yam`:#liferay> what is profiling mode?
10:08 < jardineworks:#liferay> wow -- it just gets better. I undeployed the ext plugin. Then redeployed it... and not the <files/> list includes my class. Shutdown the server and start it back up only to have a calss not found error for PropsUtil... which is a class that I have not changed and should be found in the defacto portal-impl.jar
10:08 < jardineworks:#liferay> F A I L
10:18 < ArTeS:#liferay> it is not fail this is fail:

10:56 < dawn:#liferay> bijoo_: hi there
10:58 < dawn:#liferay> bijoo: i was trying to make LR as SAML IDP and having difficulty in sending attributes in SAML authentication response to SP.
10:59 < dawn:#liferay> bijoo: here is what i followed http://www.liferay.com/web/mika.koivisto/blog/-/blogs/getting-started-with-liferay-saml-2-0-identity-provider...
11:00 < dawn:#liferay> bijoo: any idea how to release attributes to SP?
11:32 -!- mode/#liferay [+o jhf] by ChanServ
11:41 < dawn:#liferay> hi jhf
11:42 < dawn:#liferay> jhf: have a question about LR as SAML IDP
11:42 <@jhf:#liferay> ok, but I’ve never used SAML :(
11:42 < dawn:#liferay> jhf: i was trying to make LR as SAML IDP and having difficulty in sending attributes in SAML authentication response to SP.
11:43 < dawn:#liferay> jhf: may be this is the time to try :)
11:44 < dawn:#liferay> bijoo: here is what i followed https://www.liferay.com/group/customer/knowledge/kb/-/knowledge_base/article/14061756
11:44 < dawn:#liferay> jhf: here is what i followed https://www.liferay.com/group/customer/knowledge/kb/-/knowledge_base/article/14061756
11:46 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah.. sorry, I don’t have time now to install and learn SAML and help :( have you tried posting to our forums?
11:46 <@jhf:#liferay> or perhaps someone with some SAML knowledge here can help
11:47 < dawn:#liferay> jhf: that is fine...i have seen a similar post with slightly different issue in forums http://www.liferay.com/community/forums/-/message_boards/message/41085190 which is unanswered, so thought to ask here
13:26 < Bryanstein:#liferay> is the community manager in here?
13:56 -!- mode/#liferay [+o jhf] by ChanServ
14:25 < Bryanstein:#liferay> jhf, ping
16:42 < bijoo_:#liferay> dawn: I'm in same boat as jhf here; but have you tried setting the properties? Which SP attributes trying to set? Have you seen the following post as well? https://www.liferay.com/community/forums/-/message_boards/message/28886644
16:47 < dawn:#liferay> bijoo_: thank you..will take a look
16:53 < bijoo_:#liferay> dawn: sure and one other way is to debug; I'd be happy to help you with that step.
16:54 < bijoo_:#liferay> dawn: that is if you have the env setup there; easiest way is to just step through code; often beats trying to guess what happened.
16:55 < dawn:#liferay> bijoo_: i did take a look at the code and found that the entity id is a string and should match exactly
16:55 < dawn:#liferay> bijoo_: i missed a "/" at the end :(
20:16 < gogamoga:#liferay> https://gist.github.com/gogamoga/060f306029ce0080acf2
20:16 < gogamoga:#liferay> fucking 10 hours of hacking to produce this shit
20:22 < bijoo_:#liferay> gogamoga: that sucks; next time it'll take you less time though :)
20:22 < gogamoga:#liferay> there will be no next time :P
20:23 < gogamoga:#liferay> i finally got my json feeds without touching serviceLocator settings
20:23 < gogamoga:#liferay> crazy requirements here
20:24 < bijoo_:#liferay> gogamoga: I once sepnt 3 days on SSO bug; collaborrated with folks over world (the phillipines and some other places) ; ended up needed to restart Windows (deleting hidden Cookies not enough)
20:24 < gogamoga:#liferay> theres a certain company that builds their shit on liferay, and the company i work for is the client for that platform
20:25 < gogamoga:#liferay> now... i can do whatever i want, but! 1. no access to server in no way, only what portal offers
20:25 < gogamoga:#liferay> 2. no plugin isntallations
20:25 < gogamoga:#liferay> 3. no touching server config (which means no serviceLocator)
20:25 < bijoo_:#liferay> gogamoga: hmmm, and you're supposed to do what with that?
20:25 < gogamoga:#liferay> implement alternative CMS UI
20:26 < gogamoga:#liferay> :P
20:26 < gogamoga:#liferay> SPA, all restful
20:26 < bijoo_:#liferay> gogamoga: that's a challenge since can't deploy plugins
20:26 < bijoo_:#liferay> gogamoga: usually can use a hook to do that
20:26 < gogamoga:#liferay> well the hardest part is over
20:26 < gogamoga:#liferay> 4. no hooks :P
20:26 < bijoo_:#liferay> gogamoga: are you using all web content here?
20:26 < gogamoga:#liferay> yep
20:26 < bijoo_:#liferay> gogamoga: wow, I see now, all are templates here
20:27 < bijoo_:#liferay> structures and templates to make the whole thing
20:27 < gogamoga:#liferay> basically, all that is at my disposal is structures, templates, and ddl
20:27 < gogamoga:#liferay> so i need to implement json gateway in velocity omg
20:27 < bijoo_:#liferay> gogamoga: yes, rest is really the convenience
20:28 < gogamoga:#liferay> which is missing from liferay (default installation)
20:28 < bijoo_:#liferay> gogamoga: pretty tough constraints and interesting
20:28 < gogamoga:#liferay> the hardest part was reaching java classes without service locator
20:29 < bijoo_:#liferay> gogamoga: well seems using the class loader here
20:29 < gogamoga:#liferay> yeah, at least this works
20:29 < gogamoga:#liferay> and imho, it only works because the [Provider] company has no clue about it :P
20:29 < gogamoga:#liferay> otherwise they would block it too
20:30 < gogamoga:#liferay> the reason i am going through all that shit, is because liferay translation tactics suck
20:30 < gogamoga:#liferay> (at the current understanding level of lazy CMS team)
20:30 < bijoo_:#liferay> gogamoga: hmm, sounds pretty restrictive and weird there
20:30 < bijoo_:#liferay> gogamoga: you on some DoD proj or something?
20:30 < gogamoga:#liferay> all they do is create web content without template/structure (basically just copy paste into rich editor)
20:30 < gogamoga:#liferay> and then clone this for every language
20:31 < gogamoga:#liferay> and then when they need to adjust a class or some other value on elements they repeat the task for every locale
20:31 < gogamoga:#liferay> about 15 times :P
20:31 < gogamoga:#liferay> close lol
20:31 < gogamoga:#liferay> williamhill
20:31 < gogamoga:#liferay> :P
20:31 < bijoo_:#liferay> gogamoga: hmm, you running on which version LR?
20:31 < gogamoga:#liferay> 6.1
20:31 < gogamoga:#liferay> ce
20:32 < bijoo_:#liferay> gogamoga: haha, I see, yea, I can see, finance
20:32 < gogamoga:#liferay> everything is locked down
20:32 < gogamoga:#liferay> also, liferay docs are really poor
20:33 < gogamoga:#liferay> if i hadnt my 17 years of reversing i wouldnt be able to even think where to start
20:33 < bijoo_:#liferay> gogamoga: 6.2 better translation support
20:33 < gogamoga:#liferay> heh, 6.2 is scheduled for next year
20:33 < gogamoga:#liferay> which means in 3 years at least
20:34 < gogamoga:#liferay> so... i am going to implement my own translation system
20:34 < gogamoga:#liferay> strings in ddl
20:34 < gogamoga:#liferay> string groups in ddl
20:34 < bijoo_:#liferay> gogamoga: haha; here's my take on Liferay Docs: use the official Liferay In Action; otherwise need to go through ton of code (which is what I do just to be safe side)
20:34 < gogamoga:#liferay> well, i went through code
20:35 < gogamoga:#liferay> the book is useless for me, cause i have no means to touch the java side
20:35 < gogamoga:#liferay> only javascript is available here
20:35 < gogamoga:#liferay> gonna make UI in angular that talks to my json gateways
20:36 < gogamoga:#liferay> kind of extra layer on top of liferay
20:36 < gogamoga:#liferay> jade for templates, stylus for css
20:36 < gogamoga:#liferay> everything is stored in documents and media
20:36 < gogamoga:#liferay> and when the CMS dudes make new web content, the UI will compile it into the form that they are used to
20:37 < bijoo_:#liferay> gogamoga: the JS Service API's okay; of course it is missing quite few methods
20:37 < gogamoga:#liferay> aka: no templates and no structures just chunks of markup into templates
20:37 < gogamoga:#liferay> js service api is partial
20:37 < gogamoga:#liferay> i was like WTF where is the method to pull all the records
20:37 < gogamoga:#liferay> you can add records, remove records but not list them lol
20:38 < gogamoga:#liferay> also, there are additional limitations to this shit
20:38 < gogamoga:#liferay> the UI has to be firefox addon on top of everything :P
20:39 < gogamoga:#liferay> user has to log into the liferay with admin priveleges, then firefox addon grabs the session and continues from there
20:39 < bijoo_:#liferay> gogamoga: wow, really unique requirements there
20:39 < gogamoga:#liferay> because there are extra auth on the way
20:39 < gogamoga:#liferay> worst thing, i cant share any code with anyone lol
20:40 < gogamoga:#liferay> thats why the ui has to be standalone
20:40 < gogamoga:#liferay> so the provider company wont get its hands on it
20:40 < gogamoga:#liferay> they have full access to staging
20:40 < gogamoga:#liferay> dirty politics
20:41 < bijoo_:#liferay> gogamoga: I used to work in secure env before; one day coworker shows up and tells me : "What do you think you're doing?" (I had my cell phone charging from laptop USB) "What's wrong, I said?" He said "Personal property can't be attached to company laptops." "Fire me" I said; I quite there a few months later (go figure)
20:41 < gogamoga:#liferay> heh
20:41 < bijoo_:#liferay> quit*
20:42 < gogamoga:#liferay> i cant bring my laptop to work :P
20:42 < gogamoga:#liferay> well i can, but i cant turn it on :P
20:42 < bijoo_:#liferay> gogamoga: yes, at least Liferay aint hurt you too bad; at least, the code is there for reference
20:43 < gogamoga:#liferay> liferay is uber popular with third world countries for some reason
20:43 < gogamoga:#liferay> i prefer nodejs myself
20:43 < bijoo_:#liferay> gogamoga: since saves time of reversing the auth mech.
20:44 < bijoo_:#liferay> gogamoga: lots of choices; I like Liferay a lot. It hasn't done me wrong in 5 years now.
20:45 < gogamoga:#liferay> imho, too heavy
20:45 < gogamoga:#liferay> tries to fit every task at hand
20:45 < bijoo_:#liferay> gogamoga: yes, know; they're going to OSGi. So in 7 should be more modular.
20:45 < gogamoga:#liferay> i prefer running mutliple vpss and clustering them together
20:46 < bijoo_:#liferay> gogamoga: though with current can turn anything off.
20:46 < gogamoga:#liferay> heh
20:46 < gogamoga:#liferay> if you are in favourable conditions
20:47 < bijoo_:#liferay> gogamoga: haha, true; these are unique conditions.
20:47 < gogamoga:#liferay> i am in hell here, no touching nothing or death penalty
20:47 < bijoo_:#liferay> gogamoga: do you have access to admin account?
20:47 < gogamoga:#liferay> nope
20:47 < gogamoga:#liferay> cant even schedule publishing
20:47 < bijoo_:#liferay> gogamoga: wow, they've really given hard time here.
20:47 < gogamoga:#liferay> though technically i can do anything with class lookup
20:48 < gogamoga:#liferay> but if they find out it wont be fun
20:48 < bijoo_:#liferay> gogamoga: haha, you can do anything with that.
20:48 < bijoo_:#liferay> gogamoga: you could write your own shell exec process.
20:48 < bijoo_:#liferay> java.lang.ProcessBuilder
20:48 < gogamoga:#liferay> actually thats one hell of security flaw
20:48 < bijoo_:#liferay> gogamoga: unless they are running in secure mode
20:49 < gogamoga:#liferay> simple template can rape the whole portal
20:49 < bijoo_:#liferay> gogamoga: well not if the server's configured right
20:49 < gogamoga:#liferay> 100% guaranteed server is at its out of the box settings
20:50 < gogamoga:#liferay> imho, ddl is very powerfull feature which is underdeveloped
20:50 < bijoo_:#liferay> gogamoga: yes, so OOB means really exposed; so I guess you have *some* access here
20:50 < gogamoga:#liferay> at least with the components that come out of the box
20:51 < gogamoga:#liferay> theres no bridge (no easy bridge) between web-content and ddl
20:51 < gogamoga:#liferay> so basically this is what i am making here
20:51 < bijoo_:#liferay> gogamoga: yes DDL's underrated right now; many places that it can be applied. Personally, I've only used few times; since DDLs have learning curve to them; but service builder has a lower curve.
20:51 < gogamoga:#liferay> perfomance question now
20:52 < bijoo_:#liferay> gogamoga: so a set of Utils to bridge that gap
20:52 < gogamoga:#liferay> if i make vm templates which pull data out of ddl, will it impact perfomance (if i tick cached)
20:53 < bijoo_:#liferay> gogamoga: no it shouldn't since DDL is cached; so context won't affect the performance
20:53 < bijoo_:#liferay> gogamoga: whether calling from a VM or not.
20:53 < gogamoga:#liferay> hmm, let me ask it this way: each time liferay wants to render web-content, (cached one)
20:53 < gogamoga:#liferay> will it go and query the ddl or it will use cached render?
20:55 < bijoo_:#liferay> gogamoga: even with cache should query DDL; but DDL util should have cache hit;
20:55 < bijoo_:#liferay> gogamoga: which is what should happen with anything; unless the template is only static.
20:55 < gogamoga:#liferay> ok, this might save me some pain
20:55 < gogamoga:#liferay> well, its 4am
20:56 < gogamoga:#liferay> and i gotta go to work in 5 hours
20:56 < gogamoga:#liferay> nice talking to you :P
20:56 < bijoo_:#liferay> gogamoga: haha, later, good luck on the project
21:49 < aelnattar:#liferay> hey guys
