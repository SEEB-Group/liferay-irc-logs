03:40 < hufg:#liferay> wazap hows it hanging
04:34 < Axxell:#liferay> topolik: found the problem with assets not showing in the assetpublisher, where the assets had changed categoryids from my portlet... the problem was indexing, apparently AP only looks in the index so allthough everything was right, the assets would not show right away. Used AssetEntryLocalServiceUtil.reindex which did the trick
08:35 < jardineworks:#liferay> hey topolik you there?
08:35 < Yam`:#liferay> hey
08:43 < Yam`:#liferay> Why do I have to restart the server for each js change? :/
08:45 < jardineworks:#liferay> Yam`, you shouldn't have to
08:45 < Yam`:#liferay> I've defined my js file in liferay-portlet.xml with <footer-portlet-javascript>/js/rooms.js</footer-portlet-javascript> but each time I change rooms.js the change isn't working until I restart the server
08:45 < Yam`:#liferay> I just deploy my portlet project but it's not working
08:46 < hufg:#liferay> cache
08:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> Yam`,  --
08:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> ## ---------------------------------------------------------------------
08:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> ## Settings for theme development

08:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> Yam`, and make sure you disable the caching in your browser too
08:48 < Yam`:#liferay> where do I change that jardineworks ?
08:48 < jardineworks:#liferay> Yam`, portal-ext.properties
08:48 < jardineworks:#liferay> and restart
08:48 < hufg:#liferay> cache plugins are pretty neat for ff and chrome
08:48 < jardineworks:#liferay> hufg, good point
08:49 < jardineworks:#liferay> better to use one of those than to disable it altogether :)
08:49 < Yam`:#liferay> a ctrl + f5 would do it, no?
08:49 < hufg:#liferay> in ff chrome ctrl+shift r i guess
08:50 < Yam`:#liferay> or may be both
08:50 < hufg:#liferay> cache enable/disable plugin is the way to go
08:50 < hufg:#liferay> easy work!
08:50 < Yam`:#liferay> a plugin to advise?
08:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> Yam`, there are tons of them -- any will do :)
08:51 < hufg:#liferay> yeah
08:51 < Yam`:#liferay> ok!
08:51 < hufg:#liferay> jardineworks: hows it going? still trucking along with lfieray?
08:52 < Yam`:#liferay> do I need to restart the server after changing portal-ext-properties?
08:52 < jardineworks:#liferay> Yam`, yep
08:52 < jardineworks:#liferay> hufg, \o/!
08:53 < Yam`:#liferay> ty :)
08:53 < jardineworks:#liferay> back from service?
08:53 < hufg:#liferay> naah 4.5months to go
08:53 < jardineworks:#liferay> boo!
08:53 < hufg:#liferay> hehe honestly it's pretty great 8)
08:53 < jardineworks:#liferay> yeah I am still trunkin' with LR. New client... lots of crazy shit they want to do ... fighting with Maven (kill me).
08:54 < hufg:#liferay> cmon why fight with maven...peace man
08:54 < jardineworks:#liferay> oh yeah, it was the end of the year when you started right? or right at the beginning of the new year
08:54 < jardineworks:#liferay> lol
08:54 < hufg:#liferay> beginning of the new year
08:54 < jardineworks:#liferay> ant = been around forever always works. maven (for lr) is still newish and buggy
08:55 < hufg:#liferay> building lr or maven plugins?
08:55 < jardineworks:#liferay> right now though I have an AWESOME situation. I have an EXT plugin that won't deploy ... well, it deploys, BUT my overriding class is not being seen or pushed in place of the OOTB class.
08:55 < jardineworks:#liferay> really starting to piss me off.
08:56 < hufg:#liferay> maven lr plugins i mean
08:56 < jardineworks:#liferay> yeah ... maven lr plugins
08:57 < hufg:#liferay> which ones?
08:57 < hufg:#liferay> we had some trouble with theme plugin build-css option but the rest seemed alright
08:59 < jardineworks:#liferay> hufg, for me its the ext
08:59 < hufg:#liferay> mm
09:00 < jardineworks:#liferay> hufg, the *-ext.xml file in the ROOT/WEB-INF folder, for starters, doesn't have my class listed in the <files/> node
09:03 < jardineworks:#liferay> hufg, some suspicious output when I build -- check it out http://pastebin.com/XjXdAPf0
09:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> right now I am just trying to get one class in the ext-impl to go out (for the moment)
09:05 < hufg:#liferay> paste tree project-dir and pom.xml
09:07 < hufg:#liferay> don't really have a clue but you don't really need to use the lr plugin for ext-hook?
09:08 < hufg:#liferay> for example theme plugin is mandatory to overlay the parent theme which would be tedious otherwise
09:09 < hufg:#liferay> to overlay the parent theme into the actual theme
09:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> hufg, in my case I tried to do this with regular hooks but the changes I need to make run so deep that its just way easier to do it with an EXT. I am changing the EditInstanceAction for example .. I hooked the action to do most of what I wanted but one of the things you need to do when you create a new instance is PortalInstances.initCompany() which does all sorts of important stuff. I don;t have access to that class in the ho
09:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> ok (its a portal-impl class) and the stuff it does I don't want to try to reproduce manually.
09:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> one sec... I'll show you the pom and dir.
09:13 < jardineworks:#liferay> http://pastebin.com/ciAp69ga
09:22 < hufg:#liferay> :Z
09:26 < hufg:#liferay> ahh no clue 8)
09:28 < hufg:#liferay> but perhaps create the simplest possible hook for example to override/copy portal-ext.properties
09:31 < hufg:#liferay> or find a working ext plugin and compare
09:31 < hufg:#liferay> this kind of stuff is pretty tedious because the maven plugin can do something retarded or you have made some configuration etc error :Z
09:43 < jardineworks:#liferay> argh
09:58 < Yam`:#liferay> what is profiling mode?
10:08 < jardineworks:#liferay> wow -- it just gets better. I undeployed the ext plugin. Then redeployed it... and not the <files/> list includes my class. Shutdown the server and start it back up only to have a calss not found error for PropsUtil... which is a class that I have not changed and should be found in the defacto portal-impl.jar
10:08 < jardineworks:#liferay> F A I L
10:18 < ArTeS:#liferay> it is not fail this is fail:
