00:16 < bradley:#liferay> does anyone know in velocity how when clicked to set a layout for the page
01:03 < Ababab:#liferay> Hi. Any ideas why my Liferay is suddenly running very slowly. I was on 6.1GA2 when this started, but I upgraded to GA3 to see if the problems would disappear. Something must have updated itself I guess.. If I take a thread dump, a thread called RubyExecutor is doing lot of work all the time
04:15 < w4l:#liferay> does anyone know to apply a bootstrap theme to liferay 6.2?
04:16 < w4l:#liferay> I got a nice theme and I need to install to liferay, but can't find how to install
04:16 < w4l:#liferay> appreciate ur help
04:20 < bjornjohansson_:#liferay> I think you can put the themes war-file directly under the deploy-folder
05:07 < Axxell:#liferay> Hey guys, just realied
05:07 < Axxell:#liferay> *Hey guys, just realised that liferay 6.2 has a welcome page.. that i seem to be unable to delete... it does not have the normal editing options as other pages have
05:11 < Axxell:#liferay> Is this normal? Havent seen this in any older versions of liferay, what could the problem be? How do i fix it?
