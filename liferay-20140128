01:03 < Ababab:#liferay> Hi. Any ideas why my Liferay is suddenly running very slowly. I was on 6.1GA2 when this started, but I upgraded to GA3 to see if the problems would disappear. Something must have updated itself I guess.. If I take a thread dump, a thread called RubyExecutor is doing lot of work all the time

04:16 < w4l:#liferay> I got a nice theme and I need to install to liferay, but can't find how to install
04:16 < w4l:#liferay> appreciate ur help

05:41 < Axxell:#liferay> apparently this is an open issue, can be resolved by updating db by hand https://www.liferay.com/community/forums/-/message_boards/message/32478430
