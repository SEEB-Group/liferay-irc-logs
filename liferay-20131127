06:18 < hufg:#liferay> is there a token to display article id in content template
06:32 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> It should be somwhere in the request, shouldn't it?
06:32 < hufg:#liferay> hmm
06:32 < hufg:#liferay> i want to show article id in web content
06:32 < hufg:#liferay> ie. create article -> put article on page -> it shows the article id
06:33 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I would assume that you have to extract it from the request.
06:34 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> $request should be available in a template.
06:35 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> There is also $layout I think, which might contain the information as well, but I'm not sure.
06:36 < hufg:#liferay> it's not there
06:36 < hufg:#liferay> but the enclosing div from web content display has it
06:36 < hufg:#liferay> <div id="article_10156_10556_127512_1.0" class="journal-content-article">
06:36 < hufg:#liferay> which is just as fine
06:37 < hufg:#liferay> just needs some more jquery trickery
06:38 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Nasty.
06:39 < hufg:#liferay> ahh no it's not fine
06:39 < hufg:#liferay> that will not do
06:39 < hufg:#liferay> it needs to be in article content
06:42 < hufg:#liferay> and it needs to come easily hehe ie. no complex db queries or anything like that
06:44 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Hm. But there has to be some request data available.
06:44 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Worst case: $xmlRequest
06:47 < hufg:#liferay> yeah but it's not guaranteed it contains the article id
