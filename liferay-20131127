06:18 < hufg:#liferay> is there a token to display article id in content template
06:32 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> It should be somwhere in the request, shouldn't it?
06:32 < hufg:#liferay> hmm
06:32 < hufg:#liferay> i want to show article id in web content
06:32 < hufg:#liferay> ie. create article -> put article on page -> it shows the article id
06:33 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I would assume that you have to extract it from the request.
06:34 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> $request should be available in a template.
