01:06 < jrmiah:#liferay> has anyone any guides on how to build liferay from github? Just need to build and produce a WAR and any configuration for tomcat if required - thanks
03:27 < rocknroll_:#liferay> hey all, when commenting on a calendar event, there is an email notification sent. where is this notification and it's content defiend? iot is not localized
09:21 < jardineworks:#liferay> jrmiah, keep an eye out for jhf ... he has a recipe for how to build from github. He gave it to me once, lemme see if I can find it for now.

09:26 < goku_:#liferay> hi ,how to create a RestrictionFactoryUtil to check between two date ?
09:26 < jardineworks:#liferay> jrmiah, sorry -- can't find it -- which makes me sad because I had plans to use it as well.

09:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, ! \o/
09:47 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, remember when you shared with me a recipe for how to build the portal from github?
09:47 <@jhf:#liferay> yah...
09:47 < jardineworks:#liferay> i lost it :(
09:47 < jardineworks:#liferay> can you share again? jrmiah was asking about it and when I went to look for it, could not be found
09:48 <@jhf:#liferay> you mean the “build portal and plugins manually” here: https://www.liferay.com/community/wiki/-/wiki/Main/BugSquad+-+Liferay+Portal+6.2+CE+Milestone+6+Testing#section-BugSquad+-+Liferay+Portal+6.2+CE+Milestone+6+Testing-Building+Portal+and+Plugins+Manually
09:50 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, that will probably do --- but I think you gave me some kinda personal version. Though maybe you were just copying from this :)
09:50 <@jhf:#liferay> hah probably :) you’ll need to replace the names of the directories and such..
09:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> and you had something about ant... you had to pass a jvm arg for more mem or soemthing.
10:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo_, do you use ANT of Maven for your plugins?

11:00 < jardineworks:#liferay> maven is stupid.

11:07 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, do you ever do anything with Maven and LR?
11:08 < jardineworks:#liferay> Maven makes me want to put gun in my mouth.
11:08 <@jhf:#liferay> hah.. well, the best thing (IMO) about Maven+Liferay is that you no longer need to use the Plugins SDK :)
11:08 <@jhf:#liferay> but yeah I’ve recently begun using it in my projects
11:10 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, I am trying to get an external database service builder project to work with Maven and I can't It's refusing to deploy the portlet because the 1.0.0 SNAPSHOT is older than the 6.2.10 version ... which of course I only discovered by upping the output on the Deployment classes. Do you know how to get around this?
11:11 < jardineworks:#liferay> shouldn't it be referencing the service.properties file?
11:14 <@jhf:#liferay> you can try to un-deploy the 6.2.10 version (i.e. rm -rf tomcat-xx.xx.xx/webapps/my-sb-portlet)
11:14 <@jhf:#liferay> and then deploy the 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT
11:17 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, I'll try again but I did that ... I still see this
11:17 < jardineworks:#liferay> 15:14:28,570 INFO  [com.liferay.portal.kernel.deploy.auto.AutoDeployScanner][BaseDeployer:962] Updating sample-sb-external-db from version 6.2.10 to version 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT

11:20 <@jhf:#liferay> are you sure you’re deleting all of the deployed webapps? do you by chance have 2 deployments (from the perspective of tomcat)? i.e. something like webapps/sample-sb-external-db and webapps/<something else> ?
11:22 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, don't think so... looks like just the one sample-external... directory. I get this other weird message too after the initial deploymnet --
