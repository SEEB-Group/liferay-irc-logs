09:46 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, ! \o/
09:47 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, remember when you shared with me a recipe for how to build the portal from github?
09:47 <@jhf:#liferay> yah...
09:47 < jardineworks:#liferay> i lost it :(
09:47 < jardineworks:#liferay> can you share again? jrmiah was asking about it and when I went to look for it, could not be found
09:48 <@jhf:#liferay> you mean the “build portal and plugins manually” here: https://www.liferay.com/community/wiki/-/wiki/Main/BugSquad+-+Liferay+Portal+6.2+CE+Milestone+6+Testing#section-BugSquad+-+Liferay+Portal+6.2+CE+Milestone+6+Testing-Building+Portal+and+Plugins+Manually
09:50 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, that will probably do --- but I think you gave me some kinda personal version. Though maybe you were just copying from this :)
09:50 <@jhf:#liferay> hah probably :) you’ll need to replace the names of the directories and such..
09:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> and you had something about ant... you had to pass a jvm arg for more mem or soemthing.
10:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> bijoo_, do you use ANT of Maven for your plugins?
