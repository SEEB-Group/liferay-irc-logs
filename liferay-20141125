04:58 < winem_:#liferay> good morning, I have a Q regarding user authentication with an LDAP
04:59 < winem_:#liferay> I understood the hierarchy of liferay portal instance -> organisation -> organization unit / locality -> users
04:59 < winem_:#liferay> but how can I connect against different ldaps? do I have to configure the ldap connection and assign the users / groups it returns from our ldap to the organization manually?
05:02 < winem_:#liferay> did not find any option "below" organization to add an ldap. only the functionality in the general users management. control panel -> portal settings -> authentication -> ldap
05:02 < winem_:#liferay> am I right and I have to add the ldap and assign the users after the initial import from the ldap to an organization?
05:46 < aqquadro:#liferay> hi there
05:47 < aqquadro:#liferay> when I map a struts-action is needed to attach a specific permission to get accessible from a logged user?
06:59 < topolik:#liferay> winem_: hi, I think there is a possibility to map LDAP users into Liferay User Groups and then assign User Group among Organization members
07:23 < winem_:#liferay> perfect, that's what I wanted to hear, thank you :)
07:55 < g33kyboi:#liferay> I want to use my existing database with liferay. I have implemented a login hook such that when a user logs in, I intercept the process and verify the details with my db. Upon successful validation I get redirected to the login page without any error message. I suppose liferay still goes ahead to check its db for the same user. If so, is it possible to override this persistent check and rather provide a liferay user object instead? I do not want to create dummy
08:32 < topolik:#liferay> g33kyboi: try to look at auth.pipeline.enable.liferay.check
08:38 < jardineworks:#liferay> hi topolik
08:57 < topolik:#liferay> hi jardineworks
08:58 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik, just wanted to say hi -- see how things are going.
09:01 < topolik:#liferay> things are fine :) still not in jail for hacking ;) #joke
09:02 < jardineworks:#liferay> topolik, lucky you -- I am writing from my cell ;)
