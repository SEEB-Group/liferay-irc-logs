05:19 < Axxell:#liferay> hey guys, im really bad at aui, and im trying to do a function in my theme for opening modal windows with webcontent...
05:20 < Axxell:#liferay> what ive done is this in my main.js: http://pastebin.com/8vEWvGW5
05:20 < Axxell:#liferay> needless to say its now working, any clues?
05:28 < Axxell:#liferay> the error it gives is undefined is not a function
06:05 < Axxell:#liferay> okey now i can get the dialog to open
06:05 < Axxell:#liferay> but i cant get the url to be built correctly
06:06 < Axxell:#liferay> doing it like this http://pastebin.com/3TwmEpt8
06:07 < Axxell:#liferay> any clues how to get a url to display only a webcontent without anything extra?
06:11 < Axxell:#liferay> it just shows an empty webcontent display, with no web content chosen
06:32 < Axxell:#liferay> mkay got it to work, the building of the url was wrong in the example
07:17 < modd_:#liferay> hi jhf, do you have a minute?
07:20 < Axxell:#liferay> does anyone have a prebuilt version of Vaadin control panel for liferay 6.2? the one liferay marketplace is for liferay 6.1 only
07:24 < modd_:#liferay> not me, sry
07:38 < modd_:#liferay> hey topolik1, will your filesystemhook for the doclib work with 6.2?
07:53 < gittish:#liferay> I get " Unable to extend session for admin-web-configurator-portlet".
07:54 < gittish:#liferay> How can I get rid of it?
07:54 < gittish:#liferay> The port let is only used on startup.
07:54 < gittish:#liferay> and we have auto extend on for sessions
07:55 < modd_:#liferay> lr 6.2?
07:57 < gittish:#liferay> 6.1.1
07:59 < gittish:#liferay> (my build brok when trying 6.2)
07:59 < Axxell:#liferay> trying to compile this thing here
07:59 < Axxell:#liferay> https://github.com/arcusys/liferay-vaadin-plugin
07:59 < Axxell:#liferay> cant get it to work
08:00 < Axxell:#liferay> the first part of enviroment setup with some parent pom, works..
08:01 < Axxell:#liferay> but when i try to compile the main pom it says "Non-resolvable parent POM:"
08:08 < gittish:#liferay> Axxell: see if you can find it, otherwise you can most likely remove the parent pom reference
08:10 < Axxell:#liferay> gittish: never used maven before, they write: "This project uses some open source libraries that are not available in the default Maven central (repo1.maven.org). All linked artifacts are available in repository http://oss.arcusys.com/mvn/content/groups/public. That repository is specified in element of this project, but because our parent pom is also located in that repository, we need to fetch it first by invoking a special 'bootstra
08:11 < Axxell:#liferay> gittish: that thing i can run, and it completes ok, but when the main pom.xml is run it gets that error about parent pom, and i think its point to whatever that earlier command did
08:11 < Axxell:#liferay> gittish:"    <parent>         <groupId>com.arcusys</groupId>         <artifactId>arcusys-oss-project</artifactId>         <version>13.3.1</version>     </parent>"
08:16 < Axxell:#liferay> i really have no clue how to set this thing up, followed the instructions, but im guessing that there is more that needs to be configured to compile that thing
08:22 < Axxell:#liferay> gittish: btw the relative path of the parent pom is not specified in pom.xml
08:23 < Axxell:#liferay> if anybody feels like trying to compile that thing, please do :) im getting nowhere
08:26 < gittish:#liferay> the parent pom is looked up using you local repo and your repository settings
08:27 < gittish:#liferay> it could be anywhere
08:27 < gittish:#liferay> so referring to that repo should work, but I don't know this project
08:29 < gittish:#liferay> maven also remembers fail sure to find items for a while, so sometimes you may want to cleanup parts of the .m2 directory in order to retry quickly
08:40 < wela:#liferay> I tried to setup liferay on opensuse, but i get the following error
08:40 < wela:#liferay> Unable to set localhost. This prevents creation of a GUID. Cause was
08:41 < Axxell:#liferay> i got it to compile some more but it now things the following "[ERROR]     'dependencies.dependency.version' for com.liferay.portal:portal-serv ice:jar must be a valid version but is '${liferay.version}'. @ line 86, column 2 2"
09:13 < wela:#liferay> all the pre-installed liferay portlets refersh the whole page on any action
09:13 < wela:#liferay> any idea how to make it refersh only the needed portlet??
09:48 < gittish:#liferay> Axxell: try -Dliferay.version=6.2.0 (or whatever) on the maven command line
09:48 < gittish:#liferay> or define in out m2 settings files
09:53 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, learned something interesting yesterday for the ssl stuff
09:54 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, the themeDisplay.getPathThemeImages() takes whatever protocol/host comes in on the request. So that means to avoid mixed content for pages that are rewritten to use SSL I have to pass SSL down from apache to tomcat.
10:47 <@jhf:#liferay> well that is interesting.
10:47 <@jhf:#liferay> *checks source code*
10:50 -!- mode/#liferay [+o rotty3000] by ChanServ
11:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, I set up my server to support both ssl and non and depending on the context with which I access it, I get the http or https ... its not a big issue but it means we can't REALLY do full SSL termination at apache.
11:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> unless we hardcode the page asset links *barf*
11:02 <@jhf:#liferay> dang. yeah I see that this changed in 6.0 to consider the protocol/host - see https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/commit/f5f22289ddf289d92b64a6d18ec200ee41d0ec6f
11:02 <@jhf:#liferay> that's why that wiki page doesn't show the full path - it was based on 5.2 output
11:06 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, its not a huge deal really. SSL is slowet because of the network latency I think right? all those extra ACK SYN requests. I imagine the proxy and the server will be pretty close together :)
11:07 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah it's definitely slower, but unless you've got huge traffic it's probably not noticeable.
11:07 <@jhf:#liferay> plus you can get one of those cool "secure" badges that mean nothing
11:08 <@jhf:#liferay> I'm pretty sure your private ssl key is sitting in your tomcat directory unprotected
11:08 <@jhf:#liferay> ;-)
11:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> lol
11:20 < jardineworks:#liferay> jhf, we'll probably used a self signed cert between apache and tomcat anyway :)
11:21 <@jhf:#liferay> well you'll need a real cert unless you want your end users to get warnings/failured!
11:21 <@jhf:#liferay> between apache and the world
11:25 < topolik1:#liferay> modd: hi
11:26 < topolik1:#liferay> if you want I can adapt it for 6.2
11:29 < modd:#liferay> topolik1: would be really cool! :D
11:29 < topolik1:#liferay> hehe :) do you use it?
11:31 < modd:#liferay> I used it back at my former company and today I found a project at my new company, there they use it too and I have a new project, which could also use it..but this time it's lr 6.2
11:31 < modd:#liferay> so it seems, that a lot of people are using it
11:31 < modd:#liferay> jhf: can you explain to me, how content sharing between parent- and sub-sites work? I don't get it^^
11:32 < modd:#liferay> maybe a blog post, so others can use it, too
11:32 <@jhf:#liferay> sure, one sec, lemme run through it an ensure it works the way I think it does :)
11:32 < modd:#liferay> because I didn't find any good information, how it actually works
11:33 < modd:#liferay> well, it does not work like I think it's meant to be^^
11:34 < topolik1:#liferay> modd: ok, I try to
11:34 < modd:#liferay> topolik1: great, I'll tell everybody about your work ;)
11:35 < topolik1:#liferay> right, tell everybody about Liferay! :)
11:35 < modd:#liferay> hehe
11:36 < modd:#liferay> btw, jhf, I heard, that we will organize a webinar about lr 6.2 which will be promoted on lr.com
11:36 < modd:#liferay> I'll have to prepare content for that^^
11:40 <@jhf:#liferay> modd: oh?? that's cool! i'd not heard of that! when will the webinar be?
11:40 < modd:#liferay> mid february, I guess..not sure
11:40 <@jhf:#liferay> also, for sharing - basically, child sites can 'see' content from the parent site. this includes web content articles, documents, etc.
11:41 <@jhf:#liferay> you have to configure it to display - it does not, for example, 'inherit' pages or layouts (that's what site templates and page templates are for)
11:41 < modd:#liferay> the only way to do it, was to use asset publisher, but I can use it even without content sharing
11:42 < modd:#liferay> a simple example with screenshots in a blogpost would be great
11:42 < modd:#liferay> I could try it then and maybe it's a bug, or I'm simply stupid^^
11:43 <@jhf:#liferay> well yes you can use asset publisher, or web content display to display shared content
11:43 <@jhf:#liferay> also, for child sites, you can restrict memberships based on membership in the parent site
11:43 < modd:#liferay> maybe, if I know the exact date, you can convince olaf to talk about  it on liferayradio^^
11:43 <@jhf:#liferay> like you can require any member of child to also be member of parent
11:43 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah that'd be awesome! will it be in German?
11:43 < modd:#liferay> yes
11:43 <@jhf:#liferay> I recently did one (last week) on 6.2
11:43 < modd:#liferay> I know ;)
11:45 < modd:#liferay> if I've let's say a blog post on site A there site B is a sub site of and content share is active, and the user is part of site B but not A, he don't see the blog post on site B, even if it's visible for guests
11:46 < modd:#liferay> like I say, maybe I'm doing something wrong and it will work if I try an example
11:48 <@jhf:#liferay> yes, that looks right. I think the 'sharing' only applies to apps that have been coded to support it, like asset publisher, web content display.
11:48 <@jhf:#liferay> I don't think content is 'automatically' and transparently shared the way you are thikning
11:49 < modd:#liferay> but for asset publisher it's useless, because I can use other sites as scopes, even if it's not a sub-site (btw. it fixes one of my old tickets in jira)
11:49 <@jhf:#liferay> yeah. when I just tried it with blogs, i was hoping the 'scope' tab would now allow selection of multiple scopes (sites) the way asset publisher does
11:50 < modd:#liferay> in web content I can change the scope and show a web content of another page for all users, even if the content shouldn't be visible because of permissions^^
11:52 <@jhf:#liferay> one thing you can do is to turn OFF sharing, so that the child site's asset publisher cannot see the parent site's content
11:53 <@jhf:#liferay> you can do that selectively for each site
11:53 < modd:#liferay> doesn't affect the asset publisher
11:53 < modd:#liferay> as I said, I can use any site as scope, even if it's not a sub-site
11:55 <@jhf:#liferay> when I turn off 'content sharing' on the parent site, I can no longer choose that site when configuring AP on the child site
11:58 < modd:#liferay> weird
11:59 < modd:#liferay> I'll check that again
13:26 < grahamh__:#liferay> Hello, I'm attempting to run through the official Liferay developer documentation. Specifically the hooks portion, and I just can't seem to satisfy a dependency: "Project 'marketplace-portlet-master' is missing required Java project: 'portal-master'	marketplace-portlet-master"
13:29 < grahamh__:#liferay> http://www.liferay.com/documentation/liferay-portal/6.2/development/-/ai/creating-a-hook-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-10-en just after the first "Note"
14:18 < grahamh__:#liferay> I figured out how to satisfy my dependency issue by importing the plug-ins repo as an eclipse project, and finding the missing jars and patching them in manually, but now that project has 9300+ java problems. So I did it wrong. How am I supposed to do this?
15:41 < grahamh__:#liferay> still trying to find the magic import recipe
