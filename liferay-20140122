05:19 < Axxell:#liferay> hey guys, im really bad at aui, and im trying to do a function in my theme for opening modal windows with webcontent...
05:20 < Axxell:#liferay> what ive done is this in my main.js: http://pastebin.com/8vEWvGW5
05:20 < Axxell:#liferay> needless to say its now working, any clues?
05:28 < Axxell:#liferay> the error it gives is undefined is not a function
06:05 < Axxell:#liferay> okey now i can get the dialog to open
06:05 < Axxell:#liferay> but i cant get the url to be built correctly
06:06 < Axxell:#liferay> doing it like this http://pastebin.com/3TwmEpt8
06:07 < Axxell:#liferay> any clues how to get a url to display only a webcontent without anything extra?
06:11 < Axxell:#liferay> it just shows an empty webcontent display, with no web content chosen
06:32 < Axxell:#liferay> mkay got it to work, the building of the url was wrong in the example
07:17 < modd_:#liferay> hi jhf, do you have a minute?
07:20 < Axxell:#liferay> does anyone have a prebuilt version of Vaadin control panel for liferay 6.2? the one liferay marketplace is for liferay 6.1 only
