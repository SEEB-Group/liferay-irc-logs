07:18 < sl33k1:#liferay> hi guys
07:18 < sl33k1:#liferay> trying to find me some information on user management -
07:18 < sl33k1:#liferay> hi rotty3000
07:18 < sl33k1:#liferay> i have added sites to user group, and added user to user group, but cant see the sites when i log in
07:36 < modd:#liferay> does the site have pages?
07:36 < sl33k1:#liferay> hey modd
07:37 < sl33k1:#liferay> modd: thanks for replying
07:37 < sl33k1:#liferay> the sites have pages, and i have even added portlets to it
07:37 < sl33k1:#liferay> Private Pages though
07:37 < sl33k1:#liferay> see what I have done....I have created a UserGroup
07:38 < modd:#liferay> if the site have pages visible for the site members and the users are part of a usergroup which is site member of the site, the site should appear in the drop down menu
07:39 < sl33k1:#liferay> modd: i am on liferay 6.1
07:39 < modd:#liferay> it's the same for 6.1
07:40 < sl33k1:#liferay> how do i make pages visible for site members?
07:40 < sl33k1:#liferay> i havent assigned any permissions at all
07:40 < sl33k1:#liferay> I Just created userGroup and added private pages,
07:40 < modd:#liferay> usually it's default
07:40 < sl33k1:#liferay> But I have not explicitly created a Site
07:40 < sl33k1:#liferay> And assigned Site to Group
07:41 < sl33k1:#liferay> Can I create independent site and assign Site to A Group?
07:41 < modd:#liferay> sites are standalone or related to organizations
07:41 < modd:#liferay> you need a site to have pages
07:42 < sl33k1:#liferay> hmmm
07:42 < sl33k1:#liferay> i didnt create Site initially
07:42 < modd:#liferay> then nothing will appear
07:43 < sl33k1:#liferay> Let me try all over again....see what I want to achieve. I am creating a Grid Based app. multiple companies (with different themes) using my FooApplication (that has multiple portlets, and site)
07:43 < sl33k1:#liferay> Based on UserGroup, users see different sites
07:43 < sl33k1:#liferay> Can A Page show based on UserGroup?
07:43 < modd:#liferay> no
07:43 < modd:#liferay> usergroups are only collections of users
07:43 < sl33k1:#liferay> i.e 1 site with say 5 pages. and depending on user group, either 3 pages or 5pages show based on usergroups
07:44 < modd:#liferay> for all permissions you need roles
07:44 < sl33k1:#liferay> So its best I just group Pages in Sites then
07:44 < sl33k1:#liferay> Site A : All the 5 pages. Site B: Can Just have 3 pages
07:44 < sl33k1:#liferay> ?
07:44 < modd:#liferay> or users in roles..it depends on what you expecting how your rolesystem may change
07:45 < sl33k1:#liferay> For my FooApplication, I have both Foo_Admin and Foo_User kind of user groups
07:46 < modd:#liferay> you need roles not usergroups for such permissionsystem
07:46 < sl33k1:#liferay> modd: okay.
07:46 < modd:#liferay> however, if you like 500 "usergroups" it's a bad idea to create 500 roles^^
07:47 < modd:#liferay> the private pages you have created should appear in the users private site i guess
07:47 < sl33k1:#liferay> modd: but can a UserGroup have a collection of sites such that if i add a user to group, he has access to the sites. And sites inherit the Themes of organisation by default?
07:47 < modd:#liferay> a usergroup cannot have any site, not even one
07:47 < modd:#liferay> but a site can have multiple usergroups as site members
07:48 < sl33k1:#liferay> that should work too
07:48 < modd:#liferay> :)
07:48 < sl33k1:#liferay> modd: site would inherit organisation themes right?
07:48 < sl33k1:#liferay> modd: two more things, if you could help i'll be glad...
07:49 < sl33k1:#liferay> 1) A clear way or code sample to automate this process in java code. all the samples have seen are so lenghthyyyyyyyyyyyy
07:49 < modd:#liferay> site inheritance doesn't work properly...in 6.1 it even does not exist at all
07:49 < sl33k1:#liferay> Aaaaarggggggghhhhhhhhhhhh
07:50 < sl33k1:#liferay> i have used site inheritancee in past but not dynamically though
07:50 < modd:#liferay> well, creating sites in java isn't that hard
07:50 < sl33k1:#liferay> see portal.schoolonlinegrid.com and  methodistboyshighschoollagos.com all same portal
07:50 < sl33k1:#liferay> theme based on domain name or so cant remv exactly
07:51 < modd:#liferay> you can set a theme for every site
07:52 < modd:#liferay> if you want to do it java anyway, then just add a line to set the theme, no inheritance neccessary
07:52 < modd:#liferay> -c
07:52 < sl33k1:#liferay> I would have two Sites FOO_ADMIN_SITE and FOO_USER_SITE.
07:52 < sl33k1:#liferay> only once
07:52 < sl33k1:#liferay> Companies would add these two sites
07:52 < modd:#liferay> or just one site with site members and site admins
07:52 < sl33k1:#liferay> and based on user group/site relationship, users would be members somehow
07:53 < sl33k1:#liferay> so i need that site template inheritance based on org
07:53 < sl33k1:#liferay> as themes would be assigned only to org
07:57 < sl33k1:#liferay> modd: where can I find sample code on this please?
07:57 < sl33k1:#liferay> create/add members to site, usergroup, users
08:06 < sl33k1:#liferay> modd: okay, the site/usergroup thing works fine now
08:06 < sl33k1:#liferay> modd: can I ask about how to set the default user landing page, such that user doesnt have to select the Site when log in? i.e no welcome page
08:11 < modd:#liferay> you cannot set the default landing page per user
08:11 < modd:#liferay> to create a user use userlocalserviceutil
08:12 < modd:#liferay> usergrouplocalserviceutil for groups
08:12 < modd:#liferay> and grouplocalserviceutil for sites
08:13 < modd:#liferay> I could paste some code snippets on how to do it, but you will have to wait untill tomorrow :\
08:13 < modd:#liferay> what local time do you have right now?
08:18 < modd:#liferay> <modd> you cannot set the default landing page per user
08:18 < modd:#liferay> <modd> to create a user use userlocalserviceutil
08:18 < modd:#liferay> <modd> usergrouplocalserviceutil for groups
08:18 < modd:#liferay> <modd> and grouplocalserviceutil for sites
08:19 < modd:#liferay> <modd> I could paste some code snippets on how to do it, but you will have to wait untill tomorrow :\
08:19 < modd:#liferay> <modd> what local time do you have right now?
09:16 < sl33k1:#liferay> modd: hiya
09:16 < sl33k1:#liferay> modd: i created an organisation in liferay 6.1, trying to edit it, no place whatsoever where they mention look and feel
