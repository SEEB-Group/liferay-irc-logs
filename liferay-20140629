07:18 < sl33k1:#liferay> hi guys
07:18 < sl33k1:#liferay> trying to find me some information on user management -
07:18 < sl33k1:#liferay> hi rotty3000
07:18 < sl33k1:#liferay> i have added sites to user group, and added user to user group, but cant see the sites when i log in
07:36 < modd:#liferay> does the site have pages?
07:36 < sl33k1:#liferay> hey modd
07:37 < sl33k1:#liferay> modd: thanks for replying
07:37 < sl33k1:#liferay> the sites have pages, and i have even added portlets to it
07:37 < sl33k1:#liferay> Private Pages though
07:37 < sl33k1:#liferay> see what I have done....I have created a UserGroup
07:38 < modd:#liferay> if the site have pages visible for the site members and the users are part of a usergroup which is site member of the site, the site should appear in the drop down menu
07:39 < sl33k1:#liferay> modd: i am on liferay 6.1
07:39 < modd:#liferay> it's the same for 6.1
07:40 < sl33k1:#liferay> how do i make pages visible for site members?
07:40 < sl33k1:#liferay> i havent assigned any permissions at all
07:40 < sl33k1:#liferay> I Just created userGroup and added private pages,
07:40 < modd:#liferay> usually it's default
07:40 < sl33k1:#liferay> But I have not explicitly created a Site
07:40 < sl33k1:#liferay> And assigned Site to Group
07:41 < sl33k1:#liferay> Can I create independent site and assign Site to A Group?
07:41 < modd:#liferay> sites are standalone or related to organizations
07:41 < modd:#liferay> you need a site to have pages
07:42 < sl33k1:#liferay> hmmm
07:42 < sl33k1:#liferay> i didnt create Site initially
07:42 < modd:#liferay> then nothing will appear
07:43 < sl33k1:#liferay> Let me try all over again....see what I want to achieve. I am creating a Grid Based app. multiple companies (with different themes) using my FooApplication (that has multiple portlets, and site)
07:43 < sl33k1:#liferay> Based on UserGroup, users see different sites
07:43 < sl33k1:#liferay> Can A Page show based on UserGroup?
07:43 < modd:#liferay> no
07:43 < modd:#liferay> usergroups are only collections of users
07:43 < sl33k1:#liferay> i.e 1 site with say 5 pages. and depending on user group, either 3 pages or 5pages show based on usergroups
07:44 < modd:#liferay> for all permissions you need roles
07:44 < sl33k1:#liferay> So its best I just group Pages in Sites then
07:44 < sl33k1:#liferay> Site A : All the 5 pages. Site B: Can Just have 3 pages
07:44 < sl33k1:#liferay> ?
07:44 < modd:#liferay> or users in roles..it depends on what you expecting how your rolesystem may change
