05:28 < Axxell:#liferay> jesus my bloodpressure got pretty high, when both of my "production"servers went down at the same time, came here for advice but fixed it on my own.. server1 bug in my fine little app corrupted reindexing, server2: unknown to me the CAS server was updated and moved
06:35 < sm`:#liferay> morning everyone
06:35 < sm`:#liferay> im trying to save photo uploaded by user
06:36 < sm`:#liferay> and it works fine on my local machine and the dev env
06:36 < sm`:#liferay> liferay 6.1 CE and 6.1 EE respectivly
06:36 < sm`:#liferay> but it doent work on teh preprod
06:36 < sm`:#liferay> i belive it should be 6.1 ee
06:36 < sm`:#liferay> but ill need to confirm that with the sysadmins
06:37 < sm`:#liferay> until then does anyone have a clue
06:37 < sm`:#liferay> heres the isolated line that throws the 'cant cast' exception
06:37 < sm`:#liferay> http://pastebin.com/VnAtntfZ
08:19 < Axxell:#liferay> sm: reminds me a bit of the "can not be cast" which i get with service builder when i deploy a new version of a portlet using the service builder...
08:20 < Axxell:#liferay> sm: only a restart helps there
08:20 < Axxell:#liferay> so`: um hum
08:22 < sm`:#liferay> you always restart your server when you deploy new version of any portlet using SB?
08:22 < sm`:#liferay> id want to find a better solution
08:23 < sm`:#liferay> we cant afford downtime here :)
09:13 < Axxell:#liferay> yeah, didnt find any solution to the problem with the can not cast with servicebuilder, people talked about just doing a new portlet in eclipse and it would fix itself
09:13 < Axxell:#liferay> but that didnt help
09:14 < Axxell:#liferay> so people do experience that specific problem with liferay 6.2 when using servicbuilder with many to many releationsships
09:14 < Axxell:#liferay> there are some who talk about puting the service in the lib folder, but that doesnt help
09:15 < Axxell:#liferay> so long story short, nothing i can do about it when not using EE
09:17 < Axxell:#liferay> so everytime i update that specific portlet my site says "updating, please try again later" :) and after i restart lfieray the portlet works again
09:18 < Axxell:#liferay> it takes about 200s to restart,
09:27 < sm`:#liferay> well im not sure if that will fix the problem cuz my portlet runs fine
09:27 < sm`:#liferay> except for this action
09:30 < Axxell:#liferay> well actually here the portlet runs fine also when not accessing the service, when doing that it says: com.liferay.portal.kernel.messaging.MessageListenerException: java.lang.ClassCastException: xxxx.model.impl.xxxxImpl cannot be cast to xxxx.model.xxxxAdress
09:30 < Axxell:#liferay> and more of the same
09:31 < Axxell:#liferay> well of to the gym and then its one day of vacation time for me
10:33 < bwood:#liferay> So I hear AlloyUI 3.0 was released, it's of no use to Liferay Portal correct?
10:40 < jardineworks:#liferay> winem_, calling in that Linux question favour :)
