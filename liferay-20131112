04:42 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Morning.
04:42 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Someone here who knows the scheduler tasks in Liferay well?
04:42 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I wonder if there is some way of setting a task up properly for a clustered environment.
04:43 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> We have some tasks that should be run regularly, but only once for the entire cluster.
04:44 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Is it possible to either limit tasks to one node or maybe have some kind of locking mechanism that will prevent the task from running simultaneously on all nodes?
05:00 < hufg:#liferay> helloo heloo
05:12 < CorneA:#liferay> @Tar-Minyatur the <scheduler-entry> in a Portlet should be run only once if the cluster is properly setup
05:13 < CorneA:#liferay> you might force it also with scheduler.enabled=false on one of the nodes
05:15 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I can't provide different configurations for separate nodes.
05:15 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> They all have the same setup.
05:16 < hufg:#liferay> any ideas if there is an aui tag/js thing that will render  a portlet with some params
05:16 < CorneA:#liferay> look at memory.cluster.scheduler.lock.cache.enabled and memory.scheduler.org.quartz....
05:17 < CorneA:#liferay> Anyway it should work fine OOTB which LR version do you use?
07:12 < bentech4you:#liferay> how can i configure liferay6.2 with active directory?
08:17 < emmeljay:#liferay> I am wondering can the process for uploading images in a Web Content portlet be simplified? Is the default folder configurable?
08:19 < emmeljay:#liferay> When users want to upload a picture they have to identify a destination folder and the default destination folder isthe root folder which (understandably) gives an error message if user try to load their file into it.
08:21 < emmeljay:#liferay> is there a way to configure the Web Content Portlet so that the default destination folder is the site folder?
08:21 < emmeljay:#liferay> has anyone asked this question before?
08:42 < hufg:#liferay> uhuh how do i load the Liferay.Util javascript..stuff?
08:44 < hufg:#liferay> emmeljay: see portal.properties for your configuration needs
08:44 < hufg:#liferay> if i had to guess it's not configurable
08:45 < emmeljay:#liferay> hufg: cheers
08:46 < emmeljay:#liferay> I was hoping you wouldn;t say that
08:49 < hufg:#liferay> the fucking jsp tag, aui, liferay js combination pisses me off
08:49 < hufg:#liferay> very complex :Z
08:50 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Why can't s3cmd do a recursive copy? Oo
09:04 < jardineworks:#liferay> hufg, +1
09:10 < hufg:#liferay> jardineworks: any ideas how to load Liferay.Util ?
09:10 < hufg:#liferay> i'm trying to create a popup that shows control panel/workflow tasks screen
09:11 < hufg:#liferay> i have the correct url just fighting with the popup :D
09:11 < hufg:#liferay> doing it with aui-dialog breaks everything(??)
09:13 < hufg:#liferay> i would like to try my luck with Liferay.Util.openWindow()
09:17 < hufg:#liferay> css "leaks" on the page that opens the dialog
09:17 < hufg:#liferay> at least seems like it
09:21 < hufg:#liferay> http://www.liferay.com/community/wiki/-/wiki/Main/Using+Pop-up+in+Liferay?_36_pageResourcePrimKey=1379861
09:22 < hufg:#liferay> the example  Floating Div Pop-up in 6.1 # results into the same behaviour
09:22 < hufg:#liferay> http://www.liferay.com/community/wiki/-/wiki/Main/Using+Pop-up+in+Liferay#section-Using+Pop-up+in+Liferay-Floating+Div+Pop-up+in+6.1
09:22 < hufg:#liferay> then there is the goddamned openWindow
09:22 < hufg:#liferay> :D
09:23 < hufg:#liferay> and yess there it is liferay-util-window
09:24 < jardineworks:#liferay> I've never used it... you should ask dblessing... I know he was doing some popup stuff with alloy a while back.
09:24 < jardineworks:#liferay> found another awesome bug. If you layout template name is the same as you page name, it won't apply. But it also won't show any errors
09:24 < jardineworks:#liferay> in fact, it will tell you that is saved.
09:27 < jardineworks:#liferay> hufg, what do you mean css leaks?
09:27 < hufg:#liferay> jardineworks: it loads the dialog into a div and a css hell breaks loose
09:28 < hufg:#liferay> the dialog happens to be portlet rendered in control_panel
09:28 < hufg:#liferay> dialog content i mean
09:29 < jardineworks:#liferay> hufg, so you're trying to provide inline admin functionality?
09:29 < hufg:#liferay> essentially yes
09:29 < hufg:#liferay> i have the url and params worked out
09:30 < hufg:#liferay> it's such a far cry from anything humane editing jsp files in gedit and digging into liferay jsp tag tlds and js files :D
09:31 < jardineworks:#liferay> hufg, I am assuming that you aren't using the same theme for your control panel right?
09:31 < hufg:#liferay> yeah
09:31 < jardineworks:#liferay> and that your current theme is not using control panel as a parent?
09:32 < jardineworks:#liferay> if you dump one of your own portlets (that is skinned for your theme) is it still all screwed up?
09:32 < dblessing:#liferay> popups in alloy :-\ not all that fun. but then i approach JS with nearly no knowledge
09:32 < hufg:#liferay> dblessing: same here
09:33 < hufg:#liferay> jardineworks: not sure what you mean, but anyways it's possible to get it working properly with Liferay.Util.openWindow the problem is just that i can't seem to get access to that particular method
09:33 < hufg:#liferay> in the wiki the module is 'liferay-util-window'
09:33 < hufg:#liferay> which i suppose should work like this <aui:script use="aui-node, liferay-util-window">
09:33 < hufg:#liferay> but no
09:35 < jardineworks:#liferay> hufg, I always use a regular scrip tag and then put the AUI().use('...')
09:36 < jardineworks:#liferay> I have never been able to get the aui:script tag to work consistently for me and my JS knowledge isn't advanced enough (either) to troubleshoot :)
09:38 < hufg:#liferay> hehe
10:00 < hufg:#liferay> OK
10:00 < hufg:#liferay> great success
10:01 < hufg:#liferay> the problem was between the screen and chair
10:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> PECAK
10:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> problem exists between keyboard and chair
10:01 < jardineworks:#liferay> what was it you were doing wrong?
10:01 < hufg:#liferay> had a typo, you don't need to load Liferay.Util
10:30 < imox1234:#liferay> how can I set the email settings?
10:33 < jardineworks:#liferay> imox1234, the control panel
10:33 < imox1234:#liferay> where :D
10:33 < jardineworks:#liferay> imox1234, or I think you can set it in the portal-ext.properties
10:33 < imox1234:#liferay> control panel sounds better
10:34 < imox1234:#liferay> where in the panel?
10:34 < jardineworks:#liferay> wow
10:34 < jardineworks:#liferay> that is pretty lazy man
10:34 < imox1234:#liferay> xD
10:34 < jardineworks:#liferay> Portal > Portal Settings
10:34 < jardineworks:#liferay> mail domain
10:34 < imox1234:#liferay> hmm I don't have
10:34 < imox1234:#liferay> mail domain
10:35 < jardineworks:#liferay> what version
10:35 < imox1234:#liferay> 6.0.6
10:35 < jardineworks:#liferay> in the portal-ext.properties you can override the defaults with these properties --
10:35 < jardineworks:#liferay>     #
10:35 < jardineworks:#liferay>     # Set the properties used to create the Java Mail session. The property
10:35 < jardineworks:#liferay>     # prefix "mail.session." will be removed before it is used to create the
10:35 < jardineworks:#liferay>     # session object. These properties will only be read if the property
10:35 < jardineworks:#liferay>     # "mail.session.jndi.name" is not set.
10:35 < jardineworks:#liferay>     #
10:35 < jardineworks:#liferay>     mail.session.mail.pop3.host=localhost
10:35 < jardineworks:#liferay>     mail.session.mail.pop3.password=
10:35 < jardineworks:#liferay>     mail.session.mail.pop3.port=110
10:35 < jardineworks:#liferay>     mail.session.mail.pop3.user=
10:35 < jardineworks:#liferay>     mail.session.mail.smtp.auth=false
10:35 < jardineworks:#liferay>     mail.session.mail.smtp.host=localhost
10:35 < imox1234:#liferay> why pop3?
10:35 < jardineworks:#liferay>     mail.session.mail.smtp.password=
10:35 < jardineworks:#liferay>     mail.session.mail.smtp.port=25
10:36 < jardineworks:#liferay>     mail.session.mail.smtp.user=
10:36 < jardineworks:#liferay>     mail.session.mail.store.protocol=pop3
10:36 < jardineworks:#liferay>     mail.session.mail.transport.protocol=smtp
10:36 < imox1234:#liferay> ok
10:36 < imox1234:#liferay> jardineworks: not possible to set it in the control panel?
10:36 < jardineworks:#liferay> (checking...)
10:36 < jardineworks:#liferay> though I am on 6.1
10:37 < jardineworks:#liferay> yes
10:37 < jardineworks:#liferay> Server ? Server Administration > Mail tab
10:40 < imox1234:#liferay> hmmm
10:41 < imox1234:#liferay> I moved the this life ray to another server
10:42 < imox1234:#liferay> and there are no settings in the properties files
10:48 < imox1234:#liferay> jardineworks: have you any idea?
10:55 < jardineworks:#liferay> your portal-ex.properties file is empty?
10:55 < jardineworks:#liferay> did you copy the TOMCAT_HOME or LIFERAY_HOME?
11:04 < imox1234:#liferay> the whole life ray folder and lifeay_home folder
11:05 < imox1234:#liferay> yes my portal file is empty
11:15 < imox1234:#liferay> jardineworks: ;) ?
11:25 < jardineworks:#liferay> copy it
11:25 < jardineworks:#liferay> from the other server and restart
11:31 < imox1234:#liferay> ok I found it
11:31 < imox1234:#liferay> the easiest way to test it ;) ?
11:39 < imox1234:#liferay> jardineworks: hmmm http://pastebin.com/sH4qnw92
11:45 < imox1234:#liferay> ok know works
11:45 < imox1234:#liferay> thanks
14:41 < vernon:#liferay> Congrats to David if he is here :-D
15:03 < modd:#liferay> thx
16:04 < darkos:#liferay> I am seeing a problem with 6.2 Dynamic Data Lists.
16:06 < darkos:#liferay> I have added the dynamic data form add-on without issues.
16:07 < darkos:#liferay> if I create a dynamic data list data definition, and use the form add-on to create data just using the definition, submissions seem to arrive properly.
16:08 < darkos:#liferay> if I then create a template that uses some of the available widgets to group items together and give them a heading, it appears that none of the data in those grouped/nested elements is arriving in the data record upon form submission.
16:09 < darkos:#liferay> eg: create a ddl data definition that has first_name, last_name, phone and email fields.
16:10 < darkos:#liferay> but, in the template, create a group for 'name' and move the 'first_name' and 'last_name' fields to be within the 'name' container, and you will probably find that no values entered into the ddl form when using that template will arrive in the database.
16:10 < darkos:#liferay> I have tried this on windows using both the glassfish and tomcat bundles, using jdk 7u45, and they both behave the same way.
16:12 < darkos:#liferay> so, it appears that putting input fields nested within the container widgets causes marshalling issues
16:15 < darkos:#liferay> oh, I should correct myself, by saying that data that is not within a containing widget *does* appear to make it to the database row.  only those items that are no longer at the root level fail to make it to the database.  in my example, that would be the first_name and last_name values.
16:23 < darkos:#liferay> unless I am mistaken, I thought that this would be something that is intended to be done, based on the grouping widget not being available for the data definition side of things.
