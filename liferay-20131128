08:36 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Hey guys...anyone got experience with using CDN in Liferay?
08:37 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Apparently there is a bug that leads to SCSS being retrieved from CDN even when cdn.dynamic.resources.enabled=false is set.
09:36 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, is there an issue reported on jira?
09:37 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, I haven't configured our CDN yet but I will be shortly... this might be something I need to look into as well.
09:44 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I haven't found anything in the issue tracker yet.
09:45 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Our offshore developer suggested to either implement a hook to fix that or to build a new portal-web.war with the capability to deal with SCSS on the fly...or something like that.
09:47 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, I wonder if maybe that property you referenced is colliding, or is dependent or whatever on the localized css property? There is another one for dynamic css... one sec.
09:47 < jardineworks:#liferay> com.liferay.portal.servlet.filters.dynamiccss.DynamicCSSFilter=false
09:49 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Mhm.
09:49 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I guess it's worth a try.
09:51 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, let me know if that helps at all. Need to know whether or not I need to add something to my list.
09:56 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Hrm. I'm not sure that this would really help.
09:57 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Sounds to me like this would just deactivate some stuff in Liferay if we wanted to deliver the stuff ourselves or something.
09:58 < jardineworks:#liferay> Tar-Minyatur, I think so, but sometimes these filters get blended... or have unexpected dependencies. It would only take a minute to try it, and you never know!
09:58 < jardineworks:#liferay> :)
10:15 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Oh man. I'm so stupid.
10:15 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I totally forgot that I could also just try it on my local box.
10:15 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I was so involved with setting up the test system over the past days...totally messing with my head.
10:18 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> jardineworks: Deactivating the dynamic css filter doesn't work.
10:18 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> It breaks even more.
10:18 < jardineworks:#liferay> lol
10:19 < jardineworks:#liferay> your welcome. :)
10:19 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> It was worth a try. ;)
10:31 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> I'm thinking about a different solution at the moment.
10:32 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> Instead of using Liferay's CDN settings, we could use redirects.
10:32 < Tar-Minyatur:#liferay> In a proxy/webserver that sits in front of Liferay we could bend all paths that point to /img or /images to the CDN.
