12:05 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> hi there
12:05 < apucay:#liferay> hi
12:05 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> does anyone know if shutting down the portal (with a page informing users) through admin pages is possible ?
12:05 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> like a switch in admin controls which allow to open or close the web site

12:15 < jardineworks:#liferay> nicolas_FR, I was looking for that a couple of weeks ago. Couldn't find it. Though in the api there are references to a MaitenanceUtil... and there is a maintenance.jsp
12:15 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> jardineworks: ok thanks
