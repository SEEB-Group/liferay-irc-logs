11:06 < jardineworks:#liferay> anyone in here use Maven for their projects? (6.2)??

12:05 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> hi there
12:05 < apucay:#liferay> hi
12:05 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> does anyone know if shutting down the portal (with a page informing users) through admin pages is possible ?
12:05 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> like a switch in admin controls which allow to open or close the web site

12:15 < jardineworks:#liferay> nicolas_FR, I was looking for that a couple of weeks ago. Couldn't find it. Though in the api there are references to a MaitenanceUtil... and there is a maintenance.jsp
12:15 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> jardineworks: ok thanks
12:16 < jardineworks:#liferay> nicolas_FR, I think ultimately you would want to use your proxy though incase you need to shut down the whole portal.
12:17 < jardineworks:#liferay> nicolas_FR, One of the guys I work with right now was telling me that in the apache rewrite rules you can use something to detect the presence of a file. He said normally they use that logic... if the "maintenance" file is there, then they redirect to a maintenance page.
12:17 < jardineworks:#liferay> nicolas_FR, which makes sense. I suppose it is tricky to do IN the portal since you need to get back into the site to turn maintenance off :)
12:18 < nicolas_FR:#liferay> jardineworks: I was looking for some user friendly solution to allow site admin to shut down the site (and maybe configure the maintenance message) directly from administration. Actually we use shell scripts to redirect users to a maintenance page directly from apache
