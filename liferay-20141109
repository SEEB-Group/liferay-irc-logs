11:04 < Jadobi:#liferay> Hi, i added a Web Content Displayed Portlet to a public site. But when a guest visits the page the portlet got not displayed. The Premission is set to view for guest uers. I use 6.2.1 CE GA2.
11:05 < Jadobi:#liferay> why is this not working?
11:05 < Jadobi:#liferay> Other Portlets show up
11:08 < Jadobi:#liferay> ooh ok i found this issue https://issues.liferay.com/browse/LPS-43427 :-(
11:09 < Jadobi:#liferay> Can i fix this with an ext-plugin ...
11:14 < Jadobi:#liferay> Can someone help me, fixing this issue please?
11:39 < Jadobi:#liferay> Ok the issue got fixed for 7.0.0 M1. Is there a way to see which classes got fixed???
11:50 < gogamoga:#liferay> hoi
11:50 < gogamoga:#liferay> i need someone to point me in the right direction
11:51 < gogamoga:#liferay> the issue i am experiencing is related to *httpservletrequest caching*
11:51 < gogamoga:#liferay> here how it goes:
11:52 < gogamoga:#liferay> xsl web-content template does some magic (reading cookies mostly)
11:52 < gogamoga:#liferay> i set cookies with javascript
11:53 < gogamoga:#liferay> now the nasty thing is, if the user is logged into liferay, everything works fine, when i change the cookie and reload the page, xslt sees it properly
11:53 < gogamoga:#liferay> the different case when the user is not logged in
11:53 < gogamoga:#liferay> cookies seem to not go through at all
11:53 < gogamoga:#liferay> suppose, i have a dummy url: host/test-page
11:54 < gogamoga:#liferay> when i set cookie with JS on this page, (for anonymous user), the template does not see the cookie at all
11:54 < gogamoga:#liferay> the only way to make the template see the cookie is doing nasty trick: host/test-page?some-random-stuff
11:54 < gogamoga:#liferay> only then the cookie goes through
11:55 < gogamoga:#liferay> and only for this random query string
11:55 < gogamoga:#liferay> if i go back to host/test-page it goes back to being blind again
11:55 < gogamoga:#liferay> is there a way to force the request not to cache this stuff?
11:55 < gogamoga:#liferay> (the template [ ] cacheable checkbox is unticked!)
11:56 < gogamoga:#liferay> appreciate any info
12:07 < gogamoga:#liferay> oh, forgot to mention, liferay 6.1.1
12:51 < Jadobi:#liferay> Can anybody help me????
12:59 < Jadobi:#liferay> Please, i need to get this fixed and i cannot move to 7.0.0 M1
13:02 < modd:#liferay> what's the problem?
