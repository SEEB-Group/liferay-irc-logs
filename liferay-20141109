11:04 < Jadobi:#liferay> Hi, i added a Web Content Displayed Portlet to a public site. But when a guest visits the page the portlet got not displayed. The Premission is set to view for guest uers. I use 6.2.1 CE GA2.
11:05 < Jadobi:#liferay> why is this not working?
11:05 < Jadobi:#liferay> Other Portlets show up
11:08 < Jadobi:#liferay> ooh ok i found this issue https://issues.liferay.com/browse/LPS-43427 :-(
11:09 < Jadobi:#liferay> Can i fix this with an ext-plugin ...
11:14 < Jadobi:#liferay> Can someone help me, fixing this issue please?
11:39 < Jadobi:#liferay> Ok the issue got fixed for 7.0.0 M1. Is there a way to see which classes got fixed???
11:50 < gogamoga:#liferay> hoi
11:50 < gogamoga:#liferay> i need someone to point me in the right direction
11:51 < gogamoga:#liferay> the issue i am experiencing is related to *httpservletrequest caching*
11:51 < gogamoga:#liferay> here how it goes:
11:52 < gogamoga:#liferay> xsl web-content template does some magic (reading cookies mostly)
11:52 < gogamoga:#liferay> i set cookies with javascript
11:53 < gogamoga:#liferay> now the nasty thing is, if the user is logged into liferay, everything works fine, when i change the cookie and reload the page, xslt sees it properly
11:53 < gogamoga:#liferay> the different case when the user is not logged in
11:53 < gogamoga:#liferay> cookies seem to not go through at all
11:53 < gogamoga:#liferay> suppose, i have a dummy url: host/test-page
11:54 < gogamoga:#liferay> when i set cookie with JS on this page, (for anonymous user), the template does not see the cookie at all
11:54 < gogamoga:#liferay> the only way to make the template see the cookie is doing nasty trick: host/test-page?some-random-stuff
11:54 < gogamoga:#liferay> only then the cookie goes through
11:55 < gogamoga:#liferay> and only for this random query string
11:55 < gogamoga:#liferay> if i go back to host/test-page it goes back to being blind again
11:55 < gogamoga:#liferay> is there a way to force the request not to cache this stuff?
11:55 < gogamoga:#liferay> (the template [ ] cacheable checkbox is unticked!)
11:56 < gogamoga:#liferay> appreciate any info
12:07 < gogamoga:#liferay> oh, forgot to mention, liferay 6.1.1
12:51 < Jadobi:#liferay> Can anybody help me????
12:59 < Jadobi:#liferay> Please, i need to get this fixed and i cannot move to 7.0.0 M1
13:02 < modd:#liferay> what's the problem?

13:12 < Jadobi:#liferay> any idea?
13:12 < modd:#liferay> moment
13:14 < modd:#liferay> did you set journal.article.view.permission.check.enabled=true?
13:15 < Jadobi:#liferay> in my portal-ext.properties  no
13:15 < modd:#liferay> try it
13:15 < Jadobi:#liferay> ok i will
13:16 < modd:#liferay> if it does not work, you could try to create an extension do the following changes: https://github.com/epgarcia/liferay-portal/commit/742e7cb2a8e5f472036d323789c6b3aad00e8773 + https://github.com/epgarcia/liferay-portal/commit/51cdd6baf7c8b2a9f1560037171e46b7b0ef3c06
13:16 < modd:#liferay> that's all I can do for now
13:16 < modd:#liferay> +to
13:18 < modd:#liferay> or follows this comment: "This issue is reproducible only if the first web content in the site is created through Site Admin > Content > Web Content. The moment a web content is created through the Web Content Display > Add option, all contents (including those previously created through Site Admin > Content > Web Content) are visible for guest users."
13:18 < modd:#liferay> hope it will help to fix your problem :)
13:19 < Jadobi:#liferay> I have created the content from the Web Content Display Portlet ... but i hope the config works
13:21 < Jadobi:#liferay> :-( nope didn't worked
13:22 < modd:#liferay> you could also by an EE license for a lot of money and get the patch for this issue, but I think, this proposal won't help at all ;)
13:24 < Jadobi:#liferay> yeah right ^^ poor student
13:27 < modd:#liferay> as a student, you can do something else: 1. get a 30days test license for EE and use EE + 2. ask for this certain fix - for students, they sometimes mail the patch if you ask kindly
13:33 < Jadobi:#liferay> good idea thx
13:35 < Jadobi:#liferay> Ok i will try ext first and thanks for your help! Cya
